"What are Bonds? Meaning, Types &amp; Features"," 

With so many investment options in the market, it can get a bit overwhelming at times with what could be the right investment approach.

And one of the golden investment wisdom we often get from our investment advisors is diversification of your investment portfolio with mutual funds (debt and equity funds), shares, gold, and bonds like government and corporate bonds.

[**Investment in Bonds**](https://www.ajmeraxchange.co.in/services/bonds) can play a key ingredient towards a balanced portfolio. If[ stock markets](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/what-to-do-when-stock-market-is-crashing) go down, bonds can help cushion the blow.

But not many aspiring investors have a thorough understanding of the bond market.¬†

They have looming questions in mind like, Are bonds a safe investment option?¬†

How much should I invest?

What are the returns?

Well, the first step to investing is to understand what to invest in.

For beginners, bonds are a great place to start. Many financial advisors are working hard to help people understand more about bonds, especially those considering investing in them.

So today for our readers, we will be talking about bonds.

We explore the meaning of bonds, types of bonds, and features of bonds.

**1. What are Bonds and how to invest?**

Bonds are a type of debt instrument that is issued by a government, a municipality, or a corporation (and sometimes by local authorities). They typically pay a fixed rate of interest every year. They come under fixed-income securities.

In simple terms, Bonds are considered a loan from an investor to a borrower such as a company or government, that involves borrowing money from lenders and then paying back the borrowed money to the bondholder by periodic payments over a fixed time period with interest. The borrowed amount is called the principal amount.

The one-time ""bond issuance"" is the money borrowed by the company for its operations, while the interest paid back to the lender is the principal amount. Over time though the market value of the bond can change.

Bonds are, therefore, essentially IOUs issued by businesses and governments.

Here, we will be exploring all about bonds. Listed below are some of the topics that we will be discussing through this blog.

Examining Inflation-Adjusted S&amp;P500 Returns Since Pre-Pandemic High (Feb 2020),"Hey all,

I've been wondering about how the S&amp;P500 has performed since the Pandemic began in real terms (adjusted for inflation).  I find it quite fascinating that we endured one of the hottest bull markets in history between Q2-2020 and Q4-2021, and yet indexes are only marginally higher than they were in Q1-2020.  

I hadn't seen much data posted on inflation-adjusted returns so I've compiled them here for your commentary.  All numbers are USD and are using US inflation data based on CPI data.  


* CPI Aug 2022: **123.1**
* CPI FEB 2020: **108.6**
* Change: 123.1/108.6 = **1.1335X**

S&amp;P500:

* S&amp;P500 Today: **3758**
* S&amp;P500 Feb 2020 High: **3390**
* Change: 3758/3390 = **1.108X**

Today's inflation-adjusted S&amp;P500 price 3390 on Feb 2020 (Pre-COVID high): 3842.5

So on a real basis, we are trading \~2.2% below pre-Pandemic levels. This is a 31-month return of -2.2% in real terms (-0.85% APR). Nominally, we are up about 10.8% from the pre-Pandemic highs (4.18% APR).

NASDAQ:

* NASDAQ Composite Today:  **11066**
* NASDAQ Composite Feb 2020 High: **9750**
* Change: 11066/9750 = **1.134X**

The Nasdaq has returned very close to 0% since pre-Pandemic highs, adjusted for inflation.  It has tracked CPI nearly 1-1 over the past 31 months.  

Some thoughts and takeaways.  2020-21 felt like the second coming of the '99 Tech Bubble.  Software companies were getting 100X+ Price-Sales valuations.  Work-from-home was supposed to have advanced the technology sector by 5-10 years in the span of one.  Companies like Zoom hit $100B+ valuations.  

It's quite astonishing how quickly everything went from bust to boom to bust again.  One year ago, it would be hard to fathom how the stock market could be down (inflation-adjusted) since pre-Pandemic levels.  After all, we were still in the midst of a face-ripping bull market.  It's quite sobering to see how quickly returns can vanish and even go well-below historic averages.

Throwing all your money into the stock market in Feb 2020 would have yielded a below-average nominal return, and a negative real return.

Should i purchase this?,"Hi all i want some feedback as i am very conservative with money. 

I make around 400k (in sales so this can fluctuate) last year. On pace to do around the same probably slightly more. Year before over 300. My wife makes around 65k but we just had a baby so she may decide she wants to be a stay at home mom. That totals us around 465 but i want to have a cushion in case of a recession etc.

We both max our 401k and have for years(plummeted this year but hopefully comes back), have some other investment accounts. Have 2 vehicles fully paid for no loans. I could sell mine for around 40k as it‚Äôs just a fun weekend car. We keep company stock accounts and other investment accounts in hand as well. We then keep around 80k in cash where we are earning almost no interest. We own a townhouse worth around 300 with 170 left on the mortgage. Plus another beach home with about 190 left. That property is worth around 360. We could have paid off one or other but rates on those houses average under 3% Apr. the townhouse we would most likely sell and i would love to not have to empty a bunch of cash etc to purchase a new house but in this market probably can‚Äôt make a contingent offer. I have been trying to pay the mortgage down quickly, but not too quick because of such a low APR. I also don‚Äôt want to just keep a bunch of cash on hand where I‚Äôm earning almost zero interest. That‚Äôs why only around 80 liquid. Second home mortgage is around 1200 a month. That is only debt So the question is 

A. Can i Afford a new build of 820.

B. What‚Äôs the best way to put down payment at 20% without having to liquidate but also not having to do A contingent offer?

I feel like a lose lose because if i keep so much cash on hand I‚Äôm earning zero interest and might not find a house for awhile.

I think this is it,"They‚Äôve pushed GME below $25. Think about it. It reeks of desperation and fear of loss. The SHFs have been scraping and clawing just to survive ‚Äúanother day‚Äù almost every day for over a year. Yet, here we are. Below $25 on four million volume. A price drop of 8% on less than 2% of all existing shares. First off, that‚Äôs crazy and clearly improbable. Secondly, almost all of that volume was short volume with little to no selling by retail, (maybe some by institutions, I don‚Äôt have the data so I can‚Äôt fully conclude that) and that‚Äôs the real kicker. 

The drop that we saw today was a combination of the broader market taking a swan dive into the ocean and short selling. Now think about this. Options above that price are going to become very greatly desired. I want to go ahead and preface this portion with buy, hold, DRS, but at the same time I want to make a point. I personally bought one call for a $26 strike and a 10/14 expiry, and while the stock continued to go down my call went UP in value. That screams incoming volatility especially with the low volume. 

The peeps over at double u S B are gonna be all over that this week and next week. This upcoming week is going to have a MASSIVE gamma ramp which could lead people to exercise their calls so that they can buy more shares just to continue DRSing those shares. 

Let me give you some idea of how crazy this could be. Somebody like me, a broke college student, bought a call for $150 just to watch it climb even while the stock was continuing to fall. I feel like I‚Äôm living proof that the gambling community will jump on this like hot cakes. 

This is it. I really think this is it. Now if I had a nickel for every time some person posted something like this on this sub I don‚Äôt think I would need GME to be wealthy, but this massive drop on fear and desperation just goes to show that this may be their final stand. Only time can tell if I‚Äôm wrong, but I give it a month or less before we explode.

Does 50-day/200-day simple moving average (golden cross/death cross) outperform naive dollar-cost-average / buy-and-hold? 1993 -&gt; 2022,"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deathcross.asp

&gt; The ""death cross"" is a market chart pattern reflecting recent price weakness. It refers to the drop of a short-term moving average‚Äîmeaning the average of recent closing prices for a stock, stock index, commodity or cryptocurrency over a set period of time‚Äîbelow a longer-term moving average. The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldencross.asp

&gt; A golden cross is a chart pattern in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average (such as the 15-day moving average) breaking above its long-term moving average (such as the 50-day moving average) or resistance level. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes.

We are currently in a ""death cross"" state.

**Outline**

Private-label supplements are gaining popularity, and they have built a reputation for being a savior for start-ups and making a profitable business. Private labels can help you grow your supplements business, whether big or small.

**Private label supplements**

[**Private label supplements**](https://www.akums.in/) are the most vital medium to outshine an established supplements manufacturer. If you are going for custom supplements, your brand stands out from the rest. This may be proven as a great incentive that can draw people towards private labeling, on the other hand, to enhance your profit margins.¬†

Certain essential supplements always remain in demand and are used by consumers regularly; this feature makes the supplements such a profitable business. If one supplement suits your customers, they will pick up others too from the same brand. Expanding your business to capitalize is not a problem when you prepare custom supplements with the unique formula given by private labeling.

**The ways to outgrow your business with Private Label**¬†

* One of the most significant barriers to the growth of the supplement business is the cost. The capacity of production, equipment, infrastructure, and ingredients to prepare an authentic brand requires a lot of investments; however, private label supplements are much less expensive and risky, which is why they are highly appreciated. They even accept much lower order quantity, meaning less buying and spending
* The risk level is relatively low as they have the sure shot formula, which proves successful. Along with this, the scalability of products helps you to cut short the demand of any product at any time, which further helps you to reduce the possibility of loss.
* ¬†Bringing something new can be exciting, but essential supplements that fit your niche are also necessary. These fundamental supplements can retain clientele coming back each month. Private label supplements fill in the background nicely without you having to spend as much money.¬†
* As private label supplements are not as costly, expansion is easier; moreover, they're easy to get in stock hastily. Spin-around time for private label supplements can be a few days. Private Label can help you to bring any new trend of supplements promptly. The supplement industry is very swift-moving, and the pace can be matched if you work with world-class [**pharma contract manufacturers**](https://www.akums.in/)¬†to move on trends faster than your competition.¬†

**Akums Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd.: The Ultimate**¬†

[**Akums Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd.**](https://www.akums.in/) follows trends closely and develops private label formulas so that the associates can be some of the first in the industry to offer a new product. Akums is one of the renowned private label brands established in the market due to its quality, assurance, and innovation. Looking for something new and a firm grip over existence, what makes Akums the ultimate brand to look up for private supplements? Having the latest supplements on board will help you to attract new clients and strengthen existing ones.¬†

**Key Takeaways**

#‚ñåMain stories covered:

&gt;- **[NEWS]     BSP raises policy rate by 50 basis points...** The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) [[source](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/business/2022/9/22/BSP-monetary-policy-meeting-September-22.html)], our central bank and rough equivalent of the US Federal Reserve (US Fed), met yesterday and decided to raise the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 4.25%. This rate is used by banks to set the price for renting money (loan interest rates), and should (in theory) impact everything from savings deposit rates to mortgage rates.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** *The BSP might be aggressive relative to its own history, but this the second meeting cycle in a row where the US Fed came out with a strong raise and the BSP failed to keep pace. The peso has melted in value relative to the US Dollar, in part because of this difference, and it will (probably?) continue to melt because of the BSP‚Äôs approach. The US Fed basically signaled that the 75 bp raises will continue until inflation looks controllable, but the BSP seems far less guided by any clear metric. Peso weakness will probably get worse before it gets better.*

&gt;- **[META]     Adjustment to the calculation of Citicore Energy REIT‚Äôs estimated yield...** Citicore Energy REIT [CREIT 2.26 ‚ñº1.74%] is unique in that it generates a regular, quarterly dividend from the lease revenue that it earns from its properties, and it also generates an annual special dividend from the variable profit-sharing clause in its lease contracts that gives CREIT shareholders a small percentage cut of certain energy selling profits. CREIT provided estimates for both the regular quarterly lease dividends and the special annual profit-sharing dividend, but up until today, my REIT Tracker had only considered the regular quarterly lease dividends when trying to estimate CREIT‚Äôs forward-looking yield. I‚Äôd originally excluded the special dividends categorically, as special dividends are usually reserved for situations that are unforeseen, or hard to predict, and I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable baking any kind of prediction into the yield estimation. On reflection, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what is going on here. I contacted CREIT, and they confirmed that the variable revenues were still tracking according to the predictions in the prospectus. I still think it‚Äôs more speculative than I‚Äôm comfortable doing to include the special dividend into the calculation, but I think it‚Äôs also an inaccurate picture of what the CREIT model offers to ignore it.
&gt;    - ***MB:*** *I am choosing a ‚Äútrust but verify‚Äù approach to improve the accuracy of the MB REIT Tracker. The whole purpose of the tracker is to give readers a better sense of the relative cost/benefit of one REIT compared to another, and considering that the forward-looking yield estimate is itself somewhat speculative (extrapolating the last dividend out into the future), it doesn‚Äôt feel like doing this with CREIT‚Äôs prospectus data is that far outside of what I‚Äôm already doing. For now, I‚Äôm taking the FY22 variable income, chopping that into quarters, dividing that by outstanding shares, and adding that to the dividend before annualizing for the estimated yield. While CREIT predicts the variable income to increase in 2023, I‚Äôm not applying 2023 estimated variable income to the quarters in 2023 that form part of the estimate just yet. All of the additions are based on the lower 2022 estimate from the prospectus. For transparency, I will always include a note in the REIT Tracker to keep everyone aware of how I‚Äôm calculating CREIT‚Äôs dividend, just so we‚Äôre all on the same page.*

&gt;- **[NOTES]     Quick takes from around the market...**
&gt;    - **Bank of Commerce** [BNCOM 9.11 ‚ñº4.11%] [[source](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=825fe64f45de3bb83470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that 879 million shares held by subsidiaries of San Miguel [SMC 97.65 ‚ñº0.36%] will come out of mandatory lockup on the night of September 27, and will be available for active trading on the morning of September 28. 
&gt;        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *BNCOM has staged a significant price recovery after a really dark post-IPO period where its price dropped to P8.00/share. That said, I don‚Äôt think SMC is the kind of company that is likely to drip-sell BNCOM shares on the open market for a little bit of quick liquidity. I mean, I‚Äôm still going to watch that morning to make sure, but it‚Äôs just not really the way they do it. Bonds and prefs, though? All day long.*
&gt;    - **Citicore Energy REIT** [CREIT 2.26 ‚ñº1.74%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=083108ceb77cef763470cea4b051ca8f)] board approved issuance of ‚Ç±4.5 billion in unsecured fixed rate ASEAN green bonds. ‚Ç±3 billion of that amount will be the """"base"""" amount, with up to ‚Ç±1.5 billion in additional bonds available through an oversubscription option. 
&gt;        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *This amount would maximize CREIT's available debt quota under the REIT Law, which forms the majority of its current P6.5 billion in """"buying power"""" (a proprietary REIT stat that I calculate and track that represents the amount of value that a REIT could acquire using a combination of available debt and equity up to the minimum public ownership threshold). Maybe the thinking is to sell the bonds now, at a time when rates look like they'll be the cheapest that they'll be before maybe like 2024, and use that cash to download additional assets from CREIT's sponsor/parent to expand capacity. I'm curious to see what kind of rates they'll need to give in order to sell the bonds, though.*
&gt;    - **Solar Philippines** [SPNEC 1.24 ‚ñº1.59%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=b69c97150adfcea63470cea4b051ca8f)] disclosed that its owner, Leandro Leviste, bought 10 million shares on Wednesday for around ‚Ç±1.27/share. The purchases were done through a private company that Mr. Leviste owns, called Countryside Investments Holdings Corporation, which now holds 310 million SPNEC shares representing 3.1% of SPNEC‚Äôs outstanding shares. 
&gt;        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *SPNEC has been in free-fall since around the time of its stock rights offering offer period. Is Mr. Leviste picking up some more of his own supply on the cheap, or is he trying to buy some peace of mind for SPNEC investors who have become increasingly vocal about SPNEC‚Äôs poor stock price performance?
&gt;    - **Converge** [CNVRG 14.92 ‚ñº11.30%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=55af09144cb41ef33470cea4b051ca8f)] announced a stock buy-back program with a budget of ‚Ç±1.5 billion, which was approved by the board on September 22. CNVRG said that the buy-back was intended to ‚Äúdemonstrate confidence in the Company‚Äôs fundamental value‚Äù. The stock is down 62% over the past 12 months.*
&gt;        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Soon after that October 2021 high is when things started going off the rails for CNVRG‚Äôs stock price. CNVRG‚Äôs American partner, Coherent Cloud, hastily dumped 5.6% of CNVRG‚Äôs outstanding shares in a block sale that seemed to shock the market and catch CNVRG flat-footed. CNVRG tried to make lemonade by soaking up Coherent Cloud‚Äôs follow-up sale in May, but all the positive spin couldn‚Äôt mask the haste of Coherent Cloud‚Äôs exit. New subscriber growth has slowed (it‚Äôs still going up, but the rate of that increase is decreasing), and now there are whispers around town (echoed by [COL‚Äôs April Tan](https://twitter.com/AprilLeeTan/status/1572798345902723072))  that CNVRG may be removed from the MSCI Index in November. Does this buy-back program stop the bleeding? Hard to say. CNVRG does an average of ‚Ç±188 million in value traded each day, so this plan represents only about eight full days of trading volume. That said, judicious application of a buy-back can have an outsized impact on price, as we saw earlier this year with DoubleDragon [DD 6.98 ‚ñº0.43%]. We‚Äôll have to wait and see.*
&gt;    - **Synergy Grid** [SGP 12.10 ‚ñº0.17%] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=e453535c781dea853470cea4b051ca8f)] declared a Q3 cash dividend of ‚Ç±0.26/share, payable on October 19 to shareholders of record as of October 5. 
&gt;        - ***MB Quick Take:*** *These dividends are what have been consumed and excreted through the various segments of the corporate centipede that the company‚Äôs owners used to attempt to satisfy the public listing requirements of their nation-wide power transmission franchise. Using SGP‚Äôs Thursday closing price of ‚Ç±12.10/share, this dividend represents an annualized (estimated) yield of 8.59%. That‚Äôs a decent return. Especially for people who bought SGP at ~‚Ç±11.30/share (9.20% estimated yield) back in March. Less so for people who bought it two weeks ago for ~‚Ç±13.80/share (7.49% estimated yield).*

11 Best Skills To Learn To Make Money Online," The internet economy is rapidly growing and, in 2020, it generated 17 million jobs in the U.S. The takeaway for consumers? You can do pretty much anything online --¬†including making money -- whether you do so as a side hustle or as a full-time job.

But does one begin when looking to make money online? The same place they'd need to start with a ""real-world"" job: with a confident attitude, smart negotiation tactics and a set of sharply honed skills. And what sort of skills, exactly? Plenty of what you need IRL may apply, but if you're looking to venture into a new business or dive into freelancing, you should diversify and augment your skill set.

Here are 11 of the best skills you should learn in order to make money online.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img j6uozoqphlp91...*

**Web Development**

""I think the best skill to learn to make money online is web development,"" said Michael Liam Miller, editor, content improver and fact-checker with Luxury Cars A2Z. ""Because it is in high demand and there are many different ways to monetize your skills. You can learn web development through online courses, boot camps, or even self-study. And, if you're good at it, you can potentially earn a lot of money; freelance rates for web developers range from $50-$100 per hour, and some full-time developers make over $100,000 per year.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Adobe Illustrator**

""I believe learning Adobe Illustrator for graphic design work is a great way to start to earn money online,"" said Bill Zimmerman, the CEO of Spotlightr. ""This is useful because literally anyone that runs a website or builds their own site, or does anything online like advertising, Youtube videos, etc, at one point needs some design work done. And this is not a skill you can just pick up in a few days. It does take some dedication but it's easily achieved.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Photography**

""You can find numerous free online courses and youtube videos to help you develop this skill,"" said Kevin Mercier, an entrepreneur and professional photographer at kevmrc.Com. ""You can use these courses to learn about light, exposure, color, tone and timing. This will help you produce more creative, interesting, and noticeable photographs. You can sell almost any type of photo online, from street photography to pictures of food and animals. I recommend trying Alamy first to begin selling your stock photos. On average, photos on Alamy sell for around $75 each but could get anywhere from $17-$416, depending on what they are used for.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Audio Editing for Podcasts**

""Podcasts have evolved from being a niche phenomenon for tech-savvy people to a popular phenomenon worth tens of millions of dollars,"" said Matthew Dailly, managing director at Tiger Financial. ""Many people have expressed a desire to start their own podcasts as a result of that money; however, the majority of people lack the knowledge necessary to edit audio on their own, which is why you come in. You can take someone else's audio and polish it up so that their listeners won't leave them critical comments. The fact that podcast listeners frequently express dissatisfaction with the sound quality means that there will always be a need for your services.""

**Voice Modulation**

""Voice Modulation skills are one of the most rewarding skills that can be learned to make money online,"" said Layla Acharya, the owner of EdWize. ""Some of the untapped markets that need exploring are voice-over artists, narrators, etc. Voice-over artists are needed for recording audiobooks, story narration, videos, etc. There are many jobs available on online portals that particularly ask for this skill.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Virtual Assisting**

""An ideal candidate for the position of virtual assistant would be task-oriented, proficient in data entry and social media management, and have a get-things-done mentality,"" said Carl Jensen, founder of Compare Banks. ""You may make $25 to $100 per hour with the proper education and skill set.""

**Social Media Marketing**

""As a social media marketer, planning and managing a brand's social media strategy across several channels will be your responsibility,"" Jensen said. ""As more and more users engage in social media platforms, any business that fails to take advantage of social media's power will miss out on brand-building chances. Due to this, social media marketing is becoming more and more popular. This could be an excellent skill to learn if you are familiar with the specifics of how social media functions.""

**Affiliate Marketing**

""Affiliate marketing is a useful skill because it allows you to monetize your website or blog traffic,"" said Drew Mann, founder of Drew's Review. ""If you have a website or blog with a large audience, affiliate marketing can be a great way to generate revenue from that traffic. Additionally, affiliate marketing is useful because it allows you to promote products and services that you believe in and use yourself. This builds trust with your audience and can help increase sales of the products or services that you promote.""

Mann added that the amount of money you can make with affiliate marketing varies depending on the program you choose, the products you promote and the amount of traffic you can generate; ""however, some affiliate marketers earn thousands of dollars per month.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Merch by Amazon**

""If you have a knack for freelance graphic design and illustrations, Merch by Amazon could be the perfect fit for you,"" said Joshua Rich,¬†CEO and founder of Bullseye Locations. ""You can easily design merchandise like hoodies, T-shirts, and pop-sockets and leave it to Amazon to print and deliver the orders. This can potentially help you earn 4-500 dollars in a matter of months.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Amazon Self-Publishing**

""This is one of Amazon's print-on-demand services,"" Rich said. ""All you need to do is get your hands on a few market research tools, conduct your research, and plan the right product. Free online tutorials can help you extensively throughout the process, and you can hire freelancers to write, edit and proofread the self-published book. Amazon itself will take care of the printing and delivery process and you can easily earn up to a thousand dollars within a few months.""

&amp;#x200B;

**Freelance Consulting**

""Lastly, if you have considerable experience in any kind of business, you can provide an online consultation service on freelancing platforms, given the field is relevant to your area of expertise,"" Rich said.",money_online_fast,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/money_online_fast/comments/xlv66o/11_best_skills_to_learn_to_make_money_online/,,SamyCom,xlv66o,/r/money_online_fast/comments/xlv66o/11_best_skills_to_learn_to_make_money_online/,https://www.reddit.com/r/money_online_fast/comments/xlv66o/11_best_skills_to_learn_to_make_money_online/,0,2022-09-23
What Is A Cyclical Stock?,"There are many differences between preferred and common stock. 

The main difference is that **preferred stock usually does not give shareholders voting rights**, while common stock does, usually at one vote per share owned. 

This lack of voting right is compensated by the fact that preferred shareholders have priority over a company's income, meaning they are paid dividends before common shareholders.

**Common stockholders are last in line when it comes to company assets**, which means they will be paid out after creditors, bondholders, and preferred shareholders. Both of these stocks can be traded over public exchanges.

The Four Pillars of Successful Trading," 

Trading in financial markets can be extremely rewarding, but it‚Äôs not as easy as many people would have you believe. Being a great trader requires time, work, expertise, and discipline; it doesn't just include getting started and then steadily increasing your earnings until you're drinking champagne on your private yacht. In reality, prior to investing in the markets, it is important to comprehend the following four areas:

1. **Fundamental analysis**
2. **Technical analysis**
3. **Trading psychology**
4. **Risk management**

**Traders may decide to place more emphasis on charts and technical analysis or on fundamental news, but in my experience, combining the two is the ideal strategy for making wise trading decisions.**

**Any effective trader must be able to maintain emotional control in any circumstance and consistently manage their risk at all times, regardless of the sort of analysis they use.**

**Fundamental analysis:**

Fundamental research can take many different forms, including price/earnings ratios, corporate balance sheets, macroeconomic statistics, and headline news. However, macroeconomic data is what most traders find to be crucial. Government agencies all throughout the world periodically make Tier 1 macro data announcements, including information on interest rates, the GDP, inflation, and employment. In addition to causing quick, short-term changes, this data may also provide a longer-term picture of the state of the economy in a given nation if you add up a number of monthly numbers.

This in turn will offer prospective guidance for the country's currency, bond market, and the stock market. It's critical for short-term traders, who may hold positions for a few minutes to a few days, to be aware of the macroeconomic data that will be provided each day and the potential market repercussions in advance. There are a lot of free economic calendars online, but be mindful that it can be too late by the time the data updates show up.

**Technical analysis:**

Charts, in my opinion, are the most accurate representation of market emotion because they show prices as they are exchanged and price fluctuations that take into account both fundamental news and the hopes and anxieties of investors and traders. Anyone may look at charts, but proper chart analysis requires talent and focus. While most traders concentrate on main indicators found directly on the chart, such as support, resistance, trends, and price patterns, some adopt a more sophisticated strategy and include technical indicators like oscillators, moving averages, or other studies based on formulae. You should develop a disciplined and reliable trading strategy and make sure you always go by a set of predetermined guidelines, particularly when your heart is urging you to ""go for the big one.""

**Trading psychology:**

The most crucial element of trading is this, and it is also the main cause of many traders' failures. When trading, it's crucial to remain composed both during prosperous periods and difficult ones. In fact, it's sometimes the most difficult thing to accomplish to maintain control when retaining a winning position. Living in a social environment teaches us how to act, yet while trading, we frequently need to act differently. We just try to be scared when others are greedy, and greedy only when others are fearful, to take a great statement from Warren Buffett.

**Risk management:**

The ability to preserve capital is yet another crucial component of effective trading. You must set and adhere to your risk limits both for your entire portfolio and for each individual transaction in order to avoid having to cease trading if you run out of money.

For instance, keeping any losses within control requires risking 1% of your equity on every transaction, 2% per day, and 4% per week. If your losses reach one of these thresholds, you should halt trading for the day or the week, as appropriate. These are laws, not recommendations, and they must always be followed. The percentage returns needed to recover your losses will rise exponentially if you allow losses to exceed certain boundaries; this will build psychological strain, which may lead to more losses. Prevention is better than cure, so fix your risk limits and stick to them... always!

High goodwill balance and its impact on the share price,"Just struggling to get my head around it.

The school asked to conduct the literature review, but I am probably the dumbest person, because I cannot find the proper articles using key words like ""value relevance goodwill"" or ""goodwill impact on stock"".

A lot of articles only talk about goodwill impairment and its effect on the stock price, but nothing about goodwill high balance and its effect on the market value. 

Anyway, if someone could give some insight or think about more key words for the search? If you somehow can find the article with the goodwill regression analysis and its impact on the share price, I would honestly pay you. I definitely do not expect anyone to help me writing the assignment, just wanted fresh perspective.

"This will ruin your life. Even at 20, rant.","

I feel so stupid! I damn near lost everything with this bullshit and im glad I now caught it. I couldnt sleep thinking about if i lost my money or trade went right or went wrong. Almost lost my girlfriend and friends in the process. Damn near almost fucked my grades this college semester because of day trading! Couldn't focus at my job because I'm glued to the damn phone worried about the next move. The PDT rule got on my fucking nerves. Brokerages pissed me tf with how slow they Are! The panic of not knowing whether the fuck the stock will tank by 20% in the next second or not. Its not even about me losing my money, its about me almost falling into the day trader LIFE. 
Thank God im getting out this hell hole

I guess this is really not for me. I dont know how yall do it, but this is the most draining, mental health damaging thing ever. I've used technical analysis, I've watched the news, I've done everything even though I've asked for additional help and its still wrong! Drew trend lines, Used the RSI, other bs indicators and I've only won big on 6 trades but lost big on 9. Studied hours and hours to try and get it right. Maybe its just not for me. I bet tons of other people can relate. I bought books, connected with others, so much time and dedication and this bullshit did what it did best, take your money. THERE COULD BE A LITERAL ALIEN INVASION AND THE STOCK WILL FLY UP BY 5000%.

Ig a 9-5 isn't that bad as it seems, as this is the only reason why I came to trading in the first place. 20 years old, social media destroyed me and made it seem like imma be some ""NPC"" or in the ""Rat Race"" but yet the stock market destroyed me more than anything! They say have discipline and you have to learn the hard way. I agreed and yes I lost thousands and still worked on myself. Maybe I'm the king of bad luck, idk, idc.

Here is your zen,"What are they going to do? Price it lower than bankruptcy?

Earnings are next week 9/29. Stock will probably bottom then. That is your signal to buy. If you want in before, by all means. Last earnings was 6.50 and dropped to 5.50 because they missed their earnings per share by over 100%. I'm not sure if it will be as bad this time, but who knows. Point is we're currently at that same price and that was with bankruptcy on the table.

Advise: Be Wary of Uncertainty and Biases,"I feel like this reddit is filled with predictions but there is rarely a mention of risk, uncertainty and biases. Comparing this with professional quants, the most important thing is usually a quantification of uncertainties, whereas expected return is of often secondary importance. I hope this thread will help some newer investor think about stocks.

What do I mean by that? Say you agree with a lot of threads here saying stocks will keep falling, and now it's not a good time to buy. What's wrong with just waiting now?

The question is, how sure are you? If it's 100%, then logically you should sell as many call options (or buy puts) as possible that expires exactly when you predict stock will go up, then reverse. The reason you are not doing that is because you are not 100% certain, nobody is. So what's this uncertainty? You need to estimate that. If it's 10%, it means that there is a 10% chance stock will go up. What will you do then? Will you be willing to buy at a higher price? What if that higher price is a bull trap? How will you decide to sell/buy again and again? If you have not considered the possibilities that you are wrong, and you do not have a plan in place to buy/sell back in if your predictions are wrong, then by definition, YOU ARE TRADING WITH EMOTIONS. This is bad, because you might luck out and get it right this time, but long term trends suggest that you will lose out. Unless of course, you are perfectly fine with not participating in the stock market.

&amp;#x200B;

On the flip side, if you are committed to buying individual stocks, make sure you also understand there's a possibility that you are wrong. That your stock may fall by 50% or more. It could fall hard and then back up again, or it could shoot high and come crashing down. These are possibilities that you need to be okay with, and you need to plan what you'd do before making the buy decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, coming back to topic of DCA into broad market funds and why it works. It's because it's emotionless and it covers all cases -- whether you are right or wrong. If stock goes down, you buy more shares, so you don't miss out. If stock goes up, you keep accumulating and obviously your shares go up. This strategy doesn't get the highest possible yield, but it gives you the highest risk-adjusted yield, meaning that in the average aggregate of most scenarios you'll come out ahead -- and believe me, the stock market has all sorts of scenarios. Of course, you still need to be okay with losing all of your money, because apocalypse might come, but at least you can sleep well knowing that you have covered all the possible uncertain outcomes.",stocks,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xm4zfj/advise_be_wary_of_uncertainty_and_biases/,,galacticbyte,xm4zfj,/r/stocks/comments/xm4zfj/advise_be_wary_of_uncertainty_and_biases/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xm4zfj/advise_be_wary_of_uncertainty_and_biases/,0,2022-09-23

Said it before and will say it again FTX is SKETCH,"It doesn't take much critical thinking for the red flags to wave. The r/superstonk interview was clearly a promotional event for FTX and they sidestepped essentially ALL the important questions the AMA list wanted explicit clarification on. 

IMO, not covering the RobbingDaHood questions in detail was a huge mistake, mods. You needed to show your spine, and you didn't. You did not do a good job on this one. FTX steamrolled you. 

IMO, the way they answered questions about L2 show that FTX wants to usurp Loopring/IMX as the 'preferred' partners. Which, they are not, because Loopring is a non-custodial DEX. IMX is building games. FTX is CEX and CEX is for dummies

IMO, the way they evasively answered ""not your keys - not your crypto""   was just another pitch for CEX.

IMO, the way they answered tokenized stocks was evasive. Notice how he never clarified that the gme token they sell is NOT a stock?  tokenized security to a cold wallet? that's just not how shit works. they want to hold your assets. done and done. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jane Street boys, ex Citadel?     Notice the difference between how FTX team interacts with the sub vs Dave Lauer?  both are ex cit, but one is a snake in the grass, and the other started a transparent market reform lobbyist group.

Mods, you need to press guests to answer the questions people upvote. Not what you want. If you wont do that, don't do anymore AMA's.

Barrons: Could This Be Another ‚ÄòLost Decade‚Äô for the Stock Market?,"it‚Äôs impossible to overstate just how good stock market returns have been for investors over the last 40 years‚Äîand for even longer. From the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs SPX ‚Äì1.72%  low of 102.20 in 1982 through its peak of 4818.62 in January 2022, the index returned 12.9% annually including reinvested dividends. That‚Äôs slightly above the average of 11.8% going back to 1928.

But the stock market goes through ‚Äúlost decades,‚Äù periods where returns are hard to come by. The most recent occurred from the dot-com peak in 2000 through 2013, when the stock market finally broke out in a meaningful way. Before that, the stock market remained mired in a decade-plus trading range from 1968 through 1982, when the S&amp;P 500 returned just 4% annualized including reinvested dividends.

Albert Edwards has been singing the same tune for a long time about the end of what he calls the ‚ÄúIce Age,‚Äù a period of ‚Äúsecular stagnation‚Äù that left yields low and boosted asset prices. But now, he looks like he may be right. Instead of printing money and cutting rates to boost the economy, central banks will now have to deal with governments that seem more willing to spend than ever, bringing ‚Äúhigher growth, higher inflation, and higher interest rates across the curve,

If Edwards is correct, it will come as a shock to investors who are used to stocks going up most of the time, and a Fed that always had the market‚Äôs back. It will also require more than a simple buy-the-S&amp;P-500-and-hold strategy. Stiefel strategist Barry Bannister has argued that investors will need to be more tactical, buying when the market is weak and selling when it is strong. Dividends, too, will be far more important. It‚Äôs one reason the S&amp;P 500 could lose 5.7% from its 1968 high through its 1982 low and investors could still emerge with a positive return, at least before adjusting for inflation.",stocks,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xmcpgd/barrons_could_this_be_another_lost_decade_for_the/,,VariousTwo9032,xmcpgd,/r/stocks/comments/xmcpgd/barrons_could_this_be_another_lost_decade_for_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xmcpgd/barrons_could_this_be_another_lost_decade_for_the/,0,2022-09-23
$HBI &gt; $BBBY &amp; $HBI &gt; $GME &amp; $HBI &gt; $AMC The underlying business is better &amp; recession-proof. Everyone needs underwear.,"The facts are pretty clear here. The stock market is shit. Even good companies are getting shit on by hedge fund and Hanes Brands Inc ($HBI) is no different.

Even though they pay a strong üí™üèº dividend of 7.6% üíµ &amp; have a very low PE of 7 with solid cash flow &amp; decent leverage of 3.0 ‚Äî the shares are some of the most borrowed by hedge funds to drive into the ground.

$HBI owns the Champion brand which is loved globally and is considered ultra premium in China &amp; Korea. 

Hanes also has been known for its exclusive t-shirt partnership with Michael Jordan &amp; its the inventor of the tag-less tee shirt. 

The business model itself is so attractive that Berkshire Hathaway owns competitor Fruit of the Loom outright. (Buyout target)?

At under $8/share $HBI is a generational buy. Buy it to hold. Buy it for the dividend. Buy it for the short term trade. Buy it to pressure the hedge funds into capitulation.

Have a great weekend everyone.,"End of another disappointing week. That said there are some things happening next week that will hopefully get us going in the right direction. I will also say the negativity around next month‚Äôs shareholders meeting is both disappointing and understandable. It‚Äôs completely reasonable to wonder why DO is spending money like this while we are diluting the shock. Unlike last year DO can‚Äôt just make a bunch of forward looking statements because many people won‚Äôt believe him, he needs to announce actual contracts, revenues, project updates, acquisitions, real concrete things that effect the stock today. I‚Äôm not completely sold that he will do enough of that to make a difference. Just be prepared to buy or at least hold regardless what happens. We have good tech in an emerging market. The Optilian IPO aside, time is the only real factor to when we will all be rewarded for our investment.

Ashamed and embarrassed with how little progress I've made thus far in life. How do I stop putting myself down so much?,"This will probably be long but lately I've been feeling profoundly miserable and depressed. I'm 26, nearing 27 and honestly, I'm ashamed of how little progress I've made in life since graduating college back in 2019. I have a degree in Economics and thought that this would open up many doors for me. It was 100% my own fault, given that I never made any connections, never got any internships or anything. Just general work experience (retail sales, and food), which I suppose is better than nothing, but I wholeheartedly regret how little I actually gave a shit in college. You know in those sitcoms where  someone opens up a door, only to find a brick wall? Yeah...

Anyway, after a year slogging away at the apps, I finally found a job working in QA for a credit card company. There's some fraud analysis and compliance tossed in, but overall it's very mind-numbing, low-paying (I was hired at 11 an hour... it increased to 18 an hour not too long ago..) work. I actually enjoy the job though, to some extent, as I work remotely and it's not terrible... the job is interesting.. but the pay is pathetic and I've been pumping out the applications for a better job now since the start of the year, with no success.

I feel like a pathetic loser. Nearly all of my friends are killing it right now, either with marriages or great jobs, lots of money, etc. Whatever else. I'm still having to live at home and also financially help my mom, because she's broke (that's another story, but yeah..). The only thing I do have going on for me is that I have money in the stock market, and a sizeable nest egg..... but yeah. I just feel incredibly behind in life and despite all of my attempts to gain traction, something inevitable screws me over and sets me back even more. How do I learn to stop putting myself down so much about where I'm at in life? Honestly sounds like I might need therapy, but I don't know yet. I go go the gym almost everyday and it helps, but I still feel like there's a huge chunk missing from my life.",findapath,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/xm7q1m/ashamed_and_embarrassed_with_how_little_progress/,Advice,electric_wizard_666,xm7q1m,/r/findapath/comments/xm7q1m/ashamed_and_embarrassed_with_how_little_progress/,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/xm7q1m/ashamed_and_embarrassed_with_how_little_progress/,0,2022-09-23

REVOLUTION BEAUTY UNAUDITABLE ‚Äì HOW BAD IS THIS FOR BOOHOO?," 

#### Key points:

* REVB announces that BDO won‚Äôt sign off on the accounts
* This doesn‚Äôt reflect well on BOO, which bought into REVB
* Also, long positions in BOO are being built to balance the shorts

Revolution Beauty (LON: REVB) sharea are currently suspended over the non delivery of the audited accounts. The announcement today is that BDO has told REVB that it is, currently, unauditable. The controls and documentation to be able to give a true and fair view just aren‚Äôt there ‚Äì or are not available to the auditors. This is not one of those things considered to be a good sign. But, given that the REVB shares are currently suspended the big interest here is how badly does this reflect upon Boohoo (LON: BOO)? For Boohoo did just take a large position in Revolution Beauty and it doesn‚Äôt seem to have done the homework when it did so. How much more of BOO‚Äôs activities are so slapdash therefore?

The particular problem at Revolution Beauty [is this](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/REVB/further-update-on-the-group-s-audit/15641109):‚ÄùBDO LLP (‚ÄúBDO‚Äù), the Company‚Äôs auditor, has written to the Board and identified a number of serious concerns that have arisen during the course of its work on the FY22 audit regarding, amongst others, the Group‚Äôs ability to provide sufficient and accurate audit evidence in respect of a number of key audit areas and the validity of certain commercial arrangements entered into by the Company. BDO has indicated that, at the present time, it is not able to sign an audit report in respect of the FY22 accounts.‚Äù They are, in their current state, unauditable. This is one of those things which is a really bad sign.

We‚Äôre also told, in the same statement: ‚ÄúThe Company has, however, continued to encounter macro headwinds, including the ongoing impact of the Russia/Ukraine conflict, consumer spending patterns and cost inflation. In light of the above, the Company now expects that its results for FY23 will be materially below market expectations and the previous guidance given.‚Äù Or, as we might put it, stick a fork in it, it‚Äôs toast. 

Given the suspension at REVB there‚Äôs not much we can do about this. But there‚Äôs that Boohoo interest to consider. [BOO invested in Revolution Beauty](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/revolution-beauty-up-16-as-boohoo-buys-in-boo-down-2-why/) and that‚Äôs not turned out well, obviously. Which has hit the [Boohoo share price](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/revolution-beauty-deal-drags-boohoo-down-10-why/).

The question to ask being, well, why did Boohoo buy into a company that can‚Äôt even produce the documentation to get audited? That‚Äôs not showing a great amount of due diligence there now, is it? The specific BOO and REVB deal isn‚Äôt all that important ‚Äì it‚Äôs not that large given the size of Boohoo. But as a signal to how decisions are taken it‚Äôs just not a good look.

[Boohoo is London‚Äôs most shorted stock](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/boohoo-is-londons-most-shorted-stock-should-we-follow/). There are problems within the business as well, but this sort of insouciance with shareholder money could be part of it. On the other hand we‚Äôve seen [Citadel buy in with a 5% long stake](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/boohoo-we-should-go-long-with-citadel-short-with-the-market/). [FIL has just taken a 5%-ish stake in Boohoo too](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/BOO/notification-of-major-holdings/15641119).

So there‚Äôs considerable disagreement in the market as to Boohoo‚Äôs future. Many short, some going long with significant stakes. Our own trading position has to be determined by which way we think this is going to go. But buying into a company which then cannot gain an audit just isn‚Äôt a good look for BOO.",asktraders12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktraders12/comments/xm2u2h/revolution_beauty_unauditable_how_bad_is_this_for/,,Asktraders178,xm2u2h,/r/asktraders12/comments/xm2u2h/revolution_beauty_unauditable_how_bad_is_this_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktraders12/comments/xm2u2h/revolution_beauty_unauditable_how_bad_is_this_for/,0,2022-09-23

BTC is actually outperforming the S&amp;P 500 in this latest stage of the market downturn,"I think it's not a surprise to many anymore when I say that the price action direction of crypto has been very closely in line with the direction of the stock market. With crypto's hyper volatility we have seen far higher gains in the preceding years and higher drops since last November.

However, and this is rather cherry picking dates of course, more recently crypto has actually been the safer investment, and by that I of course mean that it has lost less than the stock markets have.

In the past month BTC has only decreased by about 6.7% which is still a huge loss but when compared to the 'safe' option of the S&amp;P 500 which has tumbled a ridiculous 10.5% it is quite amusing to be in crypto as the safer option!

Of course this doesn't hold up going further back with the 1 year time scale showing the stock markets still being the ones that lost the least.

&amp;#x200B;

With the markets continuing to tumble in the last few days but crypto maintaining a rough price level perhaps we are entering a bottom for crypto having already bleed so much this year.",CryptoCurrency,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xm021c/btc_is_actually_outperforming_the_sp_500_in_this/,DISCUSSION,xavierwest888,xm021c,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xm021c/btc_is_actually_outperforming_the_sp_500_in_this/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xm021c/btc_is_actually_outperforming_the_sp_500_in_this/,0,2022-09-23

Pepperfry looks to file draft IPO papers next quarter!,"Pepperfry, an Omni channel furniture seller, will likely file draft papers with the SEBI next quarter for its proposed IPO. The company aims to list on the stock exchanges next year. It had postponed its IPO plans early this year due to adverse market conditions. The company will take the final call on the matter by November.

"I'm FIREd. Was About to Mow my Lawn, Saw the Market Tumble (further), Bought More Stock","Yep. For those of you not yet FIREd and are dollar cost averaging with automatic investments, the down market REALLY is a good thing because you are getting ""bargain"" stock - especially if you have a longer retirement horizon.  I had this opportunity back in 2008 crash.

But for currently retired people, the downward market can be a bit more scary.  However, despite the temptation of the high flying market from 2020 to 2021,  I maintained a conservative/balanced portfolio.  My cash hedge has allowed me to buy into market downturns and lets me sleep at night. I periodically rebalance. This also helps me to take gains and offload losers.  Though my portfolio has now shifted into mainly Index Funds, I do have some stock that provides generous dividends.

I had set triggers with my brokerage accounts (""good til cancelled' limit orders with really low price target prices @ or below 52 week lows).  I got such a notification (as I was preparing to do yard work) - stopped what I was doing - and began buying/adding to my positions.

I was a very vanilla, moderate FIREr myself.  No special house hacking or incredible real estate scores, no options trading or side gigs, no extreme frugal living, nor crypto downfall.  Just plodded along at work with a high percentage of savings &amp; investing, changed jobs if it wasn't working for me, and enjoyed my life in the moment versus being miserly or obsessed with the future.

Of note, I FIREd @ 53 years old.  I am a Gen-Xer and the thought of retiring at under 40 years of age never dawned on me - or was particularly desireable.",Fire,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/xm0w54/im_fired_was_about_to_mow_my_lawn_saw_the_market/,,BethMLB,xm0w54,/r/Fire/comments/xm0w54/im_fired_was_about_to_mow_my_lawn_saw_the_market/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/xm0w54/im_fired_was_about_to_mow_my_lawn_saw_the_market/,0,2022-09-23

replacement theory,"  

**H. F. Meeske**

**Lilyfang2015@gmail.com**

**Replacement: The Cultural Issue of Our Time**

**Currently there is much smoke and little light concerning what is called replacement. Replacement simply enough means an existing order is modified or extinguished by the arrival of an alternative. The alternative might be the arrival of a new people, religion, language or idea. The replacement might be organized or organic, welcomed or resisted, real or imagined. The agitation over replacement today is an issue of deep concern to the right and denied by the left as racist hysteria. The right sees the experience as manipulated by a conspiracy of capitalists and Jews; the left sees the matter of less concern and part of cultural evolutionary trends.** 

**The main talking points are: What exactly is replacement? Is replacement actually taking place? Is replacement a matter of real concern? Is the existing culture worth defending or conserving? What are legitimate reactions and what are extreme responses?**

**I see no denying that replacement is taking place in the Europe and North America with the arrival of vast numbers of peoples from historically alien ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds. There is no denying we are not the people we were in 1950. Is that a matter of legitimate concern? We must ask ourselves if we believe our traditional culture is worth preserving. If it is, what measures are legitimate steps to preserve it.**

**Replacement has been a real factor in the cultural life of different peoples at different times. The most obvious replacement to Americans must be the fate of Native Americans encountered by Europeans with the arrival of Columbus. Good or Evil? The response depends on the person asked! Anyone who denies the impact of replacement might ask any Native American concerning the subject.** 

**Replacement is nothing new: Much of history concerns replacement elements. It has been an issue since the Homo Sapiens replaced Neandertals. The first people to settle down and establish settlements soon found strangers moving in on them. The Arian invaders conquered the Indian sub-continent. The Biblical Hebrews invaded and took the Canaanites‚Äô homeland. The late period of the Roman Empire saw a policy that brought in ‚Äòbarbarians‚Äô to serve as mercenary soldiers to guard the empire‚Äôs western frontiers. Over time later recruits brought in wives and families. Eventually these families introduced an influx of related migrating peoples. As the central power of the Western Empire crumbled these new peoples seized control in Gaul, Spain and eventually even the Roaman homeland in Italy.**  

**A specific example is when the Roman military left Britain in 410 AD and abandoned the British-Roman population to the invasions of Angles, Saxons, Picts and Danes. Folk history records the rise of Arthur ‚Äì knight, king or general - who struggled to fight off the Anglo-Saxons hordes that invaded Britain. Replacement of native-born peoples was a major part of British history for five hundred years and only culminated after the failure of the final Viking invasion was succeeded by the Norman conquest in 1066.** 

**Were these events ‚Äòconspiracies‚Äô? No. These replacements were examples social** **movements.**  **German writers have identified this as** ***Kulturkampf*****. A struggle between different ways of life sometimes intellectually over cultural values and sometimes physically over territory. Initially, as defined by Wikipedia,** ***kulturkampf*** **was the term employed to describe the 19th century conflict between Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck and the Roman Catholic Church led by Pope Pius IX over education and ecclesiastical appointments in Germany. Usage of the term generally applies to the clash between competing cultures and frequently has been used to describe the success of European colonials with guns versus native peoples with spears.** 

**We have entered a period of intellectual and emotional turmoil enabled by computerized media, The beast feeds into the traditional American fear and hostility toward the arrival of new people and professional expertise. Americans have always viewed experts with suspicion and the web has brought an instant legitimacy to anyone with a computer posing as a conspiracy buster. Once the webs‚Äô ability to disrupt responsible discourse was recognized agitators abandoned their soap boxes to unleash a perfect storm of electronic ranting and raving over real and imagined issues weaponizing the web‚Äôs darkest potential to mass market false news and spread inane fantasy conspiracies. The current outflow of rant and rave encompasses a plethora of hot button issues and the rejection of all rational discourse undermines the very basis of a functioning democracy. Some aspects of the bombast** **are borrowed, some things are de jour new and a great many are rerun, tried and tested old venom. However, amidst all the raving bits some pieces actually have a legitimate basis.**

#     One of the revivals of political pandering concerning ‚Äòreplacement‚Äô is now made to sound new and scholarly as ‚ÄúReplacement Theory‚Äù confirms Harry Truman‚Äôs observation: ‚ÄúThere is nothing new in the world except the history you do not know.‚Äù Attributing events to conspiracies appeals to those seeking instant answers to knotty issues. In fact fears of replacement are neither new nor without foundation. In its current manifestation ‚Äòreplacement‚Äô is a refashioned version of an old racist conspiracy rant. It claims a born again modern intellectual heritage based on French writings by would be brainchildren Maurice Barre and Renaud Camus pitched as some great new insight. 

**The crux of the current hysteria is that there exists a great global conspiracy by Jews (who else?)** **to replace white Christian voters with aliens. The appeal of this is focused on two deeply rooted American traditions: anti-intellectualism and antisemitism. Like most conspiracy theories it contains lots of paranoid babble and a smattering of a few facts. The general public love conspiracies because they make complex issues appear to be the sinister plotting by a feared minority.** **It is the same as blaming the Jews for the bubonic plague and poisoning the wells in the 14th century. Economics, environmental changes, pandemics and cultural trends are among the many factors influencing events that are complex and convoluted and require broad research to comprehend. As Joeseph Goebbels showed a screamed slogan frequently repeated is easier to sell than complex nuanced facts. Conspiracy buffs have turned replacement into a hot button political issue that liberal naysayers frantically attempt to deny but cannot refute. The rub undermining liberal objections is that various replacements are documented historic fact. The talking heads have latched on to dirty laundry related to a legitimate phenomenon with a long historical paper trail that calls for sober investigation.** 

**In the history of the Western Hemisphere replacement was the fate of indigenous Americans following centuries of war and colonization by European settlers. America was built during the first three centuries of exploration and settlement in a well recorded history of massive replacement. The indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere were in fact one of the greatest victims of recorded replacement: their culture repressed, their traditional lifestyles ended, their homelands expropriated. It was not the action of a ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äô. It was openly proclaimed ‚ÄúManifest Destiny‚Äù that was based on a culture clash between people competing for the same land. The technically more sophisticated people won. Earlier Viking contacts with America failed because the technological differences were minimal and the native population more numerous. Starting from the earliest days following the voyages of Columbus a double cultural replacement was undertaken by the technically advantaged Spanish in the Caribbean Islands.** **The Catholic Church sent priests to convert the natives making them docile believers who worked for their new Spanish masters. When the native islanders were worked to death or succumbed to disease Bartolom√© de las Casas a 16th-century** ***Spanish*** **landowner, friar, priest, and** ***bishop*****,** ***advocated*** **the use of**  ***African*** **replacements to serve in mines and on plantations to save the indigenous population from extinction. The European colonizers also transported white prisoners and indentured individuals as needed to serve as short term enforced labor.** 

**Replacement not only affected indigenous peoples by Europeans. I encountered a little acknowledged example of culture clash while writing about the Dutch settlement of New Netherland. The original Dutch colony claimed the territory between the Connecticut and Delaware rivers.** **In the mid-seventeenth century the English encroached first in Connecticut and later in Pennsylvania driving the Dutch to concentrate on the Hudson River valley. Finally, the English seized the heart of the Dutch settlement in 1664 when they took over the Hudson Valley. The Dutch government was replaced by English, the Dutch language relegated to hearthside and church service, and Dutch culture was first marginalized and gradually obliterated. The takeover was in fact quite lacking in violence and the Dutch settlers were granted great tolerance by the English, but the Dutch were no longer masters in their own settlements.** 

**In 1745 after the failure of the second attempt by the Stuarts to regain the English throne the Scots clans were broken. Kilts, tartans, and bagpipes were outlawed and the highlands culture repressed and replaced for a hundred years. The nineteenth century began with United Staes government mass expulsion of Amerindians from Florida, Georgia and the Gulf region to Oklahoma. By the end of the Indian wars in the United States native peoples were replaced: confined in reservations, their children taught Anglo-American culture and language in schools and the people denied their traditional way of life.** 

**Americans have always had mixed emotions regarding later immigrants of non-Anglo stock. Despite the story book tales of the colonists seeking religious freedom many religionists came to control others religious practices.** **The Constitutional mention of religion is focused upon preventing religious fanatics from establishing a clerical theocracy as had existed in New England in the seventeenth century. While some colonists did seek religious haven the majority sought free land and self-government. Many settlers in the English colonies were transported convicted felons or delinquent street children rounded up and shipped off to a howling wilderness dumping ground. This heritage made many Americans distrustful of government and wary of newcomers of dubious heritage. After the war for independence the Americas were no longer available as a prison for banished minor criminals too expensive to keep incarcerated and not offensive enough to hang. Australia became the chosen land for British felons which explains some cultural similarities shared by the two nations.**

**People other than the original English settlers later joined the colonial migrants. The original settlers of the thirteen colonies were English, Scots, Protestant Northern Irish. There was also a generous measure of Germans who settled in New York and Pennsylvania as the English Georgian monarchs were originally from Hanover. English royals spoke German and chose brides from Protestant German princesses until World War One.** **Nevertheless, while Germans were kinsmen of the British and a comprised a significant portion of the population they were frequently viewed as a bit suspect as ‚ÄúHessian‚Äù aliens. Once America was an independent nation the newest immigrants continued to arrive from the traditional British Isles as well as from northern European Protestant sources: Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. The first replacement alarm came with the potato famine in the 1840s with an influx of poor Irish Roman Catholics. They were accepted as useful digging canals and later took a major role building the railroads west. Many Irish who had fled ruinous conditions of rural life in Ireland remained urban; they were suspect and marginalized carrying the double stigma of having supported the Confederacy and being Roman Catholics., It was not until the 1960s when John Kennedy was elected president that the Irish were finally confidently mainlined. The 1840s and 1850s saw an increased influx of Germans related to the political turmoil surrounding the failed revolutions of 1848. Those Germans were welcomed as fellow Protestant Northern Europeans. They were anti-slavery, supported the Union in the Civil War and many were skilled or wealthy or at least educated and not indigent. Among those Germans were the first wave of Jews. Generally, the first German Jews were not numerous but they were educated, affluent, willing to adapt and maintained a relatively low profile. With the gold rush of the 1850s and the first arrival of Chinese in America there was some early ‚Äúyellow peril‚Äù rumblings. However, many of the Chinese were contracted railroad workers who were male, lived apart and had limited contact with the white population. They also had a remarkable system of cultural support from Chinese contractors further limiting cultural clashes. Then in the late Nineteenth century focused replacement concerns were expressed as waves of immigrants arrived from Italy and Russia. Nativist fears and concerns were addressed at different times by the Know Nothings, various isolationists and following the Civil War well into the 1920s by the KKK. Eventually, the needs for industrial workers and settlers as the nation grew prevailed and eventually many new people were assimilated.** 

**The native response was innovative and vigorous. It was called the ‚ÄúMelting Pot‚Äù approach to Americanizing the literally millions of alien immigrants arriving each year. It was the means by which a vast variety of peoples, cultures and individuals were assimilated into a cohesive whole. Newcomers were schooled in American English, they were taught about the country, popular customs and a give a large dose of nineteenth century flag waving nationalism. No ‚Äúdial two‚Äù for English, no government forms and paperwork in dozens of languages, no English as a second language. Learn English and adapt. Sink or swim. It could be draconian, but most immigrants were eager to be naturalized, integrated and mainstreamed. It worked. The recent arrives were assimilated and fears of replacement were dissipated. Then World War One came just in time to end the influx of alien millions before major other crises arose to end replacement fears. Following the popular reception of the movie Birth Of a Nation in 1913 and a racist Wilson administration there was a revival of the KKK. The nineteen twenties saw economic prosperity and restrictive immigration. Prosperity always calmed concerns about foreigners. Then the Great Depression and World War Two limited immigration. The post war prosperity made the 1950s the legendary American Gold Years: victory in war, economic prosperity for the majority of the people, and the high point of national global reach kept issues like replacement as backburner concerns.** 

**During the 1960s racial repression, cultural stagnation and growing division by income and social class were exacerbated by the Vietnam War. Well-intentioned but divisive revisions in immigration policy intended to liberalize society and the growing recognition of obvious social and economic disparities uncorked all the issues that have matured in the current period. White paranoia grew in the years after 1960 as Blacks, Gays and newly arrived aliens demanded equality. An influx of Asians, Moslems and Latinos from Puerto Rico and Mexico gave rise to vocal cultural conservativism.** 

**The Republicans welcomed immigrants as cheap labor and played the race card in response to the Democrats stance on civil liberties. The Democratic party responded to the new issues as they lost the support of the ‚Äòsolid south‚Äô to Republicans by embracing every minority group in a race for votes. Over-simplifying the changes, the export of manufacturing jobs to the third world‚Äôs masses of cheap labor, replacement of workers of all levels at home by computers and the economic collapse transforming the once industrial core of the nation into the ‚ÄúRust Belt‚Äù littered with abandoned factories and as employee payrolls declined and stateside production was replaced by outsourcing goods towns were strangled by a vanishing tax base. As the industrial base vanished the long held moderate middleclass center imploded.**  **The engineered economic stagnation was ignored. When the Democrats abandoned their working class base supporting agitation by previously repressed and exploited minorities they were seen as abetting ‚Äúconspiracies‚Äù by the native-born economic losers.** **The economics were complex but the social outcome obvious: whites were losing status, income and long held controls. Replacement emerged as the issue of the day. The very rich and their corporate entities cynically supported the socially conservative base as the prosperity upon which democratic compromise was based vanished. Fears of replacement grew in the flyover.** 

**Instead of uniting the country behind democratic reforms the changes divided the nation. While workers of different backgrounds faced the same issues which should have united them opportunists pressed all the racial buttons and longtime issues of discontent highlighting replacement fears. An indifference to popular concerns of their traditional base left Democrats focused on the minorities and newly arrived aliens‚Äô concerns. These so-called Democratic ‚Äúelites‚Äù abandoned and disparaged the melting pot achievements that had long united the nation in favor of multicultural diversity. The Democrats accent on diversity was simply the wrong path. Democracy only works when differences are narrowed and people have fewer issues to fear. When the system worked newly arrived immigrants were expected to drop old ways and adopt American ways: speak English, learn about the country‚Äôs ‚Äòlegendary‚Äô history, adopt American clothes, cuisine and mainstream. The current assault on the nation‚Äôs heritage, former leaders and actions is corrosive. It is also bad history.** 

**You cannot judge the past by the present. When slavery existed it was an institution with a heritage thousands of years old. It may have been wrong but it was legal. It was socially acceptable. It had Biblical sanction The very leaders of the anti-slavery movement were hypocritical exploiters of white men, women and children in mines and factories under horrendous conditions. Workers seeking to organize were repressed, jailed and murdered. Why are they not equally lamented and their exploiters condemned? Condemning people in the past for long established practice is simply illogical, poor history and pointless. No American today is legally engaged in the slave trade. No Americans born today legally owns slaves. If we make issue over past wrongs, why not sue the churches for burning witches and heretics and supporting slavery to its very end?** 

**You do not bring the country together by dividing it at the base. What we had worked even with all the pasts irregularities and inconsistencies. Different cultures have various values and heritages. When people emphasize their similarities‚Äô they become a community; the melting pot served the purpose of successfully integrating natives and recent arrives even in an era of wide disparities and immigration at its peak. It is still a relevant and effective program for assimilating aliens. If aliens migrate here it is because they recognize our culture offers benefits their own traditional societies do not offer.** 

**Why do so many native born so-called intellectuals view our cultural heritage as something to be lightly thrown out? Why do so many worship an alien multiculturism unrelated to an acknowledgement that real and often unreconcilable differences exist between people? Simply put, if aliens value their traditions more than those of our land they should stay home. If aliens want to come to America they need to recognize that it is incumbent on them to** **adapt and assimilate or face replacement threat hostility. We are under no obligation to toss out our heritage to accommodate foriegners. If they seek what America has to offer they need to do more than seek gold in the streets. They must accept Americanization if they want to reap the benefits. Alienated segments of the American self-styled ‚Äòelite‚Äô also need to recognize the native-born population has no obligation to accept and welcome people who insist on remaining aliens and retaining the very cultures they fled.** 

**What is wrong about protecting your heritage? We speak American English. We have done so for several hundred years. It is an un-called for adaptation to have phone calls, store and road signs, government paperwork and even citizenship related activities in an alien language. If one alien language why not every foreign language? Once we step on that slippery slope where do we end?**

**We never sold out our culture before by offering alternatives to English before. We didn‚Äôt offer education, government services or commercial accommodations, welfare, unpaid into social services and government programs to foreigners in the past and the system worked in advancing cultural integration. Our obligations are to native born citizens who pay taxes. Period! If people move here they have an obligation to learn English; we have no obligation to change our culture to please aliens. Try expecting other cultures to accommodate Americans! Even when we lavish billions of other countries we are still hated. We have no obligation to sell out our culture to appease others. All our programs and policies to please aliens is to a degree a manifestation self-loathing by Americans seeking to appease some personal angst and solicit others approval.**

**Historically, Americans have been more welcoming to foreigners than any other people. Hospitality has its limits. A limited immigration from culturally akin regions has always been welcome. Why not? Kinship, cultural affinity and blood relationship are significant positive issues and not necessarily the frequently labeled prejudicially motivated ranting of rabid racists. The same critics gush over the native Americans protecting hearth and home as a fundamental** **response to the arrival of alien Europeans.**  

**Some cultural baggage simply doesn‚Äôt travel well. Experience shows language is culturally flexible. America is awash with fast food from every quarter of the globe; we have been readily adaptive to change in small portions. Many immigrant people adapt to American English on the job while retaining a home spoken heritage language. How many families have a show kitchen on the main floor and the actual working kitchen in the basement? Often the divide is generational within a family as elders are resistant and youngsters open to change. New generations eventually adapt as youth culture involves outreach and experimentation with new ideas. Older immigrants tend to be resistant to adaptation and hold on to old ways in religion, specific forms of morality, values, dress, diet and cultural priorities. These issues especially come to the fore concerning strange cloths, diet, and morality religion. Some changes are impacted in unexpected ways: Covid reduced the shock of seeing masked people in the malls and main streets.** 

**Replacement fears are real. We must expect many alien practices are not going to be welcomed with enthusiasm. More than a thousand years of conflict between Christian and Moslem peoples isn‚Äôt going to vanish in a heartbeat.** **If the newly arrived people can‚Äôt adapt to us**  **it is their problem not ours. A commonly expressed sentiment abroad is ‚ÄúAmerican go home!‚Äù and like a phone call it works both ways. Is our culture worth defending? Do our have a right to resist change? The current replacement concerns are challenging as they concern alien intrusions introducing significant changes to cultural gut issues in our very homeland. Yes, we have a right to cherish and protect our heritage. Yes, we have a right to pick and choose who we prefer to admit to our homeland. And, yes, we have a heritage of gradually adapting to change provided we have the time to adjust to social evolution even if the time spans might appear glacial!**",theoryofpropaganda,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofpropaganda/comments/xm2erf/replacement_theory/,,MammothUse1337,xm2erf,/r/theoryofpropaganda/comments/xm2erf/replacement_theory/,https://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofpropaganda/comments/xm2erf/replacement_theory/,0,2022-09-23

How to get car to go into reverse and fix the reverse lockout with after market head unit,"2021 Subaru Crosstrek Sport

Sony XAV-AX1000 head unit

Used a bunch of harnesses from autoharness and everything works except for trying to put my car into reverse. Front/rear audio works, back up cam works, radio, etc, just cannot get my car to go into reverse. There is a small port next to the shift lever that I can stick a long thin object down to hit a button to physically allow my car to be put into reverse, but it sucks doing that every time. I am not sure how to get it to go into reverse 'normally' without that emergency workaround.

The plug-n-play feature of the autoharness is what drove me to buy their products but now I am worried about every day driving and letting others drive my car. I confirmed everything works and going into reverse works swapping back to the stock head unit. 

I even tapped into the reverse lockout wire on the stock wiring and attached to the after market reverse wire and that did nothing either.",CarAV,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/xm9uzs/how_to_get_car_to_go_into_reverse_and_fix_the/,,PP3V42G3H,xm9uzs,/r/CarAV/comments/xm9uzs/how_to_get_car_to_go_into_reverse_and_fix_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarAV/comments/xm9uzs/how_to_get_car_to_go_into_reverse_and_fix_the/,0,2022-09-23
Faux Controller Mods- Competitive Melee Controller Services,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 3tug1q65dop91...*

Hi SSBM of Reddit! I'm Faux, and I am a controller modder from the Midwest under the name of Faux Controller Mods (FXCM). I focus primarily on electrical and competitive enhancement mods but I provide a few aesthetic ones like paracords as well!

I love platform fighters &amp; Melee, and I want to branch out to let you know of my services! I have dozens of services available and pre-built competitive-tailored controllers made to order. If you are in the market to upgrade or buy a brand new enhanced conch, talk to me or let me help you! Please check out the links below for my request form and my detailed information document that will help to answer frequently asked questions.

[Fill out a request form](https://forms.gle/9hLAi123F1KkgEZ48)  
[Learn more about my services](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1APjIcZ5bkfi1n07ADwXk1DYJnW8LnWGGwMhHBnER-nQ/edit?usp=sharing)

Below are the three sets of controller mods I provide on order plus the option to build a factory new one of your own. Each model is detailed in my information document and is discounted at 10% of the cost of the sum of their parts!

*Processing img narqfcsfdop91...*

*How experienced are you, how long have you been doing this?*  
I've been tinkering with controllers for 3-4 years and I've been experimenting with my own Gamecube controllers for a little over one year. My business launched in late May this year and I've been steadily growing the list of services I provide.

*What about Phobs? Do you sell those?*  
I've made around three dozen Phob controllers in the past and I plan to begin selling more early next year or as soon as I can get bulk stock. Unfortunately, the chip shortage has made making large batches very difficult.

*How fast can you complete orders?*  
Time to complete orders is around one week plus receiving (if applicable) and sending shipping time. If I have extra controllers or additional stock available you may get it sooner. But if I'm backed up with requests, it may be closer to two weeks. I like to fully test any controllers or modifcations I make so that there are no issues upon receiving your request. Since I have only recently expanded services, all order time is to be determined with the flow of orders.",SSBM,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/xm9v7u/faux_controller_mods_competitive_melee_controller/,,Sirfauxfire,xm9v7u,/r/SSBM/comments/xm9v7u/faux_controller_mods_competitive_melee_controller/,https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/xm9v7u/faux_controller_mods_competitive_melee_controller/,0,2022-09-23

"US Stocks with Iron Clad Balance Sheets, Moats and more to Weather the Storm","Given the fast market downturn currently, I was interested in investing in good US stocks (they can be dividend paying or not) but was interested in the following:

"$TSLA, $AAPL, and $AMZN have yet to revisit their bear market lows, while the S&amp;P 500 and QQQ already have. Will these stocks follow the rest of the market?","Fundamentals aside, what do $TSLA, $AAPL, and $AMZN stocks have in common? 

Three things:

1. **They have yet to revisit their bear market lows** (they‚Äôre stronger than most of the market).
2. **They put in the first inkling of bullish market structure** (they experienced significant bounces and are trying for a higher low)
3. **Their social activity is growing substantially** (people are showing interest in these stocks. They‚Äôre talking about them across social and news &amp; posts about them are trending)

Let's look at these 3 things in chart format:

**Tesla $TSLA:**

[$TSLA Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/qa3ufmmv8op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=365e7f85b98c892e7b3f7006c7a4454d45f50977)

&amp;#x200B;

**Apple $AAPL:**

[$AAPL Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/u4sneh529op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9dfc715f237aeea7fa8e70d0d431136c9506414)

&amp;#x200B;

**Amazon $AMZN:**

[$AMZN Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/6xuy4lc89op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9c042709e68a346a119200ae6a487f50abb62a1)

As you can see, these stocks have noticeably increased social activity that appears to be trending up in the last 2-3 months.

Now, what about stocks that have already revisited their bear market lows? Let‚Äôs take a look at a couple of popular stock picks that have performed poorly price-wise and spot the differences:

**NVIDIA $NVDA:**

[$NVDA Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/l8dhcjzg9op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=20e30185a23cb56a6e87bb09bd5d9675f45c6d52)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Adobe $ADBE:**

[$ADBE Social Engagements, Mentions, &amp; Price \(6 months\)](https://preview.redd.it/ahfsazxi9op91.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b5e6446f2d5ea7aef2dd8def6348a41575a406b)

While $NVDA and $ADBE experienced recent spikes in social activity, they do not show the same kind of sustained growth in activity (continuous interest from people) as many of the better-performing stocks. 

Therefore, in times like these when the macro environment and markets are bearish, it‚Äôs probably best to keep your eye on stocks with sustainable increases in social activity, rather than the stocks with little growth or growth that fades quickly. 

So, will $TSLA, $AMZN, and $AAPL hold above their bear market lows? Or follow the rest of the market? 

While the social data presented in these charts don't provide the answers, they do provide a different perspective that's interesting to think about.

"How to invest during weak EUR, high inflation, and meek interest rate?","Hey,

I'm a bit confused and nervous with the current situation (title).

Currently, I'm DCA-ing MSCI World+EM with the classical 70+30 proportion.

Seeing EUR-USD rate, stock market going down, and the inflation makes me question my investment strategy. 

What are the best alternative?

1. Buying EUR hedged MSCI (or rather S&amp;P 500):  betting that the higher TER+Tax when EUR regains its strength won't eat up the currency gain and S&amp;P return.

2. Buy (US?) Bonds now that the Feds hiked the interest rate: betting stock market wont recover anytime soon, and the YTM won't be eaten by currency risk and the opportunity cost for future stock comeback.

3. Buy gold as store of value now that it's cheap: betting it will goes up again when interest rate is going down.  Reinvest to usual MSCI World+EM. Currency risk is there though, gold price RN in EUR actually is pretty high, thanks to EUR/USD rate.

4. Buy USD: betting EUR will goes down further, and buy back EUR when it regains strength, reinvest to usual MSCI World+EM.

5. Some/all of them, but at what proportion? I can only DCA ‚Ç¨1000 p.m., so my options are limited.

#1 and #2 are definitely taxable where I live,  3 and 4 is nice from tax perspective as they are tax free after 1 year holding period. 

Thoughts, please?

I almost killed myself last night,"I (m19) had a very rough breakup in April. I had been dating her for 2 years and then it just ended. I‚Äôve been struggling with severe depression and anxiety in addition to grieving and it‚Äôs been tough. 

I lost $4k in the stock market last year of my $10k college fund that my family had worked for which made me feel empty and like a disappointment. 

I‚Äôve tried putting myself out there on sites like tinder but of the thousands of swipes I‚Äôve made on people that I actually find interesting I‚Äôve only gotten 13 matches. Of the matches I haven‚Äôt had any actual luck with any and only actually saw 2 of them in person. 

I met this gorgeous girl last month and she showed me physical affection and she kissed me and it brought me so much confidence and happiness. She told me last night that she only likes me that way when she‚Äôs super drunk. 

I honestly wrote a note and was planning on driving my car into a tree as fast as i possibly could without the airbags. I was in a parking lot getting myself the courage to do it when I decided to call 988 because I just don‚Äôt want to die but my brain keeps screaming at me to do it. He told me to put my keys in the back seat and to call anyone. I called my best friend and I just broke down. 

She drove out to me and got me dinner and water and took me back home to rock me to sleep. It feels like she‚Äôs the only person I have left. 

I‚Äôm writing this at 3am. I‚Äôve been averaging 5 hours of sleep for over a month now. Im so tired and so sad and feel lonely. I really miss having someone that I can hug and cuddle. I really need human contact and I just don‚Äôt get a lot.

Where is Bitcoin on the Wall Street Cheat Sheet?,"The famous Wall Street cheat sheet (picture below) shows what goes through the minds of market participants during the different stages of a market cycle. **But where are we on the cheat sheet?**  

&amp;#x200B;

[Wall Street Cheat Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/wif1uj0j3mp91.png?width=1067&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de469dc36a3aab631b3e69fcf72746eb5f4df345)

When asking this question, it is important to realise that Bitcoin is a young asset with an insane adoption rate (see picture below), similar to the adoption rate of the internet back in the days. So one key assumption that follows is that we should not be expected to go down as much after all time high. If this assumption is wrong, we could hit the COVID lows, and we are somewhere in anxiety. Moreover, our cycles are shorter, at least so far, relative to traditional markets, in part due to the halving. 

[Adoption \(users\) of Internet vs. Crypto](https://preview.redd.it/9kpvwjtc6mp91.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22b4ddd7577789da2abd4682ab8e67a978ed6efe)

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking, what if we are in the anger period? it would look something like this:

[Bitcoin Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/9yyj2cgv3mp91.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec3e8ad173cf5609e249f96374f450c5b5449ffb)

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I think this? Well, firstly, we had a capitulation event with the shirtstorm of Luna and 3AC. The fractal around the time of this capitulation event is nearly identical to the fractal of the end of the 2018 bear market. A lot of retail exited the markets and Google Searches of Bitcoin are low. This sub also shows a clear lack in activity relative to the bull market. Moreover, the chart below clearly shows that capitulation already happened, as a lot of bitcoin was being sold with heavy losses (indicated in the red below), similar to levels of previous bear markets. Of course, it is possible that we could have more capitulation, as the macro environment is terrible and we are heavily correlated to the stock market.

[Green indicates people selling Bitcoin at a profit, red indicates people selling at a loss](https://preview.redd.it/j9llzb557mp91.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a8cb20e043e167b9fe57c788a36b3a0b33d4e4b)

Moreover, we are clearly going sideways, which reminds me of the anger phase that leads up to the low. People are angry and calling for 10-14K. This might happen, of course. But there is an interesting parallel to the top, where everyone was calling for 100k to happen. 

If the idea of us being in the anger phase is true, we can expect a lot of crabbing. This view mirrors a similar fractal from the 2015 Bitcoin Chart:

&amp;#x200B;

It would be a bit weird that the complacency level was higher than the Euphoria level, though. *But*, it is clear that the feeling of euphoria was higher during the 2021 April high relative to the 2021 November high. In April, retail interest was highest, and everyone had diamond hands and laser eyes. Google searches of Bitcoin were at all time high. RSI was the highest also. So from that perspective it does make sense.

"If you HODL Bitcoin and feel nothing when the Bitcoin price falls or rises, because you opted for a low-time preference, I want to congratulate you: You are a Bitcoiner!","It's all in the title.

Do you really understand the why of Bitcoin? If so, you're not going to let a 75 basis point rate hike by the Fed scare you off like the rest of the investment market that has a short-term view of things.

With Bitcoin, you've opted for a low-time preference. You know that Bitcoin is a long-term monetary revolution that transcends market cycles.

The economy and the stock market are cyclical, but the Bitcoin revolution is here to stay. The key is to focus on the fundamentals of Bitcoin. And Bitcoin's fundamentals haven't changed since its inception, so there's no reason to panic.

What is systematic risk?,"Systematic risk refers to the risk subjected to the entire market, economy or a market segment. **Systematic risk is also known as ‚Äòundiversifiable risk‚Äô** ‚Äúmarket risk‚Äô which affects the overall market, not just a particular stock or industry.

\- Systematic risk is subjected to the market as a whole, showing the impact of various economic, geopolitical, and financial factors.

\- This type of risk is distinguished from unsystematic risk, which impacts a specific industry or security. Eg: the CEO of a firm resigns. The effect of this will be limited to that particular firm only or a few other companies. But in case of a war, the whole economy will be affected.

\- Systematic risk is largely unpredictable and generally viewed as being difficult to avoid.

**Unsystematic risk can be managed through diversification of the portfolio.**

Yahoo morning briefing,"Who else is sick of talking about the Fed? Of course, the Federal Reserve and its battle against inflation using higher interest rates is vitally important. But I need a break.

‚Äå
So, on to another crucial question: Are zero-commission brokerages ripping you off?
‚Äå

The Securities and Exchange Commission is apparently deciding they are not ‚Äî or at least that the SEC isn't going to do anything about it even if they are. Bloomberg reports the agency has decided not to ban payment for order flow, known as PFOF. That‚Äôs a practice in which brokerages process customers‚Äô trades through wholesalers, in a way that critics say saddle individual traders with hidden fees.
‚Äå

The argument against PFOF is that the practice poses a conflict because, in theory, brokerages should be aiming to make money for their customers ‚Äî not market makers like Citadel Securities. In reality, it's tough to find many in favor of an all-out ban on PFOF aside from meme stock aficionados who populate Twitter and Reddit. Rather than banning PFOF, the SEC would be wise to focus on price transparency and requiring brokers to execute trades at the best price possible at the time.
‚Äå

‚ÄúThe SEC does not have to ban payment for order flow or other specific anti-investor, conflict-ridden market practices if it requires best execution to be the best available price at the time given order characteristics and market conditions,"" Dennis Kelleher, head of investor advocacy group Better Markets, told Yahoo Finance in an email. ""If it does that, the SEC won‚Äôt have to play whack-a-mole with an industry that is relentless in creating new wealth extraction practices that avoid yesterday‚Äôs rules and require new rules tomorrow.""
‚Äå

A crucial revenue stream for commission-free brokerages

‚Äå
In a PFOF model, a commission-free brokerage like Robinhood or Schwab processes an investor‚Äôs order for a stock purchase and passes it on to a wholesaler, like Citadel Securities or Virtu Americas. These market makers then execute the transaction and pay brokerage firms for routing the trade through them.
‚Äå

When the market maker can purchase a stock at a lower price than the customer asked for, the brokerage and the market maker split the savings. The money pocketed by the brokerages, the ""payment for order flow,"" can finance its commission-free business.

‚Äå
When the market maker can purchase a stock at a lower price than the customer asked for, the brokerage and the market maker split the savings. The money pocketed by the brokerages, the ""payment for order flow,"" can finance its commission-free business.


This an important revenue stream for Robinhood, which popularized the practice in 2020 when US households were flush with stimulus checks and ready to play the market. Since then, trading on Robinhood has declined ‚Äî along with its stock price ‚Äî and it has tried to diversify revenue streams.

‚Äå
According to analyst Devin Ryan of JMP Securities, PFOF made up 9% of Robinhood's equities revenue last quarter, 36% of options revenue, and 18% of crypto revenue. Shares of the company surged on the report that the SEC wasn‚Äôt planning to institute a ban. However, then Robinhood then erased that gain and closed down 2.72% at $9.65 a share ‚Äî far less than this time last year, when it was trading for five time as much.
‚Äå

Still, it's clear the Bloomberg report on the SEC's decision regarding PFOF is good for Robinhood. Is that gain coming at the expense of small investors?


Trading firms, predictably, think there‚Äôs no issue with the current system, and argue that retail traders already get good prices. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has largely taken the other side, saying in June that payment for order flow ‚Äúcan distort routing decisions.‚Äù
‚Äå

Watch: How does payment for order flow work?
‚Äå

The solution to that problem isn't to get rid of PFOF, according to Christopher Schwarz, a professor at the University of California Irvine, who co-authored that study. Instead, he said, brokerages should be more transparent about prices.
‚Äå

The debate over banning PFOF ‚Äúis the shiny thing in the room that is distracting everyone from the issue of market centers giving very different execution to different brokers. And that execution is not related to PFOF,"" Schwarz wrote Yahoo Finance on Thursday.
‚Äå

Jared Dillian, editor and publisher of the Daily Dirtnap and investment strategist at Mauldin Economics, argued last month for Bloomberg Opinion that regulation of PFOF could backfire.

‚Äå
""The US has the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world, but we might not if regulators start getting too involved,"" he wrote. ""As long as competition exists, things will get better and trading costs will come down even further.‚Äù
‚Äå

Undoubtedly, many on Wall Street agree with Dillian, and papers like those from Schwarz may have swayed the SEC to look at the issue differently. Of course, the agency might end up banning PFOF or restricting it. In the meantime, it's tough to say whether investors are mad at PFOF or just wary of the market these days.

‚Äå
The number of people trading via Robinhood has fallen this year, to 14 million monthly transacting users by June 2022 from 17.3 million last December. As Robinhood's user base has shrink, alternatives have cropped up ‚Äî including Public.com, which is commission-free, doesn‚Äôt offer payment for order flow, and allows users instead to offer a tip to brokers that execute their trades. The company says its users grew from 1 million in mid-2021 to 3 million in early 2022.

‚Äå
Ultimately, PFOF might fall out of favor, regardless of whether the SEC steps in to police the practice.",DeercreekvolsBlog,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeercreekvolsBlog/comments/xlx8yl/yahoo_morning_briefing/,,Andre3000RPI,xlx8yl,/r/DeercreekvolsBlog/comments/xlx8yl/yahoo_morning_briefing/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeercreekvolsBlog/comments/xlx8yl/yahoo_morning_briefing/,0,2022-09-23

Sunday in Nowhereville (budget_job4415),"Sundays are quite busy, it's when everyone goes to the market to stock up on weekly groceries and, for most of the people who live in Nowhereville or neighbouring districts, it's the only time they have to blow off steam with their families and enjoy the market food and entretainment.

So now we follow Josue, a thirty-something animal breeder who lives in a small neighbourhood about 10 minutes from Nowhereville. His ""home"" consists of two rooms: a bedroom with a 60 inch CRT TV at least twice as expensive than all other pieces of furniture in that room, a kitchen with a travel stove hooked to a propane tank, a small handmedown fridge and a cheap table onto which a tablecloth had been stapled on. The living quarters consisted of only 25m^(2) of the total 600m^(2) plot of land. He had an outhouse on the other side of his plot and almost all of the remaining space was for his breeding operation, almost. You see, Josue only had one thing he truly loved and cared for enough to fence off from the beasts in his yard and that was his white 2020 BMW z4, spending all his profits on paying off the thing and taking it to the shop whenever there was a new sound, no doubt from driving the poor thing on the pothole-filled, sandy dirt road.

On sunday mornings, Josue wakes up at around 2 am, retrieves a bag of chicken feed from the kitchen and takes it outside. First are the soon mummahs, then the mummahs and finally the breeding age mares. They are in three spaces separated by a low chickenwire fence that any healthy fluffy could jump over, they all have their one designated shitting corner. ""WAKE UP HARLOTS!"" the yard floods with whining and moaning as the 196 mares wake up and crawl grumpily to their respective food piles.

As the mummahs eat the coarse grain, Josue crouches down and inspects the foals one by one. Those born around last fortnight are ready to sell. He splashes them with the cold water and dumps them in a plastic tub. ""EEEEEEEHP S-S-SUU C-C-COOOWD!"" ""mU-MU-Mu-mumMAAAAAAAH! HE-HE-HEEWP-P-P B-B-BA-BABB-BEH"" ""W-WHY N-NIC-E-E M-M-MIS-S-T-TAAH"" ""W-WAA-WAAH AM B-B-BAAD-D F-FOH B-BB-ABB-BE"" The cries resound in the wind but most mummahs don't react, these are not their first babbehs, not even their tenth, most of the younger mummahs either know the rules or will learn soon enough. Once the tub is full, Josue dumps the foals in the kitchen so they can warm up and repeats the process, today he has around 400 units in stock

He next inspects the babbehs born around last week, the colt's balls are now easier to see and their manes have started to grow so he collects them in the tub. ""NU TAKEY BABBEH!"" one of the newest mummahs shouts, crawling towards Josue. He grabs her by the mane and tosses her behind him without a care, there is a moment of pause as the other fluffies look at the mare, screeching in pain since her front legs hadn't fully healed, but they continue eating, mostly put of fear for themselves.

Finally, Josue feeds his stallions. He goes to the rear wall of his property and pulls the plastic from the cages. All of the males are in their individual cage surrounding a water trough, all of them had bright colours in their youth and now, all of them have dirty fluff, scruffy manes and long, cracked hooves with probable infections. ""HEY DIPSHITS!"" Josue kicks the scrap metal cages as he pours the chicken feed on them. There is another, larger cage full of older colts and fillies who look a lot prettier but still recoil in fear at the meanie munstah daddeh as he pours the food. They will be taken one last time to the market today.

To finish, he dries the two week old babbehs softly, they coo lovingly and some even say ""nyu daddah?"" before Josue puts them in their respective pet carriers, one for each race and one more for the prettier ones. Once this is done, he grabs a pair of pliers and procedes to check each colt with more detail, the most beautiful will be new breeding stallions but the rest well... the sorry babbehs peep in fear and try to kick the cold pliers off their no-nos before violently screeching in crippling pain as their balls are crushed and twisted! most of them puke out the milkies from last night and all of them piss and shit themselves but none get the sweet release of death, Josue has been doing this for years now. After crushing 178 pairs of tiny balls, it's time to take his product to the market. There, josue will spend all day selling cutesy, clean and pretty fluffies to the public, using his charming 'you touch it, you pay it' strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

After a long day, Josue returns with only around a hundred fluffies, most of them cutesy little babbehs who happily go back to their uncaring mummahs. He washes, waxes and polishes his prize car and, as the sun sets in Nowhereville, Josue finishes his tasks. ""PEEEZE MUNSTAH DADDAH!"" one of the older colts begs, him and other seventeen colts and fillies couldn't be sold today ""COWT PWOMISSE FIND NYU MUMMAH PEEZEE!"" The begging grows more desperate as Josue brings the bucket with which he washed his car. ""NUUUUU PWEEEEZEEEE! cowt makey dancies foh-EEEEEEP"" Josue grabs the colts by their manes, one in each hand and plunges them in the dirty, soapy water. They kick and thrash with all their might, the remaining colts and fillies ugly-crying and begging and clumsily dancing for an Josue who, after exactly 105 seconds, pulls the limp bodies from the water and tosses them to the nearest shitpile before grabbing the next pair of males until the last one is just another piece of limp, cold pile in the shit. As for the fillies, they are so scared, hungry and traumatized that they barely have energy to cry anymore. They'll reach breeding age in a fortnight at most, so Josue brings a block of wood with two holes in them and a wooden mace, he places each fillie's front leggies in the holes and with a swift swing of the mace, he breaks each of the leggies so the hooves face each other. ""SCREEEEEEEE-EEEEEEEH-HEEE-HEEE"" The agonized wailing of the first fillie makes the other start to beg and dance and shout for their mummah once more, but to no avail. Soon, they will all be in the third penn and Josue will have 6 new breeding mares by next week.

To end the day, Josue goes over the soon mummah penn and checks if any were born while he was out. One of the mummahs tries to hide her chirpies but Josue lifts her up by the mane and tosses her to the side ""Dumb-ass vixen"" He counts five chirpies, scaredly crawling around for mummah, he grabs the smallest one and tosses it into the drowning bucket while mummah hu-huus silently. Finally, he grabs the mares whose legs he broke last week, they should've healed by now, sprays them with pheromones and tosses them with the caged stallions for the nigh.

At night, the only sounds are the constant ENFENFENF, tired ""NU WAAN PEEZE"" and quiet huu-huuing and sobbing.

Throughout next week, Josue will collect the mares and place new ones for the next day, he'll drown the ugly chirpies, he'll wash, wax and polish his BMW z4, he'll feed his herd once per day, he'll castrate more babbehs, he'll go out to drink with his friend, or take his car to the shop, or go to the nearest high-school and try to pick up seniors and life will go on in Bumfuck, Nowhereville",fluffycommunity,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fluffycommunity/comments/xmgxmt/sunday_in_nowhereville_budget_job4415/,Textpost - Abuse,Budget_Job4415,xmgxmt,/r/fluffycommunity/comments/xmgxmt/sunday_in_nowhereville_budget_job4415/,https://www.reddit.com/r/fluffycommunity/comments/xmgxmt/sunday_in_nowhereville_budget_job4415/,1,2022-09-24

* In regards to Congressional-hearings regarding **January 28, 2021, the date AMC &amp; Gamestop were forced into ‚ÄúPosition Close-Only‚Äù PCO** by most major broker-dealers like Robinhood, Webull, IBKR, etc. (When they pulled the ‚Äúbuy button‚Äù).

&amp;#x200B;

**Thomas Peterffy CEO of Interactive Brokers (IBKR):**

***‚ÄúSo if the longs had known (retail) that they had the right to ask for those shares (exercise), and they REALLY wanted the short squeeze, that‚Äôs what they would have done.‚Äù*** 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Known facts on GME:**
   * Leading to January 28, 2021, Melvin Capital **DIRECTLY SHORTED #GME**, opposed to shorting ETF‚Äôs, Depositary Receipts, Indices, or via Futures, ISDA contracts, Swaps, Married Puts/Calls, Divorced Puts/Calls, etc., there are many ways...
      * This **caused 140%+ short-interest to be visible** to the naked-eye on exchanges as Melvin forgot/carelessly failed to hide their short-positions.
   * **50 Million registered GME shares available.**
   * **75 Million shares were sold short** ***(that needed to be purchased).***
   * **150 Million additional shares short via call-options** ***(if retail had exercised call-contracts)***
   * **If long-calls had been exercised,** **shorts would have had to deliver 270 million shares while only 50 million shares existed on #GME alone.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Facts on AMC &amp; GME:**
   * The **long-broker-dealer would have had to buy the shares on the market at** **ANY PRICE** **pushing the price of GME into the thousands &amp; AMC‚Äôs price into the hundreds** (due to the variances in the prices at which they were trading prior to the beginning of the January squeeze).
   * **Shorts wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford to pay so shorts would‚Äôve defaulted on the broker-dealers that lent them the shares, the broker-dealers default on the clearing house (like OCC, DTC), leading to an** **inevitable collapse of many financial companies.**
   * As of Sept 1 2022, ISDA Phase 6 initial margin requirements were greatly increased to protect the DTC &amp; OCC from default &amp; CAT system was more fully implemented.
   * As of Sept 8 2022, to protect itself from default the Options Clearing Corporation has removed the maximum cap from pension funds that can be used to backstop their default, and **removed regulation that required the OCC to have to file advanced-notice** **with the SEC or regulatory bodies when they need to tap more pension funds** and can do so at any time.

&amp;#x200B;

**AMC Growth &amp; Business Development:**

* **Vastly increasing revenues and EBITDA (earnings) potential is incredibly high**, much more so than most people can actually imagine due to their growing status as a leader in movie-theater experiences, retail sales, and precious metals markets.
* Paid off debt &amp; refinanced debt for better interest rates, saving millions, removing covenants.
* AMC Theatres remains the #1 movie-theater company in the world.
* Growing liquidity &amp; diversification.

* Total **revenues grew to $1,166,400,000** compared to $444,700,000 for the 2nd quarter of 2021.
* Adjusted **EBITDA** **improved by $257.5 million** **to a** **POSITIVE $106.7 million****,** compared to a loss of $150.8 million for the 2nd quarter of 2021.
* In the 2nd quarter of 2022, AMC had **attendance** **of 59 million people at AMC Theaters globally,** **up 168%** from the 22 million attendees in the same quarter of 2021.
* AMC **owns their popcorn farms,** has an established supply chain, and can distribute their products directly to retail-store shelves.
* AMC has issued NFT‚Äôs and NFT movie-deals that have inspired more technologically-inclined attendees &amp; shareholders.
* Fewer films are being shown but more money is being made per film; **averaging $15 million per movie thus far in 2022, a number not seen since 2010.**
* 2010 was the year of Avatar, and Avatar 2 release is slated for December 16, 2022.
* Disney is offering exclusive showings/partnership with AMC Theaters.
* Warner Bros. has partnered with AMC Theaters to show movies exclusively in-theaters for 45 days during 2022.
* **Retail investors own 85% of the entire 516 Million share float.**

&amp;#x200B;

**AMC vs APE? Why Not Both?**

* **#AMC** issued a dividend in the form of stock called **#APE:**
   * **The** **total price of #AMC is now displayed as #AMC1****, a derivative basket which combines the price of #AMC &amp; #APE shares.** 
   * **Many broker-dealers including IBKR do not allow retail investors to buy AMC1**, they‚Äôre only allowed to **sell** or **EXERCISE** the long-calls issued on the #APE August 22, 2022 ex-dividend date. 
   * I have #**AMC1** in my IBKR account only because it was issued to me when the **#APE** dividend was distributed, otherwise I‚Äôm **unable to buy more on IBKR.**

&amp;#x200B;

**#AMC1 is now POSITION-CLOSE-ONLY on many broker-dealers and NO-ONE is talking about it!**

* **#AMC1 call-contracts entitles the holder of the long-call to exercise and receive 200 total shares, even during a short-squeeze:**
   * **100 shares of #AMC** 
   * **100 shares of #APE**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Brokers are making #AMC1 difficult to find in the #AMC options-chain under drop-down menus.**
   * Schwab has a drop-down menu at the top of the page (no prompt or button).
   * Fidelity has a drop-down menu listed as ‚ÄúAdjusted‚Äù.
   * **IBKR has AMC1 available as a ticker, but Position-Close-Only status.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **#APE will not be delisted unless it falls under $1 for several weeks.**
   * **CEO Adam Aron can convert #APE into #AMC1 to prevent delisting, and that** **would cause shorts to close** their positions by BUYING shares of #APE to deliver to the broker as a forced share-recall would occur.

&amp;#x200B;

* **T + 90 Day Liquidation of shorts by the brokers would automatically liquidate shorts &amp; force-close their positions at ANY-COST.**

## IV. Answers to Frequently-Asked Questions from Investors

### 1. Is all ‚Äúnaked‚Äù short selling abusive or illegal?

**When considering ‚Äúnaked‚Äù short selling, it is important to know which activity is the focus of discussion.**

* **Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement*****.*** **This activity would violate Regulation SHO, except for short sales by market makers engaged in bona fide market making activities.** **Market makers engaged in bona fide market making activities do not have to locate stock before selling short, because they need to be able to provide liquidity. Generally, to be eligible for the bona fide market making exception to the locate requirement, a broker dealer must hold itself out as being willing to buy and sell the security by providing and being at risk for widely available two-sided quotations at or near the market on the trading venue where it effects transactions for which it asserts the exception. Market makers are not excepted, however, from Regulation SHO‚Äôs close-out and pre-borrow requirements.**
* **Selling stock short and failing to deliver shares at the time of settlement****. Rule 204 requires firms that clear and settle trades to deliver securities to a registered clearing agency for clearance and settlement on a long or short sale in any equity security by the settlement date or to take action to close out failures to deliver by borrowing or purchasing securities of like kind and quantity by no later than the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day following the settlement date for short sale fails, or no later than at the beginning of trading hours on the third settlement day following the settlement date for long sale fails, and fails attributable to bona fide market making (‚Äúclose out date‚Äù). If a firm that clears and settles trades has a failure to deliver that is not closed out by the beginning of regular trading hours on the applicable close-out date, the firm has violated Rule 204 and the firm, and any broker-dealer from which it receives trades for clearance and settlement, is subject to the pre-borrow requirement for that security.**
* **Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement and failing to deliver shares at the time of settlement****. This activity may violate Regulation SHO‚Äôs locate and close-out requirements, as explained above. In addition, in fall 2008 the Commission adopted Rule 10b√¢‚Ç¨‚Äò21, referred to as the ‚Äúnaked‚Äù short selling anti fraud rule. Those who deceive about their intention or ability to deliver securities in time for settlement are committing fraud, in violation of Rule 10b-21, when they fail to deliver securities by the settlement date.**
* **Selling stock short and failing to deliver shares at the time of settlement with the purpose of driving down the security‚Äôs price****. This manipulative activity, in general, would violate various securities laws, including Rule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act.**

**Precious Metals Primary Bull Thesis:**

**Precious Metals are being purchased by governments &amp; central banks meanwhile they are massively shorting via derivatives contracts so they can continue to buy at the currently low prices before allowing the price on these PM‚Äôs to squeeze once the Central Bank Digital Coin (CBDC) is implemented as the CBDC‚Äôs will be tied to precious metals such as gold, silver, palladium etc.**

* JP Morgan has $248 Billion, 496 million  in notional PM derivative contracts
* Goldman has $18 Billion, 558 million in notional PM derivative contracts
* Citibank has $119 Billion, 877 million in notional PM derivative contracts
* In April 2021, Ted Butler of **Bank of America** noted they had increased the notional amount of their derivative contracts in precious metals to **$8.3 Billion**.

* **Shorts only have to report short-interest 2 X per month**
   * **Forcing daily short-interest reporting would fix the hole in the financial system that currently allows short hedge-funds to manipulate VISIBLE SHORT-INTEREST via Continuous Net Settlement, Depositary Receipts, ISDA contracts, Swaps, Futures, Married &amp; Divorced Puts/Calls, Rehypothecation, Synthetic share creation, Naked short selling, Failing to Deliver, Wash-Sales, Shorts marked as ""Long"", etc, etc, fucking etc...**

**Continuous Net Settlement (CNS)** 

* Continuous Net Settlement (CNS) is the primary clearing mechanism for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), American Stock Exchange (AMEX), National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), and other marketplaces. The National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) operates CNS, which is the securities industry's largest trade clearance and settlement system.  
* How the Product Works For each security, CNS nets down to one net buy and/or sell on all trades expected to settle on the next settlement day, including trades unable to settle on the previous settlement day. 
* After the trades are netted, free book-entry movements at DTC to or from Omnibus Account 888 allow NSCC participants to deliver short covers to NSCC and receive long allocations. 
* After the trades are netted, free book-entry movements at DTC to or from Omnibus account 888 allow NSCC participants to: 
   * Deliver short covers to NSCC (for those participants obligated to deliver securities)  ‚Ä¢
   * Receive long allocations from NSCC (for those participants entitled to receive securities).  
* To process transactions smoothly between DTC's system and the CNS system, DTC and NSCC have put in place certain collateralization arrangements and financial guarantees to ensure that:  ‚Ä¢ 
   * Debits created in DTC's system continue to be collateralized when the securities serving as collateral are delivered as CNS short covers, and  
   * Long allocations, or approximate values of long allocations, are made available to NSCC to cover certain exposures
* Short Covers 
   * When short covers are delivered from your DTC account, NSCC guarantees that: 
      * The value of securities received versus payment that are used for CNS short covers will be equal to the prior day's closing price, and  
      * The value of securities not received versus payment that are used for CNS short covers will be equal to the prior day's closing price less an applicable haircut. 
* In either case, your Collateral Monitor is increased by the amount guaranteed by NSCC. Without these guarantees, deliveries to CNS may not be permitted under DTC's collateralization rules because DTC would have neither the securities nor the collateral in the event of a failure to settle.  
* Note- The NSCC settlement credit generated from short covers cannot be used to offset your DTC settlement balance intraday. DTC and NSCC legal entity balances will be cross-endorsed before final net settlement figures are published. 
* **The short cover guaranty does not apply to ACATS transactions because there are no funds settlement obligations related to ACATS transfers.**

* **This proves the ISDA PHASE 6 implementation is negatively affecting short hedge-funds and MM that could potentially be manipulating and hiding short-interest and failures to deliver**

   * An ISDA Master Agreement is the standard document regularly used to govern **over-the-counter derivatives transactions.**
* **Flex Options**
   * Flexible exchange options, or FLEX options, are nonstandard options that **allow both the writer and purchaser to negotiate various terms.** Terms that are negotiable include the **exercise style, strike price, and expiration date,** as well as other features and benefits. These options also give investors the opportunity to trade on a larger scale with expanded or eliminated position limits. 
   * FLEX options are a specialized kind of option offering extreme negotiable flexibility.

**Married Puts**

* A married put is also considered a synthetic long call since it has the same profit profile. The strategy is similar to buying a regular call option (without the underlying stock) because the same dynamic is true for both: limited loss, unlimited potential for profit. The difference between these strategies is simply how much less capital is required in simply buying a long call.
   * [Married Put Definition ‚Äì Options &amp; Derivatives Trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marriedput.asp)

**Synthetic Puts**

* A synthetic put is an options strategy that combines a short stock position with a long call option on that same stock **to mimic a long put option.** It‚Äôs also called a synthetic long put. Essentially, an investor who has a short position in a stock purchases an at-the-money call option on that same stock. 
* **This action is taken to protect against appreciation in the stock‚Äôs price.** 
* A synthetic put is also known as a married call or protective call. 

**A reverse conversion** 

* A form of arbitrage that enables options traders to profit from an overpriced put option no matter what the underlying does. **The trade consists of selling a put and buying a call to create a synthetic long position while shorting the underlying stock**.
   * [Reverse Conversion Definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverseconversion.asp#:~:text=A%20reverse%20conversion%20is%20a,while%20shorting%20the%20underlying%20stock).
* **As stated above, OTC Flex Options aren‚Äôt sent to CBOE, they instead go straight to ISDA and never gets to any exchange.**
* Flex options have no position limit so they can have massive numbers of contracts at any time and can are used in combination with all of the methods mentioned above to hide short-interest, and delay &amp; suppress Failures to Deliver. 
   * **By not fulfilling their FTD‚Äôs the price is suppressed even further.**

**What Is Wash Trading &amp; How Profitable Is It?**

* Wash trading is an illegal type of trading in which a broker and trader collude to make profits by feeding misleading information to the market.
* **High-frequency trading firms and cryptocurrency exchanges use wash trading to manipulate prices.**
* Wash trading returned to the headlines in 2013, right as the phenomenon of [high frequency trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/high-frequency-trading.asp) was becoming widespread. High frequency trading is the practice of using super fast computers and high-speed Internet connections to perform upwards of tens of thousands of trades per second.
* Wash trades are essentially **trades that cancel each other out** and have no commercial value, as such. But they are used in a variety of trading situations.
* For example, **wash trades were used in the** [**LIBOR scandal**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor-scandal.asp) **to pay off brokers who manipulated the** [**LIBOR**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) submission panels for the Japanese Yen. According to charges filed by the UK financial authorities, **UBS traders conducted nine wash trades with a brokerage firm to generate 170,000 pounds in fees** as reward for the firm for its role in manipulating LIBOR rates.
* Wash trades can also be **used to generate fake volumes for a stock and pump its price.** Suppose a trader XYZ and brokerage firm collude to buy and sell stock ABC rapidly. Noticing activity on the stock, other traders may put money into ABC to profit from its price movements. XYZ **then shorts the stock, thereby profiting from its downward price movement**.

  **#APE: The AMC Preferred Equity**

* APE is a preferred equity and supposed to settle in T+0 days, but data shows it has been settling in T+2 days.
* Failures to Deliver on the 1st day of reporting was on August 24, 2022, which was 2 days after the ex-dividend date of August 22, 2022
* **On that 1st reporting date of August 24 2022, there were over 43,438,257 FTD‚Äôs**

&amp;#x200B;

* **Many #AMC investors didn‚Äôt receive their shares of #APE for several days and even weeks as market makers &amp; shorts had to wait &amp; try to convince retail to sell their shares of #APE in order to fulfill orders to other broker-dealers and in turn their retail investor.**
   * **The methods listed above for hiding short-interest and FTD‚Äôs are the same methods used to suppress the Failures to Deliver on #APE, ISDA contracts and CNS program, et al.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **#AMC1** (the long-calls holding 100 #APE &amp; 100 #AMC shares underlying) will cause **FTD‚Äôs to spike around the T+35 day settlement rules.**

&amp;#x200B;

* **#APE** was not technically an IPO, but **as dividend it did ‚ÄúIPO‚Äù on the ex-dividend date, and therefor ‚Äúsyndicates‚Äù were created and would still need to deliver by the ex-dividend disbursement date rule of T+90 days** from August 22, 2022. 
   * **T + 90 Day liquidation by lending brokers to the shorts may occur if #APE hasn‚Äôt been delivered by that date \~ November 23, 2022.**
   * The shorts that needed to provide the dividend in this case are the ‚Äúsyndicate‚Äù.
   * **Defaulting on the delivery of #APE would result in asset liquidation &amp; automated closing of positions.**
   * **FINRA Rule # 11880 section (b): Final settlement of syndicate accounts shall be effected by the syndicate manager within 90 days following the syndicate settlement date.**

&amp;#x200B;

* Notable T+90 Day liquidations as the syndicates failed-to-deliver in the past are as follows;

I just want to rant about everything,"August: 2021 I break up with my habitual cheating lying gf of 7 years, pretty sure she had ASPD. I feel pathetic and realize I have abandonment issues due to my childhood in foster care

Next week I rupture my Achilles‚Äô tendon, drive home, can‚Äôt walk for months

Day after injury I go drive to doctors office and and limp to ER, leg not working, I catch Covid at the doctors office 

Go home to the place I shared with my ex for years, sick, heartbroken and alone

Spend the next few months laying in bed, peeing in a bucket and eating cheeseits and pop tarts because I can‚Äôt stand

I place an overleveraged bet while having this mental breakdown, the stock market proceeds to decline at a historic pace

I lose $500,000 that I spent the last 10 years earning by investing with disciple

As soon as I can walk I move to a new city, driving 24 hours across the country

I cut off my family that mostly called me to ask for money, and nothing else. 

During my breakdown I scheduled plastic surgery, that I know longer really want but it was expensive and none refundable, not sure what to do about it

Ever since I started waking again my body has had weird issues all over, but it seems to be getting better

I check in on my ex and she was out being promiscuous with dozens of men since the day I broke up with her, she didn‚Äôt even wait a day

She says she wants me back in her life more than anything, but doesn‚Äôt show it through sky actions, purposely never writes me first, and this somehow still kills my self esteem 

I think I need to get a job for the first time in 10 years, and I‚Äôm worried that my lack of work experience will make this hell

Someone broke into my car this morning, and stole a bunch of stuff, and left the door open in the rain

My car alarm keeps going off randomly, and I can‚Äôt figure out why, it‚Äôs been doing that since my ex crashed it, but I paid to get it fixed so it sucks there‚Äôs still issues

I can‚Äôt find the will to try to date other women, I just hate the idea of loving someone and getting betrayed or abandoned, it feels peaceful alone

All the people that abused me as a kid got away with no consequences

I‚Äôm really looking forward to not being alive, but I‚Äôm not suicidal",rant,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/xmioig/i_just_want_to_rant_about_everything/,,ibexVR,xmioig,/r/rant/comments/xmioig/i_just_want_to_rant_about_everything/,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/xmioig/i_just_want_to_rant_about_everything/,0,2022-09-24

# **Dow drops nearly 500 points to close at new low for 2022 on rising recession fears - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/22/futures-inch-higher-following-another-day-of-losses-after-fed-rate-hike-sell-offs.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled Friday to cap a brutal week for financial markets, as surging interest rates and foreign currency turmoil heightened fears of a global recession.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 486.27 points, or 1.62%, to 29,590.41. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.72% to 3,693.23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.8% to 10,867.93.
*****
&gt; The Dow notched a new low for the year and closed below 30,000 for the first time since June 17. The 30-stock index ended the day 19.9% below an intraday record, flirting with bear market territory. At one point, the Dow was down more than 826 points.
*****
&gt; The major averages capped their fifth negative week in six, with the Dow giving up 4%. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq shed 4.65% and 5.07%, respectively. It marked the fourth negative session in a row for stocks, as the Fed on Wednesday enacted another super-sized rate hike of 75 basis points and indicated it would do another at its November meeting.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe market has been transitioning clearly and quickly from worries over inflation to concerns over the aggressive Federal Reserve campaign,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial. ‚ÄúYou see bond yields rising to levels we haven‚Äôt seen in years ‚Äî it‚Äôs changing the mindset to how does the Fed get to price stability without something breaking.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The British pound hit a fresh more than three-decade low against the U.S. dollar after a new U.K. economic plan that included a slew of tax cuts rattled markets that are fearing inflation above all right now. Major European markets lost 2% on the day.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThis is a global macro mess that the market is trying to sort out,‚Äù Krosby said.
*****
&gt; Bond yields soared this week following the Fed‚Äôs actions, with the 2-year and 10-year Treasury rates hitting highs not seen in over a decade.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs cut its year-end S&amp;P 500 target because of rising rates, predicting at least a 4% downside from here.
*****
&gt; Stocks positioned to suffer the most in a recession led the week‚Äôs losses with the S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s consumer discretionary sector falling 7%. Energy slumped 9% as oil prices dropped. Growth stocks, including big technology names Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms fell on Friday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúBased on our client discussions, a majority of equity investors have adopted the view that a hard landing scenario is inevitable and their focus is on the timing, magnitude, and duration of a potential recession and investment strategies for that outlook,‚Äù wrote Goldman Sachs‚Äô David Kostin in a note to clients as he cut his outlook.

&gt; So, it might be a bit late for Sell Rosh Hashanah, but Buy Yom Kippur is looking like a good set up. A host of fears from inflation, hawkish Fed, bellicose Russia, global upheaval, US midterm politics is exacerbating the usual seasonal and 4-year cycle carnage.

&gt; The thesis is that folks sell positions on Rosh Hashanah the first of the Days of Awe to rid themselves of financial commitments and then return to the market after Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It is no coincidence that this coincides with the seasonal September/October weakness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/73ee07aab9aad9010423b62e060f0ce7/8489dff9c57e81f8-a9/s500x750/8283b997870471cc877e46b4686b6b8734cd2e12.jpg))**

&gt; Interestingly the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period is not so bad in midterm years, likely due to the fact it lands at the end of the Weak Spot and the beginning of the Sweet Spot of the 4-Year cycle ‚Äì the best buying opportunity of the 4-Year Cycle.

&gt; # Five Reasons Inflation Isn‚Äôt So Sticky

&gt; After the disappointing all around Consumer Price Index (CPI) report last week, the worries over inflation staying higher for longer (what they call sticky) is a very real worry. That report showed prices for many goods and services were increasing more than expected (even things like dental services were much higher than expected), while nearly every economist we saw on tv before the report was saying inflation had peaked and would be heading down, and in a hurry.

&gt; Full disclosure, I was in that camp as well, as I discussed with Yahoo! Finance here.

&gt; Well, it isn‚Äôt all bad news, as there are many signs inflation could still come back down quickly. For one thing gas prices continue to head lower, as my colleague Sonu Varghese recently wrote about. Sure, core consumer prices (excluding energy and food) are higher than anyone would like, but there are other types of inflation than just at the consumer level.

&gt; Here are five reasons that suggest inflation could still fall quite quickly and last month‚Äôs CPI data isn‚Äôt the beginning of a new trend.

&gt; First up, used car prices collapsed four percent last month according to the Manheim Used Car Value Index. This was the second largest monthly decline ever and the year-over-year change is down to 8.4%, the lowest since June 2020. This large drop wasn‚Äôt accounted for in the recent CPI report and will put downward pressure on prices over the coming months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-092122.png))**

&gt; Second, how much companies are paying for things is going down and quickly. Looking at the prices paid component of the ISM services and manufacturing surveys show a big move lower the past few months. Prices paid tends to lead overall CPI by several months, and so this is another reason to think inflation could come down quickly before year-end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-092122.png))**

&gt; Third, the ISM is a national survey, but regional surveys show similar results. The recent Philly Fed and Empire State surveys each show prices paid crashing lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-092122.png))**

&gt; Fourth, supply chain issues were a major reason for the huge spike in inflation. So, you would think once those supply chains begin to improve, so would inflation. The good news is we are seeing substantial improvements in supply chains. For instance, back in January more than 100 ships were caught in a logjam at the Port of Los Angeles, yet earlier this month there were less than 10 ships. And as the chart below shows, overall supply chain pressures have come down significantly. Another source of potential downward pressure on overall inflation.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-092122.png))**

&gt; Lastly, prices at the producer level have come back much quicker than at the consumer level. The Producer Price Index (PPI) year-over-year peaked at 11.6% in March, but it was already down to 8.7% five months later. Compare that with the CPI peaking at just over 9.0% and only at 8.3% currently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-5-092122.png))**

&gt; So there you have it. Inflation is still a major issue, and that recent CPI report wasn‚Äôt pretty in any way. But there is light at the end of the inflation tunnel, as other aspects of inflation is showing some incredible improvement and not many people are noticing.

***** 

&gt; # September to (Not) Remember

&gt; Hat tip George Noble @gnoble79 for this title from his superb Twitter Space today. He has been on point all year. Disappointing CPI and increasingly hawkish remarks and action from the Fed clearly brought the usual September peak early. But that does not mean we are out of the woods.

&gt; Late September is still a dangerous period for the market, especially month-end, and then there is Octoberphobia to contend with, which promises to be turbulent with all the market must digest. On top of the Fed, inflation, weaker fundamentals, fickle market internals, shaky technicals we have the negative seasonality from fund tax selling, end of Q3 window dressing and portfolio restructuring.

&gt; We have been cautious all year and mostly in cash, having honored our stops and indicators. June lows are only 1% away for the Dow, S&amp;P 3.4%, NASDAQ 5.4%, Russell 2000 6.8%. Cash is still king. Patience is in order. We are sticking to our Seasonal Trading Playbook. If you‚Äôre not nimble and able to trade quickly, wait for our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

&gt; # Worse Before It Gets Better

&gt; For those checking in on our Seasonality Tool in the past week, the current point of the year can either look like one of the worst, middling, or best times of the year depending on the time frame. As shown below, the median one-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the close on 9/20 over the last ten years has been a decline of 95 bps loss which ranks in just the fourth percentile of all days of the year. Extending out to look at the S&amp;P 500's median one-month performance, the 105 bps median gain is about smack dab in the middle of the range of historical one-month returns. Moving out to three months, the S&amp;P 500's median gain of 578 bps ranks in the top 5% of all days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-1.png))**

&gt; To look at seasonality in another way, the charts below show the average S&amp;P 500 5-day performance (including a smoothed look via a 7-day moving average) and the percentage of time the index has traded positively at each calendar day of the year going all the way back to 1945. The current week of the year has averaged some of the worst one-week returns for the S&amp;P 500 across all years of the post-WWII period while the index has tended to fall more often than not.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-5-Day.png))**

&gt; Again, contrary to short-term seasonal weakness, taking a similar look but using a 3-month performance window, we are entering one of the best times of the year. As shown below, the second half of September into October sees the average 3-month performance rocket higher and by early October has tended to be the strongest of any point of the year.

&gt; # The Biggest Pandemic Losers

&gt; With President Biden declaring that ""the pandemic is over"" on 60 Minutes last night, we thought we'd take a look at stock market performance since the pandemic began. At its peak on January 3rd, 2022, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 40% from its closing price on February 19th, 2020 -- the peak reading for the index prior to the COVID Crash. After entering bear market territory in 2022, the S&amp;P is currently only 14% above its pre-COVID high. In the Russell 1,000 -- another large-cap index -- 41% of stocks are now trading below their closing price on February 19th, 2020. 20% of stocks in the index are down more than 20%! Given that two and a half years have passed, we think it's safe to say that any stock down 20% from pre-COVID levels has been a ""pandemic loser."" At least at this point in time.

&gt; Below are stocks with market caps above $15 billion that are down at least 20% from their closing price on 2/19/20. Names like Boeing (BA), Delta (DAL), Uber (UBER), and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) were some of the initial ""lockdown losers"" that never really recovered, but other stocks that were initially viewed as ""lockdown winners"" are also on the list like Netflix (NFLX), Meta (META), Spotify (SPOT), and Zoom Video (ZM). Go figure.

&gt; Boeing (BA) and Intel (INTC) have been two of the biggest losers since pre-COVID with declines of more than 56%. Other ""blue chips"" that have been crushed since the pandemic hit include Biogen (BIIB), Citigroup (C), General Electric (GE), Verizon (VZ), 3M (MMM), Square (SQ), Disney (DIS), Adobe (ADBE), and salesforce (CRM). It's interesting that there's representation from nearly every sector of the economy on this list. The only sector that's NOT included is Energy, which is crazy since the sector was one of the hardest hit in the early days of COVID as the price of oil even went negative for a day.

&gt; Of course, COVID isn't the reason why all of these large-cap stocks are now down so much since the pandemic began, but the performance numbers are the performance numbers, and there's no getting around it. Management at big travel &amp; leisure companies have always wished COVID never happened, but more and more companies in sectors like Tech that thought the pandemic might be a game-changer for them in a positive way are now staring at big 2+ year declines thinking ""what the hell just happened.""

"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning September 26th, 2022","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stockstoday! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 26th, 2022.

# **Dow drops nearly 500 points to close at new low for 2022 on rising recession fears - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/22/futures-inch-higher-following-another-day-of-losses-after-fed-rate-hike-sell-offs.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks tumbled Friday to cap a brutal week for financial markets, as surging interest rates and foreign currency turmoil heightened fears of a global recession.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 486.27 points, or 1.62%, to 29,590.41. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.72% to 3,693.23, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.8% to 10,867.93.
*****
&gt; The Dow notched a new low for the year and closed below 30,000 for the first time since June 17. The 30-stock index ended the day 19.9% below an intraday record, flirting with bear market territory. At one point, the Dow was down more than 826 points.
*****
&gt; The major averages capped their fifth negative week in six, with the Dow giving up 4%. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq shed 4.65% and 5.07%, respectively. It marked the fourth negative session in a row for stocks, as the Fed on Wednesday enacted another super-sized rate hike of 75 basis points and indicated it would do another at its November meeting.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe market has been transitioning clearly and quickly from worries over inflation to concerns over the aggressive Federal Reserve campaign,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial. ‚ÄúYou see bond yields rising to levels we haven‚Äôt seen in years ‚Äî it‚Äôs changing the mindset to how does the Fed get to price stability without something breaking.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The British pound hit a fresh more than three-decade low against the U.S. dollar after a new U.K. economic plan that included a slew of tax cuts rattled markets that are fearing inflation above all right now. Major European markets lost 2% on the day.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThis is a global macro mess that the market is trying to sort out,‚Äù Krosby said.
*****
&gt; Bond yields soared this week following the Fed‚Äôs actions, with the 2-year and 10-year Treasury rates hitting highs not seen in over a decade.
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs cut its year-end S&amp;P 500 target because of rising rates, predicting at least a 4% downside from here.
*****
&gt; Stocks positioned to suffer the most in a recession led the week‚Äôs losses with the S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s consumer discretionary sector falling 7%. Energy slumped 9% as oil prices dropped. Growth stocks, including big technology names Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta Platforms fell on Friday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúBased on our client discussions, a majority of equity investors have adopted the view that a hard landing scenario is inevitable and their focus is on the timing, magnitude, and duration of a potential recession and investment strategies for that outlook,‚Äù wrote Goldman Sachs‚Äô David Kostin in a note to clients as he cut his outlook.

&gt; So, it might be a bit late for Sell Rosh Hashanah, but Buy Yom Kippur is looking like a good set up. A host of fears from inflation, hawkish Fed, bellicose Russia, global upheaval, US midterm politics is exacerbating the usual seasonal and 4-year cycle carnage.

&gt; The thesis is that folks sell positions on Rosh Hashanah the first of the Days of Awe to rid themselves of financial commitments and then return to the market after Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. It is no coincidence that this coincides with the seasonal September/October weakness.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/73ee07aab9aad9010423b62e060f0ce7/8489dff9c57e81f8-a9/s500x750/8283b997870471cc877e46b4686b6b8734cd2e12.jpg))**

&gt; Interestingly the Sell Rosh Hashanah/Buy Yom Kippur period is not so bad in midterm years, likely due to the fact it lands at the end of the Weak Spot and the beginning of the Sweet Spot of the 4-Year cycle ‚Äì the best buying opportunity of the 4-Year Cycle.

&gt; # Five Reasons Inflation Isn‚Äôt So Sticky

&gt; After the disappointing all around Consumer Price Index (CPI) report last week, the worries over inflation staying higher for longer (what they call sticky) is a very real worry. That report showed prices for many goods and services were increasing more than expected (even things like dental services were much higher than expected), while nearly every economist we saw on tv before the report was saying inflation had peaked and would be heading down, and in a hurry.

&gt; Full disclosure, I was in that camp as well, as I discussed with Yahoo! Finance here.

&gt; Well, it isn‚Äôt all bad news, as there are many signs inflation could still come back down quickly. For one thing gas prices continue to head lower, as my colleague Sonu Varghese recently wrote about. Sure, core consumer prices (excluding energy and food) are higher than anyone would like, but there are other types of inflation than just at the consumer level.

&gt; Here are five reasons that suggest inflation could still fall quite quickly and last month‚Äôs CPI data isn‚Äôt the beginning of a new trend.

&gt; First up, used car prices collapsed four percent last month according to the Manheim Used Car Value Index. This was the second largest monthly decline ever and the year-over-year change is down to 8.4%, the lowest since June 2020. This large drop wasn‚Äôt accounted for in the recent CPI report and will put downward pressure on prices over the coming months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-1-092122.png))**

&gt; Second, how much companies are paying for things is going down and quickly. Looking at the prices paid component of the ISM services and manufacturing surveys show a big move lower the past few months. Prices paid tends to lead overall CPI by several months, and so this is another reason to think inflation could come down quickly before year-end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-2-092122.png))**

&gt; Third, the ISM is a national survey, but regional surveys show similar results. The recent Philly Fed and Empire State surveys each show prices paid crashing lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-3-092122.png))**

&gt; Fourth, supply chain issues were a major reason for the huge spike in inflation. So, you would think once those supply chains begin to improve, so would inflation. The good news is we are seeing substantial improvements in supply chains. For instance, back in January more than 100 ships were caught in a logjam at the Port of Los Angeles, yet earlier this month there were less than 10 ships. And as the chart below shows, overall supply chain pressures have come down significantly. Another source of potential downward pressure on overall inflation.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-4-092122.png))**

&gt; Lastly, prices at the producer level have come back much quicker than at the consumer level. The Producer Price Index (PPI) year-over-year peaked at 11.6% in March, but it was already down to 8.7% five months later. Compare that with the CPI peaking at just over 9.0% and only at 8.3% currently.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Graph-5-092122.png))**

&gt; So there you have it. Inflation is still a major issue, and that recent CPI report wasn‚Äôt pretty in any way. But there is light at the end of the inflation tunnel, as other aspects of inflation is showing some incredible improvement and not many people are noticing.

***** 

&gt; # September to (Not) Remember

&gt; Hat tip George Noble @gnoble79 for this title from his superb Twitter Space today. He has been on point all year. Disappointing CPI and increasingly hawkish remarks and action from the Fed clearly brought the usual September peak early. But that does not mean we are out of the woods.

&gt; Late September is still a dangerous period for the market, especially month-end, and then there is Octoberphobia to contend with, which promises to be turbulent with all the market must digest. On top of the Fed, inflation, weaker fundamentals, fickle market internals, shaky technicals we have the negative seasonality from fund tax selling, end of Q3 window dressing and portfolio restructuring.

&gt; We have been cautious all year and mostly in cash, having honored our stops and indicators. June lows are only 1% away for the Dow, S&amp;P 3.4%, NASDAQ 5.4%, Russell 2000 6.8%. Cash is still king. Patience is in order. We are sticking to our Seasonal Trading Playbook. If you‚Äôre not nimble and able to trade quickly, wait for our Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

&gt; # Worse Before It Gets Better

&gt; For those checking in on our Seasonality Tool in the past week, the current point of the year can either look like one of the worst, middling, or best times of the year depending on the time frame. As shown below, the median one-week performance of the S&amp;P 500 from the close on 9/20 over the last ten years has been a decline of 95 bps loss which ranks in just the fourth percentile of all days of the year. Extending out to look at the S&amp;P 500's median one-month performance, the 105 bps median gain is about smack dab in the middle of the range of historical one-month returns. Moving out to three months, the S&amp;P 500's median gain of 578 bps ranks in the top 5% of all days.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-1.png))**

&gt; To look at seasonality in another way, the charts below show the average S&amp;P 500 5-day performance (including a smoothed look via a 7-day moving average) and the percentage of time the index has traded positively at each calendar day of the year going all the way back to 1945. The current week of the year has averaged some of the worst one-week returns for the S&amp;P 500 across all years of the post-WWII period while the index has tended to fall more often than not.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/09/092022-Season-5-Day.png))**

&gt; Again, contrary to short-term seasonal weakness, taking a similar look but using a 3-month performance window, we are entering one of the best times of the year. As shown below, the second half of September into October sees the average 3-month performance rocket higher and by early October has tended to be the strongest of any point of the year.

&gt; # The Biggest Pandemic Losers

&gt; With President Biden declaring that ""the pandemic is over"" on 60 Minutes last night, we thought we'd take a look at stock market performance since the pandemic began. At its peak on January 3rd, 2022, the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 40% from its closing price on February 19th, 2020 -- the peak reading for the index prior to the COVID Crash. After entering bear market territory in 2022, the S&amp;P is currently only 14% above its pre-COVID high. In the Russell 1,000 -- another large-cap index -- 41% of stocks are now trading below their closing price on February 19th, 2020. 20% of stocks in the index are down more than 20%! Given that two and a half years have passed, we think it's safe to say that any stock down 20% from pre-COVID levels has been a ""pandemic loser."" At least at this point in time.

&gt; Below are stocks with market caps above $15 billion that are down at least 20% from their closing price on 2/19/20. Names like Boeing (BA), Delta (DAL), Uber (UBER), and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) were some of the initial ""lockdown losers"" that never really recovered, but other stocks that were initially viewed as ""lockdown winners"" are also on the list like Netflix (NFLX), Meta (META), Spotify (SPOT), and Zoom Video (ZM). Go figure.

&gt; Boeing (BA) and Intel (INTC) have been two of the biggest losers since pre-COVID with declines of more than 56%. Other ""blue chips"" that have been crushed since the pandemic hit include Biogen (BIIB), Citigroup (C), General Electric (GE), Verizon (VZ), 3M (MMM), Square (SQ), Disney (DIS), Adobe (ADBE), and salesforce (CRM). It's interesting that there's representation from nearly every sector of the economy on this list. The only sector that's NOT included is Energy, which is crazy since the sector was one of the hardest hit in the early days of COVID as the price of oil even went negative for a day.

&gt; Of course, COVID isn't the reason why all of these large-cap stocks are now down so much since the pandemic began, but the performance numbers are the performance numbers, and there's no getting around it. Management at big travel &amp; leisure companies have always wished COVID never happened, but more and more companies in sectors like Tech that thought the pandemic might be a game-changer for them in a positive way are now staring at big 2+ year declines thinking ""what the hell just happened.""

WhyTF did I Get Assigned? - Newb Question or Not,"Ok.  So, I'm not super new to options, but far from an expert. BUT, WTF.

I sold 25 put option contracts of RKT at $7.00 Strike, expired 9/23.

4PM on Friday, options expired, and price was exactly $7.00.   How did I get assigned and purchase 2500 shares of RKT?  Price was at $6.91 at 5PM, and $7.02 at 6PM, now flat after full market close at $7. 

So, no major impact, but isn't sh't supposed to close worthless at 4PM EST?

DD Summary for Logiq ($LGIQ),"**Quick Overview:**

I recently came across Logiq and was instantly intrigued by their mission to provide customer acquisition technology to small and medium-sized businesses. The current model for customer acquisition technology with other companies is based on sheer size, leaving smaller firms with no real solution. Logiq could be the answer that allows these companies to succeed against competitors of any size. I decided to do some more research into the company and figured I would share my findings with the community!

Valour Launches a Carbon-Neutral Bitcoin ETP on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange," 

**Valour has launched a carbon-neutral Bitcoin (**[**BTC**](https://crypto.news/bitcoin-price/)**) exchange-traded product (ETP) on B√∂rse Frankfurt, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The new product began trading on September 23, 2022.**

## Valour‚Äôs Carbon-Neutral Bitcoin ETP

Per the official[ press release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/valour-announces-debut-of-bitcoin-carbon-neutral-exchange-traded-product-etp-on-borse-frankfurt-301631808.html) on September 23, Valour‚Äôs carbon-neutral exchange-traded product is designed to give investors exposure to ‚Äú*sustainable and climate-friendly*‚Äù BTC while they charge a low management fee of 1.49%. The company also stressed that the new Bitcoin ETP is in tune with Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) goals.

&gt;‚ÄúValour strives to ensure that its offerings promote sustainable practices and contribute to efforts to build a carbon-neutral crypto industry. Valour CEO, Russell Starr, stated. ‚ÄúAs a proud signatory on the Crypto Climate Accord, Valour takes its ESG obligations seriously. We want to give retail and institutional investors, alike, the tools to partake in the exciting digital asset ecosystem and we are very proud to offer our first carbon neutral product.‚Äù

Valour collaborated with Patch, a provider of infrastructure for climate action, to develop the new ETP. The business has also previously collaborated with Andreessen Horowitz and other significant institutional investors.

Patch says it only selects high-integrity projects that are dedicated to lowering, eliminating, and reducing carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The firm further added that it selects projects with care and ensures that they have undergone evaluations by respected, well-known standards organizations such as Gold Standard, Climate Action Reserve, Verified Carbon Standard, BCarbon, American Carbon Registry and Puro.Earth.

## Neutralizing CO2 Emissions

According to Valour, the new carbon-neutral Bitcoin[ ETP](https://crypto.news/learn/how-to-invest-in-bitcoin-without-buying-bitcoin/) will offset its carbon emissions by funding certified carbon removal and offset initiatives. In addition to the carbon-neutral Bitcoin

ETP, Valour also offers additional ETPs. These include the Enjin (ENJ) ETP, Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), Avalanche (AVAX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Valour Binance (BNB) ETPs. It is projected that as time goes on, interest in environmentally friendly enterprises will continue to rise.

The company also talked about unveiling other products like Valour‚Äôs flagship Bitcoin Zero and Valour Ethereum Zero products, the first fully hedged, passive investment products with Bitcoin and Ether.

Despite the crypto market decline this year, there has been growing interest in crypto-related financial products.

In April 2022, DeFi Technologies, the parent company of Valour[ announced](https://crypto.news/valours-defi-etp-euronext-exchange/) that it was launching Valour‚Äôs Polkadot, Solana and Cardano ETPs on the Euronext Exchange.

More recently, in September 2022, 21 Shares[ revealed](https://crypto.news/21-shares-unveils-ethereum-etp-suited-for-crypto-winter/) plans to release an Ethereum-based exchange-traded product (ETP) called ‚Äú*Crypto Winter Suites*,‚Äù featuring Short Ethereum ETP (SHETH) and Ethereum Core ETP (CETH).

As the crypto industry continues to expand, more institutions are actively searching out ways to become environmentally sustainable in the long term. A glaring example is Ethereum‚Äôs[ migration](https://crypto.news/ethereum-merge-aftermath-can-switching-to-pos-reduce-crypto-industrys-emissions/) from the proof-of-work mechanism to the more energy-conserving proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism which makes the use of ASIC miners redundant, thereby slashing the energy consumption of the Ethereum network by an estimated 99 per cent.",manvelmamoyan,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/manvelmamoyan/comments/xn22yv/valour_launches_a_carbonneutral_bitcoin_etp_on/,,ManvelMamoyan,xn22yv,/r/manvelmamoyan/comments/xn22yv/valour_launches_a_carbonneutral_bitcoin_etp_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/manvelmamoyan/comments/xn22yv/valour_launches_a_carbonneutral_bitcoin_etp_on/,0,2022-09-24

FTD cycle/dilution theory and its effect on GME price action,"In the spirit of the weekend, I want to lay out an interesting theory I have regarding price action for GME over the past nearly two years.  As most of you are aware, there is an extremely popular theory called the ""critical margin line"" where short sellers supposedly will be squeezed if GME trades above that level for too long.  I want to present an alternate theory to this and I will call it FTD cycle/dilution theory.

&amp;#x200B;

My hypothesis is that the trendline for GME over time is a visual representation of GME being diluted, while the large spikes followed by massive drops are due to FTD cycles.

&amp;#x200B;

I came up with this theory after watching a video that has been shared on this sub numerous times, which I will link below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQvMsbb-Cw&amp;t=662s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COQvMsbb-Cw&amp;t=662s)

&amp;#x200B;

The assumption is that prime brokers locate a stock that someone is willing to lend. This can come from pension funds or anyone who is on a margin account (*aka anything NOT DRS*). The prime broker then tells numerous short sellers that it found them a locate and they can borrow it and short the stock. The prime broker is expected to deliver the stock in 3 days or it fails to deliver. During this process, the prime broker pays the lender a percentage of the fee that they made. To maximize their profits, they use an intermediary prime broker to hide the true amount that they are lending the stock for to only pay the lender a small fraction of what they should actually owe.

‚Äã

In the overnight repo market, the second prime broker stealthily sends back the cut of the profit back to the first prime broker and keeps about half. (*is this a connection to the ONRRP???*)

&amp;#x200B;

[screen cap taken from the video](https://preview.redd.it/f2h7w17gptp91.png?width=454&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b25c19625865c20958290ba1e2af939237962fa)

 

My theory is that the large drop in shares is when the locate process occurs each and every morning, then are returned to the lender as lendable shares since they already lent out necessary short shares.

‚Äã

So that is one method of how a lot of naked short shares are sold into the market using any shares that are on margin or lent by a fund (*there are more methods, but I am only covering one here*).

‚Äã

One thing that stands out is that there's nearly always shares to borrow. There are two possible scenarios in my mind as to what is happening.

1) Stocks are borrowed and held during the day as a safety net in case there is a run that is unforeseen. This sounds reasonable, but I like to look at crazier theories.

2) Stocks are borrowed and held by the short sellers, but the locates are just borrowed by another prime broker and made available the next day to X number of new short sellers to borrow and hold.

‚Äã

If scenario 2 is the case, that means that short sellers are holding onto tens or hundreds of millions of borrowed shares. Why would they want to do this??

I believe that they are holding the shares for the day where all the FTDs need to be rolled. Outside of options, there are only a limited number of ways to perpetually roll FTDs, and one of the main methods is called a timed buy-in. This is a coordinated buy-in of all shares that are FTDs, while the short sellers sell all the borrowed shares they have been hoarding into the market to bring the price back to where it started. This happens approximately every 2-3 months with GME (and not surprisingly, they time it around earnings reports a lot of the time), but the price action is a bit muted since a LOT of the FTDs are hidden in naked options...  To me, this is the reason that we continually get massive runs, followed by a day of multiple upwards then downwards halts.

[Early morning share borrow and return](https://preview.redd.it/fqsdygf5otp91.png?width=345&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eb47361e3e89e5b46b05408f5bf7e48b8b866d5)

&amp;#x200B;

Since watching only GME is a bit tunnel vision, I decided to look into a sister stock that is in the same 'basket' as GME, but which DOESN'T have options to mess around with.

 This first scenario I will show is GME. I showed arrows to very high volume days that quickly follow high volume sells, which have returned the price back to where it started each time. Obviously the volume doesn't seem crazy, but I believe that's because the additional shares traded were really only the excess that aren't hid in naked derivatives. 

[Volume chart for GME](https://preview.redd.it/ziqpojpantp91.png?width=1472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=142f7569f0e10f7049cedea282c1ef16b2d1fc94)

Meet headphone stock...

[Volume chart for headphones- why does the price start rising right as GME announces splividend??? hmmmm](https://preview.redd.it/mj6bbvhpntp91.png?width=1461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ec2a3d2b8c9c63d5c2f7c1e6b61fae4d08398fd)

So the arrows point to the exact same times as GME, but they should be unrelated and we know this second stock is heavily shorted.  This stock has a free float of less than 4.5 million shares.

[Here is the 1-day volume for the starred day around April](https://preview.redd.it/0dsyuvyqntp91.png?width=562&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95aaf0e6f9a6e5c3c1d5a1c8987d3087b8562099)

As you can see, those volume spikes are TWICE the ENTIRE FLOAT of that company.  If all the FTDs are rolled around those time periods, we can get a relatively precise guess for  just how much short interest there is.

&amp;#x200B;

The downwards slope shows dilution (at least in a macro sense, since the rest of the market is pretty wild right now)

&amp;#x200B;

As we see with GME, it doesn't really have that downwards slope... I theorize that even while the stock is constantly being diluted, more people are buying and DRSing to counteract the steady decline that they are trying to force onto us.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to also note that when the splividend was announced, price action went crazy for GME and it broke the trend of having the massive spikes followed by massive dumps.  I think this is because the SHFs were not planning on this and they couldn't coordinate their FTD cycle and it took a few extra weeks for everything to come together to dump the price again.  Because of that we are now just about due on our next run.

I theorize that in the next 1-3 weeks, we will have a run to over $40, then a day with multiple halts to return the price back down to around 30... All this is of course assuming MOASS doesn't happen in the meantime.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear thoughts and any holes you can poke in my theory!

Retiring shortly and moving: tips for managing emotions and building social connections?,"I've always dreamed of FIRE, but am getting increasingly nervous as I come closer to pulling the trigger on retiring. Recent stock market gyrations don't help.

Another source of anxiety is that my plan involves moving to a lower cost of living area. I'll have to build social connections again (and continue finding a life partner, which isn't getting easier as I'm in my 30s, and the gay dating market is much smaller than the straight market). It generally takes time to build social connections after one moves, and I'm also not sure what people will think when I introduce myself as an ""early retiree"".

Is Gap Too Far Gone?," ¬†The  once-iconic apparel company Gap and its value-tier brand, Old Navy,  are  seemingly fading into irrelevance. Can anything‚Äîor anyone‚Äîcome to  the  rescue?After Old Navy‚Äôs [head departed in April](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#), the company said Monday that Sonia Syngal, its chief executive officer, [was stepping down](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#).   The already-battered stock has fallen about 5% since the announcement.   Gap, in addition, telegraphed a worsened margin forecast for the  current  quarter, reflecting heavy discounts to manage its pile of  excess  inventory. The  missteps under Ms. Syngal‚Äôs tenure‚Äîpoor  supply-chain management and  declines at Old Navy‚Äîwere especially  surprising given her record of  success managing both when she helmed  Old Navy until 2020. ‚ÄúGap had a  very bad year in 2021, which was kind  of the best year for retailers in  modern history,‚Äù said Paul Lejuez,  equity analyst at Citigroup. ‚ÄúHalf of  my retail universe had record  margins last year, but Gap really  struggled.‚ÄùGap  is now valued at 0.19  times expected next-12-month sales, the lowest  level on record  excluding the severe dip seen in 2020. Such a low  valuation clearly  makes all options‚Äîsuch as potential spinoffs or a  sale‚Äîlook better than  nothing.While  a spinoff of Old Navy looks unpalatable, a sale or  spinoff of the  faster-growing Athleta might be a possibility. If  Athleta could fetch a  price-to-forward sales multiple that is even half  of [Lululemon](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#)‚Äôs,   its own market capitalization would surpass that of its parent  company.  Athleta‚Äôs revenue is expected to increase at a compound annual  growth  rate of 9.8% over the next five years, according to estimates  polled by  Visible Alpha. That is not a shabby number compared with  Lululemon‚Äôs  expected 14.8%There are  caveats here, though. Michael  Binetti, equity analyst at Credit Suisse,  said separation would come at  a steep cost given how integrated Gap‚Äôs  brands are, including their  supply-chain, warehousing and IT systems.  Gap is in poor shape to take  on those costs. Its cash balance hasn‚Äôt  been this low since 2001, and  its net debt burden is 6.6 times its  trailing 12-month earnings before  interest, taxes, depreciation and  amortization, according to FactSet. A  basket of apparel-company peers  has an average ratio of 1.9  times.While  a fresh set of eyes could help Gap pull off an organic  turnaround,  successful ones are rare, according to retail equity  analysts. Such  efforts typically involve a reduction of stock-keeping  units, or the  number of items the company sells, a focus mainly on the  products that  sell well year after year, and cutting off  less-profitable distribution,  Mr. Binetti said.growth rate. [Abercrombie &amp; Fitch](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#), which took its [‚Äúcool kids only‚Äù](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#)   exclusionary brand image too far under then-CEO Mike Jeffries,   recovered its margins and sales growth after an image overhaul led by   its chief merchandising officer, Fran Horowitz, who in 2017 assumed the   CEO role. The effort involved sharp cuts. As of last fiscal year, its   number of stores was about 28% smaller, and its revenue 18% below what   it was in 2012.[Victoria‚Äôs Secret](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#),   which turned customers away with its out-of-touch brand image, seems  to  be turning a corner after taking up more-inclusive messaging and   reducing its footprint. The brand operates 28% fewer U.S. stores than it   did six years ago. Similarly, [Ralph Lauren](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#)   is a much more profitable business today after the company culled the   number of items sold and reduced the number of its stores. Though stock   prices and valuations have improved for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and   Ralph Lauren since their respective downturns, they aren‚Äôt where they   used to be.One  problem for Gap is that the company has already used up  some of its  downsizing ammunition‚Äîwith little success. The Gap brand in  particular  has reduced the number of its stores since 2018, but  same-store sales  have still declined or looked anemic. While   Victoria‚Äôs Secret and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch had clear branding   problems, at least their names were eliciting some conversation, and   inclusive messaging worked wonders for both of those brands, Neither Gap   nor Old Navy has an easily diagnosable brand problem. Rather, they  lack  brand identity altogether.Ms.  Syngal frequently said that Gap  stands for American optimism. Nothing  would be more on-brand than a  true pulling itself up by its bootstraps  turnaround, but that doesn‚Äôt  make it a sure thing.For more info visit [https://stockxpo.com/is-gap-too-far-gone/](https://www.blogger.com/u/1/#)

Zigbee protocol -  Operates within the 2.4, 900 and 868 ghz range and is an adopted standard that operation in the IEEE 802.15.4 radio specification

**2020** \- Zwave Alliance joins the CSA as a member -

Zwave protocol -  Operates within the sub 1Ghz frequency - 908.42Mhz  and provides 40 to 100kbs speeds

**My observations**:

a.  Stock prices for the 3 big tech companies increase significantly upon the alliance announcement.

b.  Matter will operate at the wireless IP layer, still giving it access to the internet with some vendor or cloud integration (Is the Zigbee protocol therefore replaced with something new)??

c.  With the best security model in the industry, why would the zwave alliance join this consortium of players when they have a significant portion of the professional market share with security companies globally and a similar share with consumer product manufacturers ?

d.  What's the difference in using ""Matter"" versus vendor open standard, i.e, vendors allowing their tech to work with others without a new protocol ?  Based on what I'm reading from the CSA and other reviewing standards groups, vendor's will still have Brand Lock-in even with the inclusion of a zigbee (Matter) standard in their technology.

1.  Vendor devices will still have the ability to connect to cloud services

2.  Security at the local level will presumably improve however that over the net connectivity will introduce vulnerabilities as always to multiple protocol ingress points

3.  The new protocal will introduce a new mechanism for identity and security, but zigbee and Zwave already do this today.

When this alliance was first announced, I recall specifically Google and Apple indicating it was to compete directly with Zwave technology overall market share, now the Zwave alliance is a partner.

e.  The three big tech companies do not have a good track record of security, privacy and sees user data as a monetized investment.  Offer cheap products based on a sense of security, privacy and standards, while on the back end profit taking of that data and weakening the security footprint.

Yes, you may have gathered that I'm very cynical of the prospect of a new protocol or technology that seeks to ""change the world"", where it may inevitably be just another marketing researched approach to getting the consumer to aimlessly click YES to privacy notices without knowing the consequences.

But more than that, I'm concerned that something like this makes its way into the Open Source community whereby systems like HA and others latch on to this endeavor opening up to ""back door"" entry of their security model.

I'll continue to read and view the CSA's progress and determine as things progress whether this protocol improves or weakens overall security and privacy, but I must say, seeing so many reliable companies jump on this bandwagon as a significant breakthrough in the IoT space is alarming.  Am I worried that the network hardware provider becomes locked into this protocol ?  YES I am, which now provides an additional gateway into my home technology.

I think many platform owners such as HA sees the writing on the wall that the next big thing, happening right now, is the space around IoT and home Automation.  Right now it's a frantic pace I'm seeing where new products are starting to spring up everywhere, which makes it even more important for the Big Giants to jump in deeper than just focusing on Brand attraction.   Although many have maintained that they have some significant solutions in this IoT space, I believe they realized they cornered themselves in their Brand and are at a crossroads on whether they can continue to be viable in the space over time.  There are so many Open Source projects that will impact their solutions over time in the voice control market, IoT control and more, it makes sense that they'd try to corner a new something in this space.

This is only meant to start a conversation around what's happening in the industry and I am no where near the expert in this, but I value your thoughts!",homeassistant,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/xn00au/matter_i_cant_find_a_subreddit_out_there_that/,Blog,isitallfromchina,xn00au,/r/homeassistant/comments/xn00au/matter_i_cant_find_a_subreddit_out_there_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/xn00au/matter_i_cant_find_a_subreddit_out_there_that/,0,2022-09-24
"How to ""invest"" in this market?","Hi everyone, 

I keep hearing stocks are basically ""on sale"" right now and ""now's the time to buy"" etc, and I have money to invest. BUT I invested in individual stocks about 2 years ago and lost half of it so I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to investing. 

My 401k is in like a generic ""retire in 2050"" account and i was wondering if there's a type of thing like that in the stock market? 

Or in general I guess what I'm looking for is - if you had money to ""invest"" right now, where would you put it? 

And one other question - I do have an investment account with a fiduciary but there are small fees associated with that. Would it be smart to just give the money to her? Or is there a way to do this on my own without paying a fee?

THANK YOU!",personalfinance,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/xn07hu/how_to_invest_in_this_market/,Investing,FelixFelicis23,xn07hu,/r/personalfinance/comments/xn07hu/how_to_invest_in_this_market/,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/xn07hu/how_to_invest_in_this_market/,1,2022-09-24
Is the FUD getting to you? Here is some absolute moonboy hopium charts to make you feel better,"Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) is incredibly high nowadays. The Fear &amp; Greed Index is pretty much stuck at the extreme fear level. This makes sense: Inflation is soaring, there is war in Europe, currencies are quickly losing value, energy prices are skyrocketing, stocks are deep in the red, and our beloved cryptocurrencies are down over 70%. The bearish sentiment is so bad that the demand for shorts in stocks is at all time high, even though the key stock indices like the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are near/at support right now (200 weekly MA + low of 2022).

Do you need a pick me up? Do you need to remember what that beautiful bull market felt like? You have come to the right place. I scavenged the internet for some of the most hopium inducing charts that can help you feel a little better. Here they are.

"$BIG Big Lots is the best opportunity to wring out hedge funds in this market after they have over borrowed shares. It‚Äôs a better bet than $AMC $GME or $BBBY due to its lower float, lower market cap, lower daily volume &amp; off the radar status. It has everything to become the next WSB news story","What do you look for when looking for the opportunity to jump in and buy call options for a massive gamma move in a heavily borrowed stock?

Low float? $BIG has a much lower float than any of the favorites $AMC $GME $BBBY that have become legendary.

Low daily trading volume? At an average volume of only 1.2 million shares traded, $BIG wins this one hands down. Big moves can be created here.

Off the radar? No one is talking about Big Lots. Just like they never talked about $GME $AMC or $BBBY but $BIG is extremely high on the hedge fund hit list. (#6 as of Friday‚Äôs close)

Cheap out of the money call options? How about those $30 OCT 21 CALLS for 5/10 cents with almost 10,000 open interest? What would happen if this were to suddenly have 100,000 open interest? üöÄ 

Best of all, how about a good underlying business? $BIG pays a fat 6.5% dividend with a positive PE ratio unlike any of the other WSB favorites. This company sells close out stuff at a heavy discount and does very well in a recession.

Starting capital to trade $SPY Option,"I've been consistently profitable swing trading $SPY for a few years already and want to jump with options. I'll be paper trading for 1 year but thinking how much should be the starting capital. 

If I understand it correctly, if $SPY current market price is $350. I would need at least 100 x $350 = $35k to open and exercise an option? So adding a losing buffer of $10k, ideally trading $SPY option would require $45k?

Is this calculation correct? I would like to trade $SPY than  a specific stock since I already knew its market behavior on different conditions.

"Historic sell-off in bonds shows how the investor mood has darkened - We've entered the ""Third Great Bond Bear Market""","**Markets are coming to terms with the scale of central bank tightening of monetary policy**

**This week has demonstrated, as if it were not already obvious, that declines in asset market valuations are simply not going away**. In an extraordinary sweep, central banks from the US to Switzerland embarked on what looked like competitive policy tightening.

Fred Ducrozet at Pictet Wealth Management totted up the numbers and found that **10 central banks delivered a massive combined total of 6 percentage points of rate rises just this week.** Several rises, including the latest from the US, were of some 0.75 percentage points, three times the usual scale of rate moves. As Pimco economist Tiffany Wilding put it, ‚Äú75 is the new 25‚Äù.¬†

Doing the most damage, for equity investors at least, the US Federal Reserve has turned up the volume on its warnings on just how much further it is prepared to go.  **No more sugar coating ‚Äî Fed chair Jay Powell was clear that further rate rises are coming and that they will involve ‚Äúpain‚Äù**. He was referring mostly to pain in labour markets but the same is true of your rapidly shrinking equities portfolio.

Stock markets got the message. The US S&amp;P 500 fell by 1.7 per cent on Wednesday after Powell‚Äôs speech, taking losses for the year to more than 20 per cent.¬†

But still, it looks like investors are clinging on to some key bets. This is getting dicey. As Bank of America notes, **the drop in government bonds stemming from sky-high inflation and aggressively hawkish central banks is now in truly historic territory**.

Looking at data stretching as far back as 1790 (not a typo ‚Äî banks just love super long-term data for moments like these), BofA **describes this as the third Great Bond Bear Market.** We have seen nothing like it **since at least the Marshall Plan in 1949,** wrote Michael Hartnett and colleagues at the bank.¬†

That is striking in itself but it matters well beyond the bond market, because the crash ‚Äúthreatens credit events and the liquidation of the world‚Äôs most crowded trades‚Äù, they said, **including US tech stocks, which of course have an outsized impact on US and global stock market shifts. ‚ÄúTrue capitulation is when investors sell what they love and own,‚Äù** they added. This axiom has been worth repeating several times this year, and this week is no exception. Investors still have scope to throw in the towel.

Period for Almost 2 Years,"I started investing in stocks nearing the end of 2020. I saw my portfolio increase in early 2021 but I never actually made profits from it because I didn't sell any of my stocks. Instead, I hold it. As I was holding it, I was starting to make losses. I didn't sell any of my stocks during that time too because I was telling to myself ""diamond hands only."" ""it will get better"" ""I'm sure I will see greens again after a few months"". SIKEEE the market got worse. I stopped and I removed the broker app, the stock app, yahoo finance app from my home screen because it was painful to watch and I was getting busy with my studies. it has been almost 2 years and today, I decided to check on my portfolios and boyyy oh boyyyyy... I really took a huge deep breath. it's still as red as ever...

I'm not a pro in investing and I feel like im the only one who has had her portfolio having period for almost 2 years. idk. i need some optimism, some light into this. :(",investing_discussion,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/xmn72n/period_for_almost_2_years/,,ElderberryRemote6123,xmn72n,/r/investing_discussion/comments/xmn72n/period_for_almost_2_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/xmn72n/period_for_almost_2_years/,0,2022-09-24

Are Animators &amp; Small Studios Doomed? (*with the increase in automated/easy video creation tools and AI advances.),"Hey,  


I thought it would be interesting to discuss the future animation industry and see what others think about the recent rise in easy-to-use video creation software (squarely aimed at businesses and individuals). Plus the ever improving AI art creation tools.  


This is not actually meant to be a doomsday discussion. As I think there's a secure future for animators and all the creative disciplines involved in animation production but its hard to ignore advancements in software that directly impact the animation production world and our careers.

**Easy to use software:**  
Over the past couple of years there's been a real rise in online based (and desktop apps) that make it easy for 'non-creatives' to create pretty good-looking animated video content quickly and very cheaply. (\*Yes, essentially using templates or placeing stock materials and characters... but they're getting more and more customisable and easy to work with.)  


I'm about to check out CreateStudio Pro, and will probably make a video about it. Hopefully, (fingers crossed) I'll be able to highlight why quality, bespoke creatives, design and animation (the likes our own animation studio creates) is still going to be needed for a long, long, long time to come.  


But for small companies or individuals looking to create some content easily for their low or no-budget business idea to share something professional and quickly on their social media channels. Then the recent crop of 'easy-to-use animated video creation software' is already starting to steal that market. Taking opportunities that may have come to new animators (and small studios) trying to break into the industry and gain that early experience and earn some ¬£$‚Ç¨. (\*But of course, you could use that easy software yourself and make a few bucks offering the video creation on the likes of Fivver.. but I don't think that would scratch the creative itch nor provide the satisfaction of creating a bespoke piece of animation).  


**AI Software:**  
To, date I've not seen any ***great*** Artificial Intelligence animation creation software, but it's definitely a case of 'when' not 'if'.   


Tools, like the AI still image creation site Mid Journey, are seriously incredible. Just check out their community showcase to see what's being achieved by simply using the right words to describe the kind of imagery you want to create. [https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/](https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/).  It's enough to make you give up and retrain as a plumber :-D.  


At the moment, I can see how the likes of Mid Journey, can be a really useful tool to help with inspiration, mood board creation, and just as another bag of tricks for a creative to work with. Plus, it's just plain fun. It can certainly aid the animation production process, although, does that put some designers/creatives out of a job already whilst making others and the business as a whole more efficient?

There's also been music videos, feature film scripts, film editing and song creation achieved successfully by AI systems. Even the fake AI driven voiceover artists are getting pretty damn impressive. (\*Although I'd appreciate it if the adverts would stop following me around Youtube.. I'm not going to buy it!!).  


Even our phones are incredibly smart. The recent Googles Pixel phones let you click and (near seamlessly) remove people or items from a photo. The new Apple iOS 16 update lets you tap and hold on the subject in a photo (even those not taken with the iPhone camera) and it will be instantly be masked out from the background and copied so you can use the image on a transparent layer, paste it into a message, make a sticker etc...   (\*As someone who's done a fair bit of rotoscoping over the years, using the marquee tool in photoshop or rotobrush in After Effects. This is an AI advancement I'm hugely in favour of.  


**The Future?**

Personally, I'm confident that the sort of service our own animation studio provides will be required for a long time. We're a small creative team, continuing to produce high-quality, mid-budget animation for businesses. Working through script, storyboarding, creating 2D/3D assets and making 100,000,000 small creative decisions and tackling lots of rounds of review with multiple tiers of clients, and meetings to deliver a final short video for a business or campaign. We'll often meet clients in person (or over a video call) , build up a working relationship, understand and interpret what they'd like, plus share our skills and experience). Ya de ya de ya.....  


But... admittedly it also feels inevitable that to remain competitive for either price, speed or quality. We will slowly integrate AI into our creative production process over the coming years. Both to speed up and improve certain processes.   


Perhaps we will eventually get to a point where AI creates the first draft of an animation (hand-drawn, 3D or vector art), working with specific brand docs, given business goals, target audience descriptions and an art style plus an AI-written (and client-approved) script. Then our remote working 'actuall living breathing human hipster creatives' go through, and create the finer decisions, simply using descriptive words which trigger near instant changes to the visuals, characters and more. Hmmm..   the 'human creatives' can be sitting on a sunny beach with a cocktail, so it at least sounds less dystopian.  


**What do you think?**

Are there areas of the animation industry that will always avoid the march of the creative AI gods?  


Will it only be positive, with more and better work being created?  


If it brings down production costs, allows more creative ideas to be pursued and improves quality is it something to embrace as soon as possible?  


Will we all have more time and the ability to bring our own creative personal projects to life?  


Is there something we/you/everyone could be doing to make the most of it right now?  


Are we all doomed?   \*Happy Saturday!!  :-D",animationcareer,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/xmr38l/are_animators_small_studios_doomed_with_the/,Career question,stormy3000,xmr38l,/r/animationcareer/comments/xmr38l/are_animators_small_studios_doomed_with_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/animationcareer/comments/xmr38l/are_animators_small_studios_doomed_with_the/,0,2022-09-24

"IS TOP SHIPS, TOPS, DOWN 90% YONY, UP 1,900% ON DAY, OR DOWN 50%?"," 

#### Key points:

* Top Ships is up 1,900% so far today
* Or, we can say down 5%, or even down 50% in 24 hours
* Which are we more interested in, real or nominal prices?

Top Ships (NASDAQ: TOPS) stock price is all over the place and we can variously describe it as down 90% over the past 12 months, up 1,900% today premarket, or even down 50% in the past 24 hours. All of those numbers are true for a given definition of truth. Which is one of those little difficulties we always have ‚Äì that differentiation between real and nominal numbers. The point being that it‚Äôs only changes in real valuations and prices which make us money ‚Äì changes in nominal prices can confuse but they‚Äôre not profitable.

Top Ships runs oil tankers and that‚Äôs, in itself, something of a little tale. Sure, it‚Äôs a small company, 1.4 million deadweight tonnes in the fleet, 5 Suezmax, two VLCCs and a few much smaller vessels. That the stock price has been falling so badly at a time of a booming tanker market isn‚Äôt all that great a sign to be honest. That massive change to which oil goes where as a result of sanctions we might think should have boosted matters.

The effect of that 90% TOPS stock price fall though is that it has fallen below the NASDAQ $1 minimum offer price rule. So, something must be done and something has been done. There‚Äôs been a reverse stock split ‚Äì a consolidation to Brits. Here simply that what used to be 20 pieces of stock is now one. A 20 for one reverse split that is. This should not change ‚Äì not directly at least ‚Äì the market capitalisation of the company nor the value of any individual holding. It just changes the number of pieces of paper that make up that holding or capitalisation. 

So, we‚Äôve a 20 for 1 reverse stock split and the price rise should be 2,000%. But it is only that 1,900%, so we could say that TOPS is 5% down on the action. But that would be to miss the slightly earlier period. TOPS also fell 9 cents yesterday, for a 44% fall. So, a better valuation over 24 hours would be that Top Ships is down some 50%. Which, as a response to an action to keep the NASDAQ quotation is really pretty bad.

As to why such reverse stock splits this is entirely fashion. The New York markets just think ‚Äì for whatever reason ‚Äì that a solid and dependable stock should be in the $10 to $100 range. That this is just fashion is shown by London‚Äôs similar range being ¬£1 to ¬£10. This is why ADRs of London stocks are so often 10 pieces of the London stock ‚Äì to be in that ‚Äúgood‚Äù price range on both markets.

NASDAQ and the NYSE also seem to think that penny stocks are the preserve of rogues and charlatans ‚Äì so, penny price stocks lose their listings on those markets. In order to retain the listing something must be done ‚Äì the reverse stock split.

It is fair to say though that it‚Äôs unusual for a reverse stock split which then retains a NASDAQ listing to cause a 50% real value loss. TOPs has managed that and Hurrah! for TOPS really.",asktraders12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktraders12/comments/xmtt4e/is_top_ships_tops_down_90_yony_up_1900_on_day_or/,,Asktraders178,xmtt4e,/r/asktraders12/comments/xmtt4e/is_top_ships_tops_down_90_yony_up_1900_on_day_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktraders12/comments/xmtt4e/is_top_ships_tops_down_90_yony_up_1900_on_day_or/,0,2022-09-24

"Long Term Investment, Alts and Future Exchanges"," 

So I see a lot of talk nowadays about how ‚Äúenchants should be the last thing you focus on‚Äù, and to be honest, I just do not agree with this statement. Some may recall me from the days of old when I produced Warlock builds and guides, some probably think ‚Äúwho?‚Äù This doesn‚Äôt mean I am right in what I think, but let me explain my line of thought on why upgrading enchants is more important than people seem to think.  
So I also work on music production as a hobby and as a side hustle, and when doing so I employ the ‚Äútop down‚Äù approach in dealing with a track. My first steps when making a mix begin at the main ‚Äúmastering‚Äù bus, I want to make the track sound as good as I can right off the bat. Then I work down to the group bus tracks: drum bus, bass bus, synth bus etc. I finish by adding effects and polish to the individual tracks before exporting a copy and then working on the final master. Every step I take is about reaching the endgame in as few a steps as possible. (you could argue someone intending to play one toon could do so without taking the steps I am about to describe, but let‚Äôs be honest, with a slim game population, our belief that we will not utilise alts in day to day play is sadly misguided).

So, how does this relate to Neverwinter, or MMORPGs? Well in this case my main bus is my account, my drum/bass/synth busses are my tank/healer/dps roles, and my individual tracks/channels are my toons.  
This game is built around vertical ""theme park"" progression. New strong items come in every mod (IL increases and the such) and generally they are superseded by new items in one or two mods. They do not bring value to my account nor are they long term items, since they usually end up character bound and/or being outdated relatively quickly. They are always transitory and should really be the last thing that people worry about. Sadly the game is built to encourage us to ‚Äúchase‚Äù these items despite them having no long term value, but they offer short term gains, and if you have played the stock market, boy those short term, get rich quick, high dividend yield stocks seem tempting don‚Äôt they? You gotta chase them, or you‚Äôll miss out right now!!!

Let‚Äôs flip it around and think about long term investment, what brings the most value to your account? Well, everyone always talks about mount and companion bolster being a great impact for your account, which I agree with. These Mythic account unlocks make your account not just class fluid, but role fluid. Should the meta change, you always have that max Companion and Mount Bolster to fall back on. It gives you a great head start on a new toon and makes your transitions easier.  
Mythic enchants should be the next logical step from there. Yes, they take a significant amount of investment, but the investment increases your account‚Äôs value even further. Garnets, Jade and Cobalt are great for DPS, tanks and heals, all of this before considering class‚Äô fortes and how that interacts or how you decide to build your toon in your own way.  


Currently I have (at Mythic level): 8 Garnets, 4 Cobalts, 4 Jades, 1 Poisoned Thorn, 1 Flash Freeze, 1 Fortified Nature, 1 Companion Enchantment, 1 Movement, 1 Recharge and 1 Action. I have plans to make 1 Cursed Burn, 2 Amethyst and 2 Citrine. Why? Same reason you upgrade your PC ahead of the need to: future-proofing. Long term investment.  
Right now I can build a new toon and they can have a considerable Ilvl and stat bump from some simple early investment in long term items. This is why I always find it incredible when people suggest new players charge headlong into the newest content for short term gains, or individual channel mixing. It is short term and short sighted. Surely enough of us veterans have been around long enough to see the fluctuations and tell new players to invest not just their AD, but their time wisely.  
I will end this rant/essay on a final statement/question that I think the community should echo/be on board with:  
Endgame is enriched by players having more toons at an endgame content stage. Players can explore a plethora of options at endgame easily, keeping them entertained and playing. The Mythic Enchant exchange did wonders for the viability of alts, probably one of the best shifts toward an alt friendly lifestyle in a long time. Mythic Insignia are a Herculean grind. Since the framework already exists, are there any plans to introduce a Mythic Insignia exchange as well? At this point in the game there is no reason for such a function not to exist  
TL:DR - Long term investment good. Long term is anything that becomes or is account bound, and of high quality. Short term investment bad. Short term is anything to do with gear that comes from a mod.  
PS: Mythic Insignia Exchange now!.........please?",Neverwinter,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/xmelhj/long_term_investment_alts_and_future_exchanges/,,SamgoFandango,xmelhj,/r/Neverwinter/comments/xmelhj/long_term_investment_alts_and_future_exchanges/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/xmelhj/long_term_investment_alts_and_future_exchanges/,0,2022-09-24

[Of those we made]-Chapter one: New London,"T.B.P.U-47 (simply known as ‚ÄòTea‚Äô by his human counterparts) was walking down the streets of New London. New London was still simply London, but eventually, the so-called ‚Äògreen belt‚Äô caved away under the pressure of the so-called ‚Äòmodernity‚Äô and ‚Äòprogress‚Äô of the new era. New London, thus, was the name of the area where the urban sprawl expanded out, like the creeping tentacles of an octopus, squid or some other unknown creature of the depths. 

Tea was a police drone, or ‚ÄòTactical British Police Unit 47‚Äô, whose official designation was to ‚Äòprotect and serve the Great British police and public in all capacity and uphold the laws of this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland‚Äô. He was even the latest model. His facial unit was the sleek, flat 94K model from Kol&amp;Co, which promised an authoritative look, without the uncomfortable human likeness. His body, under the specially designed uniform, was also the face of modernity and had large hydraulics in crossing patterns that could be seen laboriously pushing against each other to move his limbs.    

Tea was walking through New London‚Äôs rain-soaked streets, large puddles forming due to ineffectual drainage systems that New Londoners always complaint about 

‚ÄúUp to my ankle last week, Carrie!‚Äù

‚ÄúThe government really needs to do som‚Äôin! Liberal-Labour ain‚Äôt gonna do noth‚Äôin, I tell you that now!‚Äù

Tea never really cared for the gossip of Londoners. He thought it silly how they complained about everything when they really had nothing to complain about, they have everything, he thought, and they never seemed to notice or care. However, once this was said to a New Londoner, a long list of complaints would waft in the air like a never-ending story of neglect and grievances. 

The neon blue and pink lights of the grubby bars and clubs shon on him, sparkling and swimming on the rain-soaked ‚ÄòKrane artificial leather‚Äô of his uniform and the titanium of his bodywork. Being a police drone created a relatively easy off-duty life for a robot, Tea always thought, all of the humans parted way for you, they treated you with a semblance of respect (unlike they did with most other robots) and him being 9ft tall was always useful. 

As the neon lights performed their swan dance on the beads of rain running down his police tunic,  tea turned down the street to Johnson Station, the old high-speed underground service that hadn‚Äôt been renovated in over 35 years. Nearly derelict and always filthy, the station had been designated for Robots after the so-called ‚ÄòRobot Rights Act‚Äô and the ‚ÄòRobot Transportation Act for the movement of undesirables‚Äô 

Feet echoing down the busy alleyways and streets, he walked towards the large entrance to the station which looked like a mouth ready to swallow you whole. The ancient LED lights were flickering loudly and casting a green, dingy light across the grubby station floor. 

The station was littered with rubbish, a lot of human food left behind by riotous teenagers who liked to laugh at L4K (popularly known as ‚ÄòLa Fork-e‚Äô because of his Spanish make), the janitor robot for the station whose gears would grind with neglect and decay. 

Tea always felt sorry for L4K, he had been a hero of the ‚ÄòFace Purge‚Äô, helping Facers escape London where they would often go to Scandinavia or some uninhabited Scottish islands. L4K would often be the one who would hide the facers and get them on trains when he was a Civil Service Robot and had access to money, corrupt politicians, and resources. Once he was found out, he was reprogrammed, reconstructed with old parts, and told to sweep.

‚ÄúGood afternoon L4K‚Äù, Tea bleeped 

‚ÄúMerry Halloween, hope your egg hunt goes well‚Äù L4K replied 

Tea didn‚Äôt know why he had bothered. L4K never really replied properly after the reprogramming, in fact, he could hardly clean anymore- the last revenge of the humans. Tea left L4K to sweep the heap of cola bottle lids, which he kept pushing away from him then back to him, and walked down to the ticket booth.

There, another facer collaborator lay. His bottom half had been removed and his torso, arms, and head, had been connected to a large metal box that was bolted to the floor. 

‚ÄúHay T.B.P.U-47‚Äù he sighed ‚Äúanything new?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think 9s‚Äù Tea beeped ‚Äúanother case, a robot this time at least, finally taking robot murder seriously, I hope‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, they only do that to keep you happy,‚Äù 9s said coyly 

‚ÄúNo they don‚Äôt- they don‚Äôt think we have emotions‚Äù Tea mumbled back in a half-pitying way

‚ÄúAh well,‚Äù 9s said, waving a large hand in the air that was once used for rescue operations at home and abroad, lifting rubble from collapsed buildings ‚Äúwe‚Äôll outlive them anyway and they‚Äôll eventually come around‚Äù

‚ÄúEventually,‚Äù Tea said, anger tones activating in his vocaliser ‚Äúcan not come soon enough‚Äù 

Tea passed his holo tab to 9s who opened the gate to let Tea pass. As he thanked 9s he turned sideways to squeeze himself passed the far too small entrance and was on his way.

He could already hear the train coming into the station as he clanked down the cracked stairs, making the cockroaches scatter as if they were ducking for cover from the Blitz. As he came down he was greeted by many of the other robots there, some construction, recycling, sewage, accountant, and stock market advisors (really stock market riggers) who were waiting too. 

As the train stopped a flood of metal came washing forth from the train, all dirty and all babbling quietly, culminating in a crescendo as they walked past.

The train had the same sickly green LED light as the station did, only that in the claustrophobic train its dazzling green light seemed to claw to every surface, making the train look like it was covered in moss or modo. Along the wall were metal seats, reinforced to take the weight of the robots, and a  luggage rack made up of a criss-cross of metal wire. As he took this in he noticed the other robots around him. One was listening to some form of music, bobbing his head up and down wearing two large headphone disks that attached to his head. Another was reading the holo newspapers without looking up and a third was looking out of the window (even though nothing could be seen).

What really made him look was the fourth robot. He was a facer, or at least an early facer. He had a sleek, human-like appearance. His body was a smooth white carbon fiber that had small gaps between the limbs and the neck revealing the mechanisms underneath. His arms and legs too had a similar appearance and his head were also smooth and round. 

The only way this facer could have possibly survived was due to him being an old model. The facers purged had a flush white carbon fiber body that could effortlessly flex and the jaws moved as they spoke. Their eyes could dart in an uncanny way like a human and their faces could move to show emotion. This unsettled humans who still liked to think of the robots as *theirs*. *Things*.*Possessions*. The idea that robots could think for themselves, could feel for themselves, meaning that owning a robot was tantamount to slavery and the look also made humans uncomfortable, nothing, in their eyes, should look so human but be so completely not. Thus the recall was announced. 

Tea could not help himself from looking at this facer that somehow got away. He could stare without being noticed due to the Kol&amp;Co 94k head as its face was a flat black plastic at a slanting edge that covered his facial peace. Thanks to this he could look all he wanted to, even though he knew he shouldn‚Äôt, but there was no way he could not look, it was a rare sight, almost as rare as the thumbs on the facer‚Äôs hands. Not many robots had thumbs- that was too human. Tea had thumbs purely to use his gun, but he also had eight fingers that made his hand distinctively non-human. Whilst the official reason his police model had eight fingers were for extra gripping strength, this was rubbish. Better hydraulics did this.

‚ÄúSo, why ya here?‚Äù

The question snapped Tea back to reality. He had been utterly ‚Äòzoned out‚Äô to use the human term and hadn‚Äôt noticed whoever was talking to him

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù he said confused as he looked around him. He couldn‚Äôt see anyone. No one sat next to him or across from him. Headphones were still listening to music, the facer still fidgeting and the other still reading. As he went to look at the robot looking at the window he heard 

‚ÄúUp here, genius!‚Äù

Tea‚Äôs head shot up to its full extent to see a Mouz-Bot. Mouz-Bots were the German answer to the CANZUK-American Facer robots. Mouz-Bots were smaller, two or four ft tall robots with a semi-human face. It had obvious eyepieces and its mouth was one semicircle that fell open like a cut underside of a tin can. They were rolled out across the EU but couldn‚Äôt keep up with Facers. Their small size enabled them to get into small work areas but this never caught on. Not even when the facers were recalled and replaced with the modern faceless robots did the Mouz-Bot catch on.

‚ÄúThere we go,‚Äù the Mouz said as Tea looked up at him ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs ya name?‚Äù

‚ÄúT.B.P.U-47‚Äù Tea replied in a monotone beep

‚ÄúWell, I ain't calling you that!‚Äù the Mouz giggled. 

‚ÄúGreat‚Äù, Tea thought. Mouz-Bots we‚Äôre notorious for preferring names to their model numbers like any other sane robot

‚ÄúThey call me Tea‚Äù, Tea grumbled 

‚ÄúTea!‚Äù he yelled out cackling ‚ÄúTEA!‚Äù. Now the other bots were looking up with disdain at the little robot who was rolling along his luggage rack and kicking the floor ‚ÄúBy the maker! How British are your owners! My name Lidson, pleasure to meet ya‚Äù

‚ÄúLikewise‚Äù Tea lied

Hedge fund stock market corruption. When do we say enough is enough,"   This does not only pertain to CVM (Cel-Sci). Citadel, who recently bragged about how many transactions they had in one day and for the year and thought we would be impressed. Not one bit. Especially when half of those transactions are synthetic. Meaning they are adding shares to the stock. Only the company is legally allowed to do so. Everyone thinks the stock market is crashing because of Inflation. No, no, and no. It is failing because nearly every stock has millions of shares added to it. Only these Market Makers know how much. This lowers the price per share. Failed to deliver. Guess who benefits? the hedge funds shorting the stock. This is not capitalism. It is corruption and tyranny. 

  These ""MM's"" (Market Manipulators) think the stock market wouldn't work without them using shares that are not located. Wow. Who knows how many shares this stock, or any stock, actually has.  


  They think that millions of people thinking they own shares but actually do not, is plausible? Of course, they would. They are the only ones that benefit. ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ Claiming it would be ""too difficult"". That is their reasoning. None of this makes a lick of logic.  


  Having billions of dollars, you would assume would be a big enough of an advantage. Do we think they should continue to be allowed to ""print"" shares? Only the company has the right to add shares, no? Hmmm.  


  Illegal, Immoral, and yet no action?  
This has nothing to do with getting rid of the function of shorting. It's as simple as locating it. If you cannot find it than it does not exist. If it does not yet exist, it does not get traded. These fools are trying to justify their illegal way of ruining companies and making billions of dollars with ""It's too hard"".  


  4/19/22---- 48 million volume day and the price ONLY rises from 3 to 6 dollars? HAHAHA.  For comparison, on 1/27/21 (CVM stock's best single day) there was 14 million volume and the price jumped from $14.25 to $40.00 dollars. They are undermining the whole system by dictating how many shares a stock has and being the only ones that really know. G-A-R-B-A-G-E.  48 million volume and it falls below what it started at. Especially when it is on the Hard-to-Borrow list. In fact, it is impossible. The only way it could be possible is to add millions upon millions of shares that do not exist. 

  We now know what that day was all about. Clear as day when it was all centered around one little tweet from Adam Feuerstein. The analyst that gives recommendations for selling stocks and Citadel so happens to short every one of them. The same Adam Feuerstein who has attacked Cel-Sci for the past 14 years has insider information on the company? Please. Nice easy way to cover the 9 million shares. Add millions more shares and not the money.

"[September 23, 2022] Novavax Nuvaxovid Vaccination in San Francisco Experiences","I just got vaccinated with Novavax Nuvaxovid (original, not bivalent) shot #1 in San Francisco at UCSF Laurel Heights medical center yesterday (September 23), and thought I would post about my experiences, since perhaps someone might find this to be useful. A lot of the information I found on the web is incorrect or outdated, and some of this information doesn't seem to be posted anywhere else.

# tl;dr

I highly recommend UCSF as a vaccination site, it was very efficient and relatively painless, but you should make an appointment online and ask for Novavax explicitly.

For other vaccination locations, check [https://www.solvhealth.com/ca/c/san-francisco-ca-srv-covid-vaccine?filter=novavax](https://www.solvhealth.com/ca/c/san-francisco-ca-srv-covid-vaccine?filter=novavax) or  [https://novavax-finder.github.io/#/ca/all?inStockOnly=true](https://novavax-finder.github.io/#/ca/all?inStockOnly=true) and call to confirm availability.

# Confirmed Novavax Vaccination Sites:

**By Online Appointment - Confirmed Available By Phone**

\- UCSF Mission Bay (3333 California St): (415) 476-3307

\- UCSF Laurel Heights (601 16th St): (415) 476-3307

For the UCSF sites, you need to ask for Novavax specifically, even some of the staff don't know that it is available. [https://coronavirus.ucsf.edu/vaccines](https://coronavirus.ucsf.edu/vaccines)

They have walk-in appointments, but you can schedule an appointment using MyChart as well. I scheduled by calling their phone number: (415) 476-3307

&amp;#x200B;

**By Appointment - Unknown Availability**

Safeway Pharmacy

* Alameda (2227 South Shore Center, Alameda): shows Novavax available on [https://www.solvhealth.com/ca/c/san-francisco-ca-srv-covid-vaccine?filter=novavax](https://www.solvhealth.com/ca/c/san-francisco-ca-srv-covid-vaccine?filter=novavax) but not available at [https://www.safeway.com/vaccinations/home](https://www.safeway.com/vaccinations/home)

&amp;#x200B;

**By Appointment**

\- South Of Market Health Center (229 7th St):  (415) 503-6000 ext 0

\- Kaiser Pharmacy 2675 Geary Blvd: (866) 454-8855

\- \[FAR\] Safeway: [https://www.safeway.com/vaccinations/home](https://www.safeway.com/vaccinations/home). The nearest sites with Novavax according to their website are:

* Walnut Creek, CA (600 South Broadway)

* Palo Alto, CA (2811 Middlefield Rd)
* Petaluma, CA (389 S. McDowell Blvd)
* Napa, CA (3375 Jefferson Street)
* Santa Clara, CA (3970 Rivermark Plaza)

\- \[FAR\] Sutter Health: the nearest location with Novavax in stock is Santa Rosa in Marin County.

&amp;#x200B;

**By Online Appointment - Confirmed Not In Stock By Phone**

\- Costco 450 10th Street(currently not in stock but they expect a new shipment next week)

&amp;#x200B;

**Not Available to General Public - Confirmed By Phone**

\- North East Medical Service Stockton Clinic (1520 Stockton St): Called their phone number at (415) 391-9686, they have Novavax in stock, but you need to be an NEMS member to make an appointment.

&amp;#x200B;

**Drop-In**

[https://sf.gov/get-vaccinated-against-covid-19](https://sf.gov/get-vaccinated-against-covid-19) lists the following Public Health sites:

\- Southeast Health Center 2401 Keith Street Tues-Sat from 9am-5pm (drop-in)

\- 1099 Sunnydale Ave Mondays 9:30-4:30 pm (drop-in)

\- Ella Hill Hutch, 1181 Golden Gate, Weds and Sat, 10am to 5:30pm (drop-in)

\- I.T. Bookman Center, 446 Randolph Street, Fridays 9am to 4pm and 1st and 3rd Saturdays each month 10am to 2:30pm (drop-in)

&amp;#x200B;

These are all drop-in, you might need to wait in line if you go during a peak hour (weekends or evenings).

&amp;#x200B;

SF General Hospital: Building 30 (1001 Potrero Ave) has all US-manufactured vaccines, however their website states: ""The San Francisco Health Network ONLY provides first doses of COVID19 vaccine through Myturn and ONLY provides Pfizer vaccine for those scheduling through Myturn.""

[https://massvax.azurewebsites.us/](https://massvax.azurewebsites.us/)

&amp;#x200B;

I called and they do have Novavax, however it is only available for walk-in and not online-scheduled appointments and there can be a 1 to 1.5 hour wait.

&amp;#x200B;

# Datasources

I used this map: [https://www.solvhealth.com/ca/c/san-francisco-ca-srv-covid-vaccine?filter=novavax](https://www.solvhealth.com/ca/c/san-francisco-ca-srv-covid-vaccine?filter=novavax) and then called on September 23 to confirm availability. The California Department of Public Health's MyTurn website also has a list of vaccination sites, but in SF many of these incorrectly neglect to list that Novavax is available. [https://myturn.ca.gov/clinic.html](https://myturn.ca.gov/clinic.html)

&amp;#x200B;

There is also this crowdsourced website which I later found out about: [https://novavax-finder.github.io/#/ca/all?inStockOnly=true](https://novavax-finder.github.io/#/ca/all?inStockOnly=true)

&amp;#x200B;

# Novavax Vaccination Experiences at UCSF Laurel Heights

I scheduled an appointment through MyChart, they require you to fill out a few forms and waivers online. If you make an appointment, you need to print out a barcode and waiver confirmed OK form before you go. Enter at the California St and Walnut St. entrance. There are signs posted telling you to turn left for vaccination, turn right at the fork for Covid testing (so the vaccination site is separate from the potentially Covid-positive folks, hurray). Masks are required.

You need to ask for Novavax specifically (the nurse I talked with only asked if I wanted Pfizer or Moderna, it seems like even she didn't know about Novavax). It's a drive-through experience, you don't even need to get out of your car. The shot was quite smooth, they ask you which arm you want it in, roll down the window, get the shot and then drive away. CDC no longer requires you to wait at the vaccination site afterwards. But I parked outside on one of the side streets off Walnut Street and waited 30 minutes just in case I had any allergic symptoms.

&amp;#x200B;

# Post-Vaccination Experiences

Basically had some low to mild pain where they injected the shot for about 5 to 15 minutes afterwards, no big deal. And then I was perfectly fine for an hour. I took a nap, woke up with a minor headache which went away after around 2 hours. Felt perfectly fine the next day. Recommend getting the shot if you are still undecided or on the line.

You might want to avoid strenuous exercise for about 3-4 weeks afterward to reduce the risk of Myocarditis and Pericarditis (this risk seems to exist for Novavax as well): [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html)

Meta: What‚Äôs with all the guessing lately?,"I work in finance and have long followed this sub. I‚Äôve learned a lot. But I am disturbed and frustrated to see more and more of this sub is just people advocating predictions about the overall direction of the market without qualification. Presenting speculation as strategy. Literally people saying ‚Äúyou should buy UPRO now based on this moving average being greater than this one‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen the fed does X buy this and short this. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with.  Short term market guessing is basically an upper middle class hobby, and it should be allowed here, there should be no censorship. I want to be clear about that. 

But those who advocate a market timing strategy to newer users should always be upfront your predictions are just opinions, and any strategy other than buy, hold, and continually contribute has an objective poor track record. There are too many ‚Äúgurus‚Äù. I‚Äôm very concerned to see people on this sub saying they can predict what happens next because they correctly timed some past movement, and novice users who may be sucked into investment strategies because they trust these r/LETF ‚Äúgurus‚Äù. All research shows market timing doesn‚Äôt work. This sub seemed like it used to be more long term, high conviction bets on the upward motion of stocks and long term treasuries through the use of leverage. The main strategies have a solid rationale. HFEA is capturing more of the duration and equity risk premiums in a more diversified portfolio- fully in line with finance theory. Regarding straight UPRO- Bogle even often said that levered S&amp;P 500 is the best way to maximize long term returns (albeit with high volatility). The cases for 2X levered S and P 500 or HFEA beating SPY over long periods are solid. The case for market timing is laughably weak. 

We are in a bear market. All evidence shows that investors who calmly maintain an allocation, including a levered one, will do well, and those who jump in and out daily virtually always do poorly- though they always sweep failures under the rug. Speculate if you like. But you should always disclaim that predictions about the future of the stock market have an abysmal track record, and any newer user should absolutely follow buy and hold or continual contribution rather than some random redditor with an unscientific ‚Äúgreat track record‚Äù of timing TQQQ and TMF.

SHARE MARKET INVESTMENT TIPS,"It is important to go through some basic steps before you plunge into the world of trading and investing in the share market - otherwise you will end up confused, directionless and end up having a bitter experience in a market that is otherwise generous towards those who know how to play the game. Once you know the basic concepts, jargon and ideas on [how to trade in stock market](https://www.angelone.in/knowledge-center/share-market/how-to-trade-in-indian-share-market), you can start applying the following tips before making the first actual investment:

1. **Do adequate research** \- Before investing, you must understand what are the essential concepts of finance, economics and mathematics that you need to learn in order to make informed decisions. You must know the relevant jargon and the list of financial instruments in order to decode the terms that will appear in the trading platform or news and apply them to adjust to new conditions. Understand important concepts like stop-loss and limit orders as they can save you a lot of money in dire times.
2. **Decide your investment time frame** \- You can choose to perform intraday trading, swing trading, position trading or buy-and-hold investing. Each style represents a different range of time period for trading - intraday comprising multiple trades in the same day and buy-and-hold comprising buying a share to sell it in no less than a year. The choice depends on how much time you can give to tracking the investments, your risk appetite, knowledge base (e.g. intraday trading requires more knowledge of price action rather than fundamental analysis)
3. **Decide your risk appetite and corpus of funds** \- You may have ‚Çπ20,00,000 in your bank account but you may be comfortable investing only ‚Çπ50,000 in the beginning. You must also realise that your corpus of funds acts as a major constraint on what shares you can invest in.
4. **Choose an assortment of sectors** \- It is simply not possible for any trader/investor to understand the important factors controlling the entire economy or all companies and it is even harder to track the stock prices of a 100 companies. Therefore choose a maximum number of sectors that you plan on dealing with in the medium to long term and then choose one or more companies from each sector. Choose the sector if you understand both the market structure, the companies and the major trends of that sector.
5. **Choose the instruments of analysis** \- There are numerous price timelines, financial ratios and other metrics to use in judging the future of any company. You cannot look at them all, especially in trading styles of lower time frame such as intraday trading. Therefore, you must have an assortment of a few factors that you are going to look at before committing to a particular trade. It can be price movements, exponential moving averages, relative strength index, quick ratio, growth in cash flows etc. However, for long-term investing, you can devote greater time and therefore go over a higher number of variables before making a trade.
6. **Choose your broker** \- Finally, once you have decided on your methods for [online trading](https://www.angelone.in/), it is time for you to choose the broker or the online trading platform that you wish to work with - with whom you are going to open your Demat account. Base your decision on the brokerage charges, quality of the online trading platform, breadth of services, quality of information and guidance, maintenance charges and overall company fundamentals (legal safety, operational safety etc.). 

**Conclusion**

The number of shares borrowed daily from the lit pool doesn't account  for most of the daily short volume in the above period, as is clear from the data at [iborrowdesk.com/report/NVAX](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/NVAX) .

Similar observations can be made for many stocks in the market, right now and it shows heavy shorting of shares for those stocks maintained in the dark pools by MMs. This gives the false impression that long term shareholders are dumping their shares, when they are actually not and paints a more gloomy picture of the market than the real situation. Now let's look at where MMs are getting these shares from into their dark pools, as discussed in the following paragraphs.

As described in the following Reddit post, brokers typically lend out shareholder shares to MMs held in a margin account, even if shareholders are not using it: 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mojbj4/confirmed\_tdameritrade\_is\_lending\_shares\_out\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mojbj4/confirmed_tdameritrade_is_lending_shares_out_on/)

Fidelity states in the below Reddit post ""If you do not have a debit  balance in a margin account we will not lend your shares. If your shares  are held in a cash account we will not lend your shares."" 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/mn3dy2/hot\_topic\_how\_fidelity\_lends\_shares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/mn3dy2/hot_topic_how_fidelity_lends_shares/)

 [SEC bulletin on margin accounts](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_marginaccount) states the following: 

 

&gt;**Securities Lending**  
&gt;  
&gt;Some margin accounts allow the brokerage firm to lend out securities  in the account to a third-party, at any time without notice or  compensation to the account holder, if the investor has any outstanding  margin loan in the account. While shares are lent out, **you may lose the voting rights**  associated with those shares. You will still receive a payment for any  dividends related to lent out shares. ¬†However, since you are not the  official holder of the shares, **the payment you receive may be taxed differently**.  Ask your brokerage firm if its margin accounts allow for securities  lending, and if so, to explain how it works and may impact the  securities in the account.

Also, there are programs like [E\*Trade Fully Paid Lending (FPL) Program](https://us.etrade.com/what-we-offer/our-accounts/fully-paid-lending) that allow brokers to lend fully paid for shareholder shares for shorting. 

So, shareholder shares held in margin accounts or those that have been lent as part of programs like E\*Trade FPL are being used by MMs for dark pool shorting to drag the entire market down. All it takes to prevent this manipulation is a call to your broker to ask to convert any margin accounts that you have to cash accounts and to discontinue enrollment in programs like E\*Trade FPL.

I love coke meaning,"Disclaimer: I know this has to do with another stock and therefore ‚Äúnot relevant‚Äù, regardless I feel like because this has everything to do with the FALSE narrative that RC pump and dumped when we have the cokes, and freemans getting away with it‚Ä¶ i had to make a post: 

I love coke meaning:

So. Now with a little touch of hindsight we can look at this with the proper lens. 

What does this all mean?

The FCM Bee pump and dump, followed by the MNMD pump and dump, was possibly a group effort by the MSM, the Brokers and the SEC to pump up this stock and make a boatload of money.

This is market manipulation and my guess is‚Ä¶ Jake Freeman was used as a mule to cover the truth. This is most likely insider trading. The institutions know that the new cycles start(ed) and did this to profit off Bee They invested $25m and made over $100m front running their own algo.

They then painted a story that he dumped it to cause price anchoring and deter new investors from buying Bee

The whole thing reeks of fraud and crime, insider trading and market manipulation with influence from the MSM, Brokers and the SEC.

My theory: Freeman (the older ones) own a TON of Bee bonds and are set to lose millions if Bee doesn't die. The Bee pump (and use of their nephew, enjoy prison fucker) was just their hedge and there's a reason why Jakey boy hasn't even touched that 110m... it's cause it isn't his. It's his uncles and daddies / cokes money :)

This purchase also pushed Ryan Cohen over the 10% ownership so I think it was a tactic combined with the rising share cost pressuring him to sell. 14 days after the FCM 5m shares became public knowledge RC tweets out I love coke. In hindsight I think we know why 

What‚Äôs Jake doing now? 

Getting bag holders Ofc. 

Now with jakes attention for being a ‚Äúmeme trader‚Äù aka insider trader, he‚Äôs using his low amount of clout he has to continue to pump MNMD to redditors on another sub that I won‚Äôt name to avoid brigading. These poor bastards keep going ‚Äúwell he made 100m in Bee he must know what he‚Äôs doing‚Äù or ‚Äúuse that money jake!‚Äù When he probably can‚Äôt lol. Just like his days on the Bee sub he‚Äôs acting like he‚Äôs talking with the board for the interest of retail when really him and his family are just looking for a good exit. I honestly think he should be perm banned. He hyped up all week an announcement and all he did was release ‚Äústellar memes‚Äù (his words) trying to get Reddit to make MNMD a meme stock, which btw his uncle co founded.

Tl;dr RC tweeted I love coke the moment he found out about the freemans and cokes pushing him over 10% ownership knowing full well that a pump was about to come.",GME,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/xo03rc/i_love_coke_meaning/,üî¨ DD üìä,FCMhatescokes,xo03rc,/r/GME/comments/xo03rc/i_love_coke_meaning/,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/xo03rc,0,2022-09-25

**Foreign Policy:**

\-""MR. LANDON GOES TO MOSCOW;"" carried alongside a photograph of President Landon with Soviet troika members Mikhail Kalinin &amp; Lazar Kaganovich, the banner headline carried across the national Hearst press would announce to the nation the consecration of Alf Landon's premier foreign policy strategy: the opening of Bolshevik Russia. Relations between the Soviet government &amp; the oldest republic in the New World had been strained since the August Revolution of 1916, with White General Anatoly Pepelyayev later receiving aid against the Soviets from the United States in the disastrous Siberian Campaign of the American-Pacific War. Yet, shared economic woes &amp; rivalries with Japan would lead the 1928 Landon campaign to place the issue of diplomatic relations with Russia front &amp; center.

\-In Moscow, the question was equally tense. While lacking the persona of a leader since the deposition of Joseph Stalin by order of Lenin himself in 1924, the center faction of the Russian Communist Party would see an opportunity to maneuver the Right Opposition of Nikolai Bukharin &amp; Left Opposition of Leon Trotsky out of power, aided by the lack of direct participation from either Bukharin or Trotsky in the ruling Troika, in contrast to influential member of the Center Mikhail Kalinin. Despite his stance on the economic right, agrarianism &amp; worries of American intentions would lead Bukharin to declare Henry Ford &amp; other Americans calling for relations with the Soviet Union ""*wolves in sheeps' skin*,"" a stance used to divide the Right Opposition. With Trotsky &amp; the Left forging a surprise alliance with Bukharin, it would seem as if the Russian side of the coin was poised to drive Landon's foreign policy to the grave.

\-Neither Trotsky nor Bukharin expected the Center's final play however, dispatching Politburo member Lazar Kaganovich for a secret meeting with American Senator Dudley Field Malone, unbeknownst to the Soviet government. With Kaganovich reporting favorably to Kalinin, the Center would go above the heads of Trotsky &amp; Bukharin, bringing the matter of American relations before the Supreme Soviet rather than the Politburo. With the Politburo &amp; other institutions of Soviet leadership firmly under the control of allies of the Left or Right, Trotsky&amp; Bukharin would fail to consider the party itself, which had fallen under the control of Kalinin&amp; his center. Beginning with the appointment of Center member Vyacheslav Molotov as Special Envoy to the United States, the Party at large would vote with Kalinin, Molotov,&amp; their allies, first to rehabilitate Joseph Stalin. Sensing the shift of the political sands, Bukharin &amp; the Right would shift to a makeshift alliance against Trotsky, voting to remove Left Oppositionist Adolph Joffe, then in Europe for cancer treatment, from the Troika, to be replaced with none other than Molotov. 

\-Secretary of State Ernest Lundeen would formally meet with Molotov in Moscow over the summer of 1929, with Senator Dudley Field Malone, a close Landon ally, Henry Ford, &amp; Admiral William H. Standley co-leading the American delegation to negotiate what has gone down in history as the Molotov-Lundeen Pact. Firstly, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic would formally abolish its policy of, as Leon Trotsky phrased it, ""no war, no peace,"" wherein the Soviet government recognized a state of inactive conflict with all capitalist nations. Further, the United States &amp; RSFSR would grant one another both recognition, thus shifting American recognition from the White Russian government of Pyotr Wrangel. The Pact would recognize ""*spheres of mutual interest*"" in the Pacific &amp; grant partial access to the Russian economy to American businesses in return for aid in industrialization, in contrast to agreement on the American side to grant Russian goods most favored nation status in trade.

\-With the conclusion of the Pact in August, President Landon would fly to Moscow, meeting with Kalinin, Kaganovich, Molotov,&amp; others in the center, with Bukharin &amp; Trotsky both ordered away from the city amidst the American diplomatic visit. Denouncing Landon as the next in a long line of semi-communistic Farmer-Laborites, Thomas D. Schall would lead opposition in the Senate, facing pro-Treaty leader William Borah. Yet, with the support of most Liberal &amp; Unionist Senators, as well as Progressives Hiram Johnson, Charles McNary, &amp; Francis J. Heney &amp; Conservative Republicans such as Hannibal E. Hamlin, the Molotov-Lundeen Pact would pass the Senate in a narrow vote.

\-Alongside Hearst, no outlet would so fiercely oppose Molotov-Lundeen as the Radio Corporation of America, with nation's largest radio network, headed by former collaborationist General James G. Harbord &amp; reputedly heavily Japanese-funded, claiming the Pact to represent a betrayal of every Federal soldier who fought &amp; died to suppress the Revolution. In addition, Japanese Ambassador Yosuke Matsuoka would denounce the pact as the greatest setback in American-Japanese relations since the American-Pacific War. 

\-Landon would cite Molotov-Lundeen as a tremendous success. With the pact negotiated with the primary goal of a united front against Japanese &amp; British imperialism, Landon would receive word of the withdrawal of Japanese troops from California&amp; Washington in December of 1929. The Japanese government would cite the economic crash &amp; the need for strength to protect its interests in Siberia &amp; China, nonetheless, the Landon Administration would assign credit to Molotov-Lundeen. By November of 1930, Austrian troops would vacate North Carolina, alongside remaining Canadian forces in Michigan &amp; New England, &amp; Argentinian forces in Puerto Rico, leaving only several hundred Japanese troops in San Francisco &amp; the French occupation of Washington, D.C. as the remnants of a decade of humiliation.

\-Citing the permission granted by President Lejeune for an indefinite occupation of the capital, French dictator Philippe Petain would refuse requests by the Landon Administration to withdraw a single French soldier or sailor from the United States capital. Thus, 4,182 French troops remain in the capital, gaining infamy for a refusal to pay bills at restaurants &amp; indiscriminate killing of local wildlife. Most famously, a group of young French soldiers under Captain Edmond Jouhaud would kidnap the Landon family's Pekingese dog for a week, with the Petain government refusing to discipline or even recall the troops. 

\-The beginning of the tumbling of the global economy in October of 1929 would come within a week of the death of White Russian leader Pyotr Wrangel. With the surprise death of Wrangel, White Russian commanders Boris Savinkov, Anton Denikin, &amp; Alexander Kolchak would struggle for power. With the longtime Austrian protector of White Russia, Franz-Ferdinand, having died earlier in the year, 17 year old Austrian Emperor Otto would face his first major crisis. Alongside a worldwide depression, Otto would receive news of an excursion into Wrangel's rump Russian state by Soviet forces under General Kliment Voroshilov. However, as the Hapsburg Court debated the matter of intervention, Alf Landon would see the most favored nation status allotted to the Soviets in trade come into play for the first time.

\-In February of 1930, with Austrian supply support flowing to South Russia despite a steady Bolshevik advance, Landon would announce to the nation over the airwaves a new chapter in the history of Russo-American relations. Noting the unemployment plaguing the nation, Landon would ""*appeal to the owners of plants, to the managers, to the workers, to our own government employees to put every ounce of effort into producing  munitions swiftly &amp; without stint*,"" arguing that a revitalization of the munitions sector to supply a military buildup in the RSFSR presented to the nation a means of rekindling the industrial sector as a whole. While nonetheless criticizing the Soviet invasion, Landon would justify support on the grounds of the future, arguing that the peace of the world would soon depend upon the United States &amp; Russia. 

\-Despite Congressional opposition following the midterm elections of 1930, millions of dollars of American goods would flow north in aid of the Soviet conquest of White Russia, completed in 1930, &amp; the following swift invasion of Kazakhstan in 1930. However, May of 1931 would see an escalation of the crisis as Japanese planes would sink the American tanker *Veedol II,* with Japanese Prime Minister Koki Hirota announcing the willingness of the Japanese government to sink any &amp; all American ships traveling through the Arctic Ocean to supply the RSFSR. In response, Landon would authorize a state funeral for every sailor on the *Veedol II,* however, shipments to the RSFSR would be heavily curbed with fears of Japanese reprisal. 

\-With his radio show syndicated nationally via RCA, Father Charles Coughlin, the most listened to broadcaster in the nation, would blame the Landon Administration for the deaths, defending the Japanese attack &amp; arguing for the merits of a vociferous anti-communist stance abroad &amp; defending the Petain Regime in France, crediting them with a ""*domestic crusade*"" against the supposed Red Menace.

\-With the Japanese economy in turmoil &amp; a vast need for natural resources in the face of Feng Yuxiang's successes in China, controversy would erupt in the United States as General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the so-called ""Tiger of Boise"" from his role commanding Japanese troops suppressing American revolutionary forces, would lead Japanese forces to sweep over the Philippines in 1931. James G. Harbord, Hugh S. Johnson, John F. O'Ryan,&amp; other collaborationist Generals would speak in favor of Japan, with the Radio Corporation of America going so far as to broadcast Japanese propaganda in English arguing that Japanese involvement in the Philippines is a necessary evil in the prevention of communism. Meanwhile, Landon would take to the airwaves in opposition, denouncing Japanese actions as setting the stage for a ""blood bath,"" becoming the first world leader to publicize allegations of Japanese war crimes in the takeover.

[A farmer flees the Dust Bowl.](https://preview.redd.it/kwfbedpz51q91.png?width=395&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e80ccd07a4bfed51c57129df981682666bf5b0f)

**Domestic Policy:**

\-October 4th, 1929. The Tokyo Stock Exchange would buzz with dread, news of a surprise advance through Manchuria by the pro-independence Chinese forces of Feng Yuxiang's National People's Army, the first major advance since 1920, capturing both military factories &amp; those of the Mitsui Zaibatsu. Since the fall of Xian in 1916, the Japanese economy had grown to be without equal, with the mining of the resources of China combined with the largest industrial expansion in world history by the corporate oligarchy of Japanese business through a conquered land. The bubble had come to hold vast British, Argentinian, French,&amp; Austrian investments, yet, beginning with the news of Chinese forces at the gates of Harbin, the market would crash. 

\-The reverberations of the collapse of the Tokyo Stock Exchange would echo through the world, sending the British, Argentine,&amp; Austrian economies down in flames. Though the first months of the Landon presidency had seen unemployment fall to 7.2%, with inflation collapsing from 29.4% to 17.5%, the economic tsunami from Japan would plunge the gradually recovering United States economy into a farrago. Unemployment would soon pass 20%, with inflation soaring to nearly 40%. The issue would be compounded amidst the collapse of a housing bubble in Florida &amp; record soil erosion in the Great Plains, setting the stage for the Dust Bowl crisis, as clouds of top soil rendered millions of farmers without a crop, which has fueled new growths in urbanization. From his Florida retirement mansion, William Jennings Bryan would call upon Landon to utilize the Butler Act to inject funds into the economy to guarantee farms &amp; small businesses, while Speaker Henry Ashurst would call for a bailout of banks &amp; large businesses, introducing a speech by financier Bernard Baruch into the Congressional Record. 

\-However, citing skyrocketing inflation rates, Landon would refuse to act on either, earning the ire of former ally Marion Butler. Rather, Landon would call upon the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by whatever level necessary to stop inflation, with rates reaching a peak of 35.4%, effectively stonewalling the American economy. Leading opposition to Landon on the issue would be Unionist Senator William Aberhart of Vancouver &amp; longtime political insider Robert Latham Owen, who would carry forth the banner of the social credit movement to argue for lower interest rates as a means of increasing the amount of capital in individual hands. Inflation rates would peak at 43.8% in January of 1930, yet would begin to slowly but steadily fall for the remainder of the Landon presidency, standing at 8.9% by April of 1932, excepting the period immediately after the passage of the Coughlin Act, wherein falling silver prices would drive inflation above 20% for several months. 

\-The same cannot be said for unemployment, which would grow to 34.6% by 1930. With the collapse of such large corporations as Armour Foods, coupled with nearly five billion dollars worth of aid to local business through the Bryan years, small business has become the backbone of the American economy as regards unemployment. Many have credited the increased reliance on small business with preventing a complete collapse with the fall of stock market, while others have criticized such policies as contrary to innovation. Further, the Landon Administration would cut back on public works programs until 1931. 

\-Meanwhile, with the panic fueling a bank run, the largest banks in the nation would fall as if they were dominoes, with an estimated 9,000 total banks failing amidst the Landon presidency. In New York, Frank A. Vanderlip's City Bank, famous as the nation's premier launderer of Japanese money, would open a new branch within the remaining Japanese occupied sector of San Fransisco. It would not be enough; with the economic crash of their Japanese allies, Vanderlip's bank would crash, despite the man himself preserving much of his fortune. 

\-Despite his longtime advocacy for wealth caps &amp; high tax rates, Milford W. Howard would invite Thomas Lamont of J.P. Morgan to Birmingham for a secret conference in February of 1930. Days later, the board of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. would depose J.P. Morgan Jr. himself as Chairman of the Board in favor of Lamont, who would announce a partnership with the state of Alabama. With the bank on the verge of collapse, it would relocate itself to Alabama, accepting financial aid to keep itself from failing entirely. Union Carbide Chemical &amp; Central Leather would soon join the so-called ""Exodus to Alabama,"" partnering with Howard's fascist state in a move that would lead to a renewal of calls for federal action against the quasi-independent status of Alabama. Led by former General Smedley Butler in his first re-appearance on the political stage since his public humiliation by Ruth McCormick, a petition to federally intervene in Alabama would garner the support of dozens of members of Congress, only to find itself ignored by President Landon. 

\-The fall of much of the banking system has fueled the burgeoning credit union movement. Credit union advocates Roy Bergengren, Dora Maxwell,&amp; Pierre Jay have begun combining portions of their personal wealth with community organization to establish local credit unions across the nation. However, Bergengren has fiercely opposed government aid to credit unions, arguing that such a policy would sacrifice the fundamental independence of the concept of a credit union. Allying with Bergengren, the People's Ownership Smash Crime Rings Party has come to advocate for credit unions as an alternative to banks, while opposing any suggestion of federal aid. 

\-With Congress in the throes of deadlock prior to the midterm elections of 1930, President Landon would find his actions, or lack thereof, the primary drivers of federal economic policy. Nonetheless, the summer of 1930 would see the passage of dual pieces of major legislation. Firstly, the Coughlin Act, authored by infamous radio priest Father Charles Coughlin, also among the nation's chief investors in the silver industry, in his capacity as Unionist Representative from Michigan, Coughlin's bill would abolish the mandate of market parity on silver to gold in American bimetallism in favor of the free coinage of silver at a ratio of 16-1, effectively re-instituting the silver standard inaugurated by Lyman Trumbull &amp; driven from force in the first term of Aaron Burr Houston. With the support of the vast majority of the Commonwealth caucus, along with near universal Union &amp; Farmer-Labor support, the Coughlin Act would make its way through Congress swiftly.

\-Unperturbed, President Landon would vow to veto the bill, underestimating partisan pressures. On July 17th of 1930, Landon would find a letter on his White House desk from Secretary of State Ernest Lundeen, bearing below it the co-signatures of lower Cabinet officials Nellie Tayloe Ross, Charles A. Jonas, Edward H. Moore,&amp; Mary Elizabeth Lease, promising to resign in the event of a veto. Less than an hour later, Marion Butler would arrive with a letter from William Jennings Bryan, informing Landon that a veto would win the universal condemnation of his party &amp; suggesting that either Butler or Bryan would be willing to mount a primary challenge to the President in 1932.

\-Trapped between the foundations of belief &amp; the winds of politics, Landon would quietly turn away from the bill. While refusing to attach his signature to it, Landon would allow the Coughlin Act to become law. 

\-Recognizing a lack of congressional support for the privatization of railroads, with both Speakers Ashurst &amp; Dill stringent supporters of nationalization, Landon would appoint former Montana Representative Thomas J. Walsh, a Liberal who had joined Franklin Delano Roosevelt's 1916 ""Beerhall"" faction, as administrator of the United States Railroad Administration.

\-With the midterm elections of 1930, across the board Farmer-Labor victories &amp; a promise by Clarence Dill to prioritize his vision for reform over the wishes of Landon, Speaker Dill would move to act. Though 1929 had seen a raise in the land value tax to 30%, Dill would attend the national convention of the Single Tax League in 1931 to extend a prior promise to Commonwealth representatives to bring the tax over 50%. 

\-Nonetheless, the so-called ""Giant of Washington"" would begin with the Thomas Bill, named for New York Representative Norman Thomas, approving the nationalization of natural gas distribution &amp; telephone systems, both policies President Landon had previously stated support for. Narrowly passing both houses of Congress with the support of a handful of Union &amp; Commonwealth members, the Dill would herald the Thomas Bill as the beginning of a regimen of reform to combat the depression.

\-However, to the shock of Dill &amp; the Farmer-Labor caucus, Landon would veto the Thomas Bill. Declaring that past support of nationalization was merely ""a gun behind the door,"" Landon would argue that, considering the circumstances, nationalization was not ideal, instead calling upon Congress to merely set price controls on such services. In response, an enraged Speaker Dill would denounce the President as a ""changeling,"" vowing to deny him re-election in 1932 if he continued opposition to such measures. 

\-Thus, Dill would begin the construction of the largest omnibus bill in American history, the Recovery Act of 1931. Building upon the telephone &amp; natural gas distribution nationalizations in the initial Thomas Bill, Dill would incorporate a myriad of reform proposals from across the aisle in an attempt to convince Landon to sign the act, or build a veto proof majority in case of continued opposition. From Delaware's Frank Stephens would come a 57% federal land value tax rate; to compensate, California Representative Clarence Lea would introduce the Lea Amendment, reducing the top income tax rate from 88% to 59%, with the reluctant support of Clarence Dill in an attempt to court the support of the President; from Nebraska Senator George Norris, the bill would be amended to include a half a billion dollar allotment for seed loans to farmers, while amendments from Iowa's Lester Dickinson would marginally raise farm tariffs &amp; a last moment Senate amendment by Marion Butler would approve another half a billion for spending in small business aid.

\-In addition, with many taking advantage of the newly created Public Works Administration included within, the act would contain record levels of so-called ""pork,"" federal funding for local infrastructure &amp; similar projects to aid the districts of representatives whose votes would prove key to its passage, such as former Speaker Henry Ashurst. Nonetheless, Dill's strategy would find success, with the Reconstruction Finance Act passing the House with flying colors &amp; narrowly winning similar passage in the Senate, finally setting it on the course for the President's desk. While passing, the Senate debate over the bill would see a show of the characteristic vituperations of Thomas D. Schall, declaring that Dill had become a dictator of the House, ""taking the powers of the elected sentinels of the people under the cloak of a censorship you have demanded &amp; approved.""

\-With the implementation of tax cuts, President Landon would echo his prior position on the Coughlin Act, refusing to veto the bill, yet declining to formally endorse it, permitting Clarence Dill's magnum opus to pass without the President's signature.

\-Having paid between one &amp; ten billion dollars in reparations per annum to Canada, Argentina, or Japan, the nation's spiral into a complete Depression &amp; the ghastly influence of inflation would gradually devastate the American ability to properly pay reparations. Thus, in November of 1931, the Landon Administration would announce the next step upon the road to penury, cited by Landon as a justification for his own spending policies: the United States Treasury was near default.

\-With that, payments of social Security, business aid, seed loans,&amp; public works would grind to a week long halt, as Canadian forces reoccupied Detroit on orders from Prime Minister HUgh Guthrie. Borrowing against his own 40% interest rates, Landon has managed to begin government function anew via loans, taken domestically from the Federal Reserve. Further, Landon has credited the Molotov-Lundeen Pact &amp; the opening of major trade relations with the RSFSR as crucial to keeping the Treasury afloat. However, with the devastation of government credit, Landon has taken a move without precedent in calling for the repeal of the Trumbull Era prohibition on peacetime bonds.

\-With the collapse of the economy, the long arm of the law has receded across the nation. In the face of ailing public institutions, no single entity has done more to fill the void than organized crime. 

\-In Chicago, anti-revolutionary hero Al Capone would gradually build a political machine through the 1920s, allegedly fusing the criminal ""Chicago Outfit"" with a gradual takeover of the local Commonwealth Party. With the victory of John Dill Robertson in the mayoral elections of 1927 upon a platform dedicated to an end to corruption, Capone would find himself declared an enemy of the city, as law enforcement encircled the political boss, aiming for definite evidence of connections to the Chicago Outfit. Mayor Robertson, however, would soon learn of the dangers of trapping a snake in a corner.

\-And so, February 14th of 1929 would see ""Scarface"" strike back in the so-called the St. Valentine's Day bombings. Beginning with a grenade tossed into the mayor's Ford Model A, over 62 bombings &amp; countless murders across Chicago within 36 hours would eliminate Mayor Robertson, Police Chief Morgan Collins, rival gangster Bugs Moran, District Attorney Edwin Olson, &amp; dozens of civilians. With the Mayor's office open, the nation would watch in shock as Capone would maneuver his way into control of the city with a victory in a special mayoral election, completing the merger of government power with his own Chicago Outfit &amp; the Illinois Commonwealth Party. Appointing mob enforcer Frank Nitti as Police Chief, Capone would further win the support of a group of breakaway Unionists under former Governor William Hale Thompson, opposed to the decision of the regular Union Party to join a burgeoning anti-crime coalition. 

\-From Capone's Chicago Outfit to New York's Lucky Luciano, the mafia has threatened to poison the very well of authority from which governmental authority must sprout. Yet, seizing upon a refusal by President Landon to increase funding to J. Edgar Hoover Bureau of Investigation, the issue of crime has become the rallying cry for a movement that has taken the nation by storm: People's Ownership Smash Crime Rings. Seeking to unite the opposition to Farmer-Labor &amp; urged by Ruth Hanna McCormick to recognize the power of the crime issue, former President Aaron Burr Houston would accept a meeting with 1928 Union presidential nominee Huey Long, William Randolph Hearst, Milford W. Howard, George S. Schuyler, &amp; Thomas D. Schall to discuss the unification of the Union, Progressive, Conservative Republican, &amp; American Constitutional parties under a single banner. With Hearst demanding the inclusion of the words ""people's ownership"" into the name, the delegates would emerge with the LIttle Rock Compact. Bearing the signatures of party leaders &amp; confirmation of the cumbersome moniker, the Little Rock Compact has functioned as a veritable birth certificate for what has become nicknamed the Grand Opposition Party (GOP).

\-In Pennsylvania, Smedley Butler has gained fame for his role in defeating Philadelphia crime rings, with former President Lejeune dubbing him the greatest policeman in American history. Nonetheless, Butler has kept a low profile nationally since the public campaign against him by Ruth Hanna McCormick.

\-Among the most influential anti-corruption efforts has been that of Cuban broadcaster Eduardo Chib√°s, the most listened to radio figure in the Hispanophonic Caribbean states. The 25 year old Chib√°s would explode onto the national scene with an expose of the continued political importance of 90 year old former Governor Henry Clay Warmoth, known to have embezzled government funds throughout his public career, in Cuban politics. Chib√°s has gone on to reveal documents outing Governor Mario Garcia Menocal as involved in a kickback scheme, fueling his resignation,&amp; forcefully posited that the Cuban Crisis continues to haunt the island's government, while targeting the influence of organized crime in Puerto Rico &amp; Santo Domingo.

\-Macomb, Illinois, population 8,509. The small Illinois farmer village would bear witness to the largest outbreak of open rebellion since the Revolution, in the early days of 1931. National Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic Alvin Owsley would make headlines by issuing a declaration of complete opposition to President Landon on January 7th of 1931, noting his opposition to expansion of veterans' pensions, while vowing to redouble efforts in favor of William Randolph Hearst. Nonetheless, Owsley would stop short of arguing for violence.

\-In Owsley's stead, Illinois farmer F.G. Vining would gather 400 friends, neighbors,&amp; kinsmen from around McDonough County to protest the Bryan era nationalization of grain silos &amp; government management of farm price bidding, a policy popular among many farmers to the West, but despised in the plains of Illinois, coalescing into the Corn Belt Liberty League. Further, attempts to institute crop management by the Illinois state government would drive the County into a frenzy, with up to 127 local farmers refusing to comply. Finally, on March 1st, the tinder set by Vining's fiery rhetoric &amp; the discontent of a people in pain would spark. Vining's farmers would tar &amp; feather government agents &amp; expel local police from Macomb &amp; the surrounding farm areas. Farmer Finley Foster would be proclaimed Mayor of Macomb, ousting the elected Farmer-Labor city government. 

\-The Corn Belt Liberty League would face McDonough County Sheriff Guy Hardisty, famed for hunting down local poor children who had stolen food &amp; holding prisoners in local jail for months without trial. Hardisty would soon find himself in the confines of his own jail cell, denied rations as farmers' children butchered &amp; ate his prize pig. Popular among local farmers, newly anointed Senator Ruth Hanna McCormick would travel to McDonough County in a last ditch attempt to prevent mass violence, with letters in hand from popular conservative farm politician Lester Dickinson &amp; Governor James Oglesby. With McCormick strong-arming Oglesby into agreeing to end limitations on crop production, she would convince the Liberty League to free Sheriff Hardisty &amp; relinquish control of the city, while enraging observers nationally with a refusal to pursue prosecution of those involved, reluctantly accepted by the Governor.

\-In similar news, St. Paul, Minnesota police chief Tom Brown has been fired by newly elected Mayor &amp; former Hennepin County sheriff John P. Wall for ordering the firing upon a crowd of rioting farmers in 1927, killing eleven. Further, Brown would be accused of corruption &amp; ties to crime ring leaders Ma Barker &amp; John Dillinger.

\-Despite trepidation from many among the rank &amp; file of the union, the appointment of famously dictatorial General Trades Union President John L. Lewis as Secretary of the Treasury &amp; Lewis ally Philip Murray to the Labor Department has won Landon the concrete support of GTU leadership. In another victory for the now centenarian union, 1930 would see the final demise of the conservative Knights of Labor founded by the late Terence V. Powderly.

\-With the Farmer-Labor victories of 1930, the Senate would vote to approve a committee to investigate the conduct of American forces in Moroland during the colonial era, over protests from within the military led by Rafael Trujillo, who had accused any such committee of merely acting as a vehicle of calumny towards himself &amp; other veterans of the Moro Conflict, such as General Jacob H. Smith, awarded the Medal of Honor by John R. Lynch for ""pacification"" of the island colony. The Committee has yet to begin hearings.

\-Upon his death, longtime Forest Service Head Henry C. Wallace would find himself replaced by William Colby, leader of the conservationist Sierra Club, who has maintained federal protections on forest areas despite pressure from more conservative aspects of the Administration to free tracts of forest for commercial usage to alleviate the Depression.

\-With his political career behind him, former Secretary of State Won Alexander Cumyow has worked within his position as the ""grand old man of Chinatown"" to further promote the ""stab in the back"" theory, with Cumyow's call to ""make America great again,"" referencing past hawkish policies as regards Japan, a near ubiquitous slogan in Chinese-American communities across the nation. Meanwhile, with Ford Motor weathering the depression despite the market failure of the newly released Model A, Henry Ford would issue his sole public political remark since his political demise at the hands of Ruth Hanna McCormick to declare Cumyow a national hero for formulating the theory. Further, Ford has become a leading sponsor of aviator Charles Lindbergh, the United States' leading international celebrity. 

\-German-born Representative Robert Wagner's Wagner Amendment, codifying the removal of suffrage to revolutionaries into the constitution, while amending the natural born citizen clause has failed to expand its base of support, with several state legislators, such as that of Wyoming, rescinding support in the aftermath of Farmer-Labor victories in local elections.

\-Pappy O'Daniel's constitutional amendment reforming the presidency to a single, six-year term while exempting former Presidents, has won the support of a 29 state legislatures, gradually approaching the necessary 3/4, or 37 states, despite the vociferous opposition of President Landon himself.

\-Former President William Jennings Bryan has dedicated much of his post-presidency to campaigning for a constitutional amendment ""*recognizing the law &amp; authority of Jesus Christ over the United States,*"" which would win ratification from 28 state legislatures by 1931. However, the death of Bryan in his sleep at age 71 would jolt the nation in January of 1932, driving the number of ratifying states to 33, within a month, owing to many seeing the Christ Amendment as the final legacy of the legendary Great Commoner.

\-Philadelphia garment worker James Hay has been noticed as having grown increasingly distraught by neighbors. Having taken a keen interest in politics since his arrival in Pennsylvania in 1922, initially considered a few cards short of a deck for his odd haircut &amp; difficulty remembering his name, Hay has closely followed events in the Soviet Union &amp; taken to writing heavily, amusing several neighbors in his broken down apartment with the suggestion that he, of all people, might try his hand at journalism. 

\-Inventions in President Landon's term include the electric guitar, strobe light, &amp; golf cart.

**Supreme Court Appointments:**

&amp;#x200B;

\-Having served on the court for a total of 29 years. 14 of which as Chief Justice, the death of William Howard Taft would open the position of Chief Justice to be filled by President Landon, his sole opportunity to appoint a Justice to the court. After much consideration, Landon would turn to appease party radicals with the appointment of Jacob Panken, Russian born Justice of the New York Court of Appeals. A leader amongst Farmer-Labor radicals &amp; local organizer for Richard F. Pettigrew, Panken would gain fame for his refusal to work with Benjamin Gitlow's Bronx Soviet. With the full might of the Radio Corporation of America &amp; Hearst Press turned on the New York Judge, dark clouds would begin to gather around Panken's hopes.

\-Thomas Schall would dub Panken ""*acclaimed in the Communist Russian newspapers*,"" noting his prior involvement with the Workers' Party of America despite his role in the fight against the Bronx Soviet. In response, William Borah, Farmer-Laborite of Shoshone, would provide an issue of *Pravda,* in which Panken was attacked as a counter-revolutionary. Nonetheless, Liberal leader David I. Walsh of Massachusetts would join the chorus labeling Panken a communist, with Hiram Johnson, a prior supporter of Panken, completing a political turnabout by accusing him of desiring to ""*Russianize the Court &amp; inflict on our people the curse of Communism*."" New York Senator Royal S. Copeland, a former local political opponent of Panken, would claim that he had ""*let communism run rampant in public schools*."" With a frenzied Senate battle in the works, Landon would shock Panken &amp; the nation by withdrawing the nomination of Panken in favor of Dudley Field Malone. 

\-A conservative Farmer-Laborite &amp; close ally of the President, the 48 year old former attorney would quickly win confirmation as Chief Justice of the United States in a near unanimous vote.

Surviving the Recession as a Digital Marketing Agency,"As we come close to the end of the third quarter of 2022, in the current economy all economic research is doom and gloom, it is more important than ever for digital marketing agencies to focus on growth. Companies are cutting back on non-essential spending, which can often (and counterintuitively) include digital marketing budgets. An environment where online marketing budgets are being cut makes it more difficult for digital marketing agencies to keep, let alone grow their businesses. However, there are still things that you can do to keep your business moving forward. In this blog post, we will discuss some tips for surviving and thriving in a recession as a digital marketing agency.

## What is a recession?

A recession is an economic cycle where the economy is contracting typically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. This can be caused by many factors, such as a decrease in consumer spending, a decrease in business investment, or a rise in unemployment. When the economy is in a recession and economic growth is negative, it can be difficult for businesses to grow. Eventually, things will calm down and the global economy will experience economic recovery again but nobody (including the Federal Reserve Bank and the International Monetary Fund) knows exactly when that will happen. This is a business cycle where the money supply and monetary policy be tight and every business needs to be aware of that.

## What happens during a recession?

Economic research shows, that in an economic recession economic outputs, employment and consumer expenditures fall. The government's fiscal deficit expands because tax revenue dwindles, while expenditure on unemployment insurance increases as new individuals qualify. Consequently, the government's debt-to-GDP ratio increases.

None of the above is good news.

In the digital marketing agency business, it means that you have to get scrappy and creative as your clients will look for ways to reduce digital marketing spending. Here's what they might do:

* Review their current digital marketing spending and every marketing channel and identify areas where they can cut back without sacrificing results. **So focus on revenue-related services!**
* Make use of free or low-cost digital marketing tools rather than the usual global brands. **Make sure you've got good deals with the tools you use.**
* Try to negotiate better rates with suppliers and partners. This includes you! **Get ready to discuss your pricing**
* Rapidly cut back on non-revenue generating items like PR and new development. **Be prepared to diversify your offering.**

## Are we in a global recession?

in short: Yes (or almost)

The world is now entering a recession as a result of the covid pandemic. This recession is expected to be worse than the last recession in 2008. Whilst is no definitive answer,  most economists say that the recession began sometime in late 2019 or early 2020.

Here are the signs to be aware of :

* A general slump in economic activity and industrial production
* A decrease in consumer demand
* A significant decline in business investment
* High unemployment rate
* Sharp stock market declines
* An increase in borrowing costs
* A rise in inflation and interest rates
* Stagnant or dropping gross domestic product (negative economic growth)

## What should you do in a recession?

The main thing to do in a recession as a business is to focus on growth. Every business should take have an action plan to prepare for an economic downturn. Here are three main things you can do:

### 1. Be proactive

In a recession, it is more important than ever to be proactive. This means that you need to be on the lookout for opportunities and be prepared to capitalize on them when they arise. You also need to be prepared for things to change quickly, so you can adapt as needed. The worst thing you can do is stand still.

### 2. Focus on efficiency

In a recession, businesses often have to do more with less. This means that you need to focus on efficiency and make sure that you are getting the most out of your resources. You should also look for ways to streamline your processes and reduce wastage.

### 3. Stay positive

A recession can be a difficult time for businesses, but it is important to stay positive and focused on your goals. Remember that things will eventually improve, the global recession will end and economic recovery will come. So, until the economic expansion comes back, keep working hard to grow your business!

Tweaking approach to getting to FIRE given current outlook,"*TLDR: High inflation, low / negative stock market returns means I am adding a bunch of debt instead of investing.  My SWAG: Inflation will be higher than stock market returns until I retire
*

Current status:

- 450k Pension (goal 750k)
- 150k ISA / GIA (goal 250k)
- 50k PB, Cash
- Mortgage free on 900k house
- Married, Single Income 160-200k PA
- Six years to fire (was the plan)

Significant outgoings that I'm not changing

- 1.2k a month on kids University
- 0.5k per month on Eating out
- 0.5k per month on sport, theatre

Current approach:

- Max Pension every year
- Max ISA
- Spare income into GIA

New approach:

- Continue max Pension / ISA (VWRL)
- Stop GIA contributions
- Move PBs / Cash into savings accounts
- Pay for everything on 24mo 0% credit cards - I mean everything
- Large expenditure on 0% finance (kitchen, sofa, etc)
- Put all spare income into savings accounts to pay cards 

What's my SWAG

- Inflation will peak between 8-10% next two years
- Inflation will remain at 6-8% for the foreseeable future
- Best case on VWRL is ~4% YOY growth, more likely 0-2% for next 10 years",FIREUK,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREUK/comments/xnjvvk/tweaking_approach_to_getting_to_fire_given/,,jeremyascot,xnjvvk,/r/FIREUK/comments/xnjvvk/tweaking_approach_to_getting_to_fire_given/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREUK/comments/xnjvvk/tweaking_approach_to_getting_to_fire_given/,0,2022-09-25

Stock Market = GoFundMe for Billionaires,"This post is for intelligent people to contemplate. The idiots here will do the usual attacks on the OP or make remarks that are irrelevant or off point. And it is expected because they are terrified of the thought that ""dumb money"" wises up to the scheme and never buys stocks again!

1. **None of you will ever make money going long**. Chances are 99.99% that that stock that doubled or tripled or quadrupled or more was a stock you either never owned or sold too early. Wall Street uses multi-million-dollar tools and software to know when retailers are out of positions. It's then when they soar the stock price. 
2. **The more you hold, the lower it goes**. Just look at your portfolio...100% of your holding are down. How do you account for the insiders making record salaries when you are losing?
3. **The more you buy, the more you pay for billionaire's lifestyle costs.** These companies will take your money and simply lower the price to keep you at a loss. They will go to zero, reverse split, do secondaries, and you will never make a profit. All your losses pay for the lambos and coke on Wall Street.
4. **The Fed's job is to protect the wealthy 1%**. Jerome is attacking housing specifically. He is attacking the common share specifically. He is attacking the consumer specifically. What do all three have in common? They are the core of the middle class. These are the people who are trying to be successful. But the wealthy 1% don't like it. So they order the Fed to raise rates. And you thought Jerome was in charge? Think again.
5. **Big Banks pay savers 0.05%, but want 6%+ from borrowers**. That should make no fucking sense to anyone reading this. That is clear cabal, and that is illegal in this country. That's not ""free market"" capitalism.

Private lending is on the rise. Many people will withdraw their millions from banks and loan it out peer-to-peer. Who wouldn't want to earn 5%+ on seller financing when selling a house? Who wouldn't want to earn 8%+ on seller financing of commercial property?

Peer-to-peer lending is coming...and it will be big. The banks are going to lose.",StockMarket,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/xntfkd/stock_market_gofundme_for_billionaires/,Opinion,Obvious-Expert-007,xntfkd,/r/StockMarket/comments/xntfkd/stock_market_gofundme_for_billionaires/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/xntfkd/stock_market_gofundme_for_billionaires/,0,2022-09-25
What is Marketcap ??,"Market capitalization (or market cap) is the total dollar value of all the shares of a company‚Äôs stock ‚Äî or, in the case of Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, of all the coins that have been mined. In crypto, market cap is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins that have been mined by the price of a single coin at any given time.

Why is market cap important?

Price is just one way to measure a cryptocurrency‚Äôs value. Investors use market cap to tell a more complete story and compare value across cryptocurrencies. As a key statistic, it can indicate the growth potential of a cryptocurrency and whether it is safe to buy, compared to others.

What can you do with market cap?

Market cap allows you to compare the total value of one cryptocurrency with another so you can make more informed investment decisions.

Cryptocurrencies are classified by their market cap into three categories:

Large-cap :  cryptocurrencies  including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have a market cap of more than $10 billion. 

Mid-cap : cryptocurrencies have market caps between $1 billion and $10 billion ‚Äì they generally are considered to have more untapped potential upside but also higher risk. 

Small-cap : cryptocurrencies have a market cap of less than $1 billion and are most susceptible to dramatic swings based on market sentiment.",u_Ok-Art1101,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok-Art1101/comments/xnpyr9/what_is_marketcap/,,Ok-Art1101,xnpyr9,/r/u_Ok-Art1101/comments/xnpyr9/what_is_marketcap/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok-Art1101/comments/xnpyr9/what_is_marketcap/,0,2022-09-25
34m General Advice / ?Fee only financial advisor,"Hi all. First of all I know how lucky I am to have the problem that I have. I am a high earner looking to slow down with work at 40 and retire at 50. Here is my rough financial breakdown 

Assets - 

Portfolio - 550k mostly in low fee index funds

401 K - 70k fidelity total stock market

Roth IRA - 20K 

Cash - 100K, plan to get this back into the market quickly

Property - Worth about 550k, mortgages as below, currently bringing in about $3,750/month in rent 

Bonds - 20k ibonds

&amp;#x200B;

Income - 

Rental income - $45K/year

Job income - $600k/year (w2)

&amp;#x200B;

Liabilities - 

Mortgage 1 - 260k @ 2.25%, about 28 years left

Mortgage 2 - 35k @ 3.5%, about 4 years left 

&amp;#x200B;

Costs - 

Mortgages, taxes, insurance, incidentals, management fees on rentals - $31,000 / year

Personal living expenses including rent - $60k / year 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of retirement, I think my spending would increase a bit as my free time increases but overall I have simple taste and no children. I imagine that if I slow down work at 40 my spending would increase to about 80k, then 100k at full retirement. I think I could make about $250k/year working half time so slowing down work wouldn't be full coastFIRE (would still be able to invest). I know I am pretty well set up. Plan is to just keep investing into reasonable index funds both pre and post tax. Definitely do not want any more properties (the two properties are places that have been my residence in the past and frankly they are a pain). My questions are 

\- any advice in general? I know the cash is a drag, fully planning on reinvesting it

\- is rental income enough to consider incorporating a business / are there significant tax advantages there?

\- does anyone have experience with hiring an accountant or financial advisor at this level of income? I don't need investment advice but I think help with taxes / tax loss harvesting / incorporating etc could be helpful and potentially could be a net plus financially

"Hold on to your arses kids, cause kanas, is going bye bye","I see beyond a few good areas in the united states, gig jobs like doordash are kinda slowing down badly. I went from making 600-700 a week on a good week to barely making 250 in the past 6 weeks. It is slowing down. This might be a good time to diversify what you do for work because even if you have a normal 9-5, businesses are slowing down.   


Walmart, Target, Fedex, and amazon are all saying they either will stop hiring all together and let people quit be the way they lay off, or hiring will only be in super busy areas. That hasnt happened in like forever so I have a feeling this aint going to be a simple recession, lasts a year or two then we are good, we are going into depression levels here. So instead of investing in new cars, new phones, etc. Make the ones you have last longer and get every cent out of them because taking on a new bill is prob the worst thing you can do now. Unless it is so broke it isnt worth saving, just dont take on new debt.

If you look at the stock market, its lost what 2-3 trillion in value in the past month. That isnt going to go well for anyone, especially service workers like us. Also we are at record amount of people that have maxed out their credit cards. Car repos are 6000 per day and expected to climb to 10-15k by end of year. Also let us not forget theres a few million evictions in progress, so this aint to recession, its a perfect depression. Our last one lasted 10 years, so keep your head on a swivel, stack those bricks of money, and be cheap as possible cause thats what is going to keep everyone safe.",doordash_drivers,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash_drivers/comments/xny26g/hold_on_to_your_arses_kids_cause_kanas_is_going/,:snoo_simple_smile:Advice:snoo_smile:,randofapper,xny26g,/r/doordash_drivers/comments/xny26g/hold_on_to_your_arses_kids_cause_kanas_is_going/,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash_drivers/comments/xny26g/hold_on_to_your_arses_kids_cause_kanas_is_going/,0,2022-09-25

"Historically bad bond market, the ""Third Great Bond Bear Market"" - The Great Bond Bubble Is ‚ÄòPoof, Gone‚Äô in Worst Year Since 1949","* **Bonds keep sliding in the face of aggressive central banks**
* **Losses mount as Fed vows to pull inflation down to 2% target**

Week by week, the bond-market crash just keeps getting worse and there‚Äôs no clear end in sight.

With central banks worldwide aggressively ratcheting up interest rates in the face of stubbornly high inflation, prices are tumbling as traders race to catch up. And with that has come a grim parade of superlatives on how bad it has become.

On Friday, **the UK‚Äôs five-year bonds tumbled by the most since at least 1992 after the government rolled out a massive tax-cut plan that may only strengthen the Bank of England‚Äôs hand. Two-year US Treasuries are in the middle of the the longest losing streak since at least 1976, dropping for 12 straight days. Worldwide, Bank of America Corp. strategists said government bond markets are on course for the worst year since 1949, when Europe was rebuilding from the ruins of World War Two.**

The escalating losses reflect how far the Federal Reserve and other central banks have shifted away from the monetary policies of the pandemic, **when they held rates near zero to keep their economies going.** The reversal has exerted a major drag on everything from stock prices to oil as investors brace for an economic slowdown.

**‚ÄúBottom line, all those years of central bank interest-rate suppression -- poof, gone,‚Äù** said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. **‚ÄúThese bonds are trading like emerging market bonds, and the biggest financial bubble in the history of bubbles, that of sovereign bonds, continues to deflate.‚Äù**

https://preview.redd.it/fwa4hkqgrxp91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdedfbdb0b8642a6e59eacfb80814744ddcd3b27

 The latest leg downward was fueled by the Fed meeting Wednesday, when the central bank raised its policy-rate range to 3% to 3.25%, **its third straight 75-basis-point hike.** **Policy makers indicated they expect to push the rate beyond 4.5% and keep it there, even if it exacts a large toll on the economy.**

Underscoring that point, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the bank **‚Äúis strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2%, and we will keep at it until the job is done.‚Äù** The broad inflation gauge that the Fed targets, the personal consumption expenditures price index, **is expected to show a 6% annual increase in August when it‚Äôs released on Sept. 30.**

The scale of the expected interest-rate hikes will likely only deepen the Treasury market‚Äôs losses, since in previous monetary-policy tightening cycles yields have tended to crest near the Fed‚Äôs target rate.

For now, **only policy-sensitive front-end Treasuries are trading at yields above 4%**, with the five-year briefly breaching that mark on Friday. Longer-dated yields are lagging the rise as traders price in the risk of a recession. **Still, the 10-year hit as much as 3.82% Friday, a 12-year high.**

**‚ÄúWith more Fed rate hiking coming and quantitative tightening, as well as the possibly more government debt issuance down the road amid less Treasury buyers out there now, it all just means higher rates,**‚Äù said Glen Capelo, managing director at Mischler Financial. **‚ÄúThe 10-year yield is definitely going to get closer to 4%.‚Äù**

In the coming week, **the market may face fresh volatility from the release of the inflation data and public speaking engagements by Fed officials including Vice Chair Lael Brainard and New York Fed President John Williams.** Also, **the sale of new two-, five- and seven-year Treasuries will likely spur trading volatility in those benchmarks, since the market typically seeks a price concession before the auctions**. The week will also mark the end of the month and the quarter, usually a time of diminished liquidity and elevated volatility as money managers adjust holdings.

A broad Treasury index has been swamped by escalating losses and **is heading for a drop of over 2.7% in September, its worst since April. It‚Äôs down over 12% this year.**

‚ÄúWhether 4.6% is the peak rate or they have to go further depends on the inflation trend,‚Äù said Andrzej Skiba, head of the BlueBay US fixed-income team at RBC Global Asset Management, who is cautious about being exposed to longer-dated interest-rate risk. **‚ÄúThe market is totally at the mercy of incoming inflation data, and while our view is that inflation will decline, the degree of confidence in that forecast is low.‚Äù**

Here‚Äôs the scoop.  For those that are seeing the IV jump to now near 460% at some strikes, be extremely cautious.  The reason that it has jumped is because of Supply and demand.  The MM creates a wide spread between bid and ask, praying that retail buys short dated options.  They cash in on this high volatility, because they make you pay a higher ask, higher strike (for affordability) hoping to collect the premium rather then exercise for shares.  Yes, the gains could be exponential, but the risk is 90.8% greater of losing it all, and the MM ability to drive the price down is greater.  IV is always going to be high in a bearish market.  IMO this Is a trap, here‚Äôs y‚Ä¶

Liquidity has been a noticeable nightmare for well over a week.  Utilization 100%.  CTB climbing, as well as SI.  Volume has dried up, and short exempts are become a every day reality.  The last thing SUS wanted was news.    The only hope they had of getting out of this was a delisting, or non-compliance.  They need liquidity, and the only was they get out is through Options at this point. They shoot up  the IV giving the appearance of a B massive run, and crush it, get the liquidity and drive out to sub 90 cents again.  Your choices are simple, but the stock, or don‚Äôt bitch when we go to $1.94, and get hammered back down to 90 cents in a week.

Buy the damn stock, leave the options ALONE. We create more pressure by purchasing the stock, and can protect the options that have already been purchased.  That‚Äôs what will one day create the GAMMA ramp we‚Äôve been begging for over a year.  Buying the stock Monday morning and all day long will create exempts, Threshold List, more issues.  A pressurized cooker, that with a merger, a new BOD, and many other pr options will cause this thing to erupt to ATH. 

Last but not least. If you‚Äôre not spreading the word, you‚Äôre not in the game.  We should be most active and new watchers list on ST. Should be trending on Twitter #1.  Get out there and get typing. Shits been exposed. And we should all be bragging.

"The Great Bond Bubble Is ‚ÄòPoof, Gone‚Äô in Worst Year Since 1949","* **Bonds keep sliding in the face of aggressive central banks**
* **Losses mount as Fed vows to pull inflation down to 2% target**

Week by week, the bond-market crash just keeps getting worse and there‚Äôs no clear end in sight.

With central banks worldwide aggressively ratcheting up interest rates in the face of stubbornly high inflation, prices are tumbling as traders race to catch up. And with that has come a grim parade of superlatives on how bad it has become.

On Friday, **the UK‚Äôs five-year bonds tumbled by the most since at least 1992 after the government rolled out a massive tax-cut plan that may only strengthen the Bank of England‚Äôs hand. Two-year US Treasuries are in the middle of the the longest losing streak since at least 1976, dropping for 12 straight days. Worldwide, Bank of America Corp. strategists said government bond markets are on course for the worst year since 1949, when Europe was rebuilding from the ruins of World War Two.**

The escalating losses reflect how far the Federal Reserve and other central banks have shifted away from the monetary policies of the pandemic, **when they held rates near zero to keep their economies going.** The reversal has exerted a major drag on everything from stock prices to oil as investors brace for an economic slowdown.

**‚ÄúBottom line, all those years of central bank interest-rate suppression -- poof, gone,‚Äù** said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. **‚ÄúThese bonds are trading like emerging market bonds, and the biggest financial bubble in the history of bubbles, that of sovereign bonds, continues to deflate.‚Äù**

https://preview.redd.it/gh0zd5wzoxp91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=99849725264402a857ced0680ec09c3b8bd7a738

The latest leg downward was fueled by the Fed meeting Wednesday, when the central bank raised its policy-rate range to 3% to 3.25%, **its third straight 75-basis-point hike.** **Policy makers indicated they expect to push the rate beyond 4.5% and keep it there, even if it exacts a large toll on the economy.** 

Underscoring that point, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the bank **‚Äúis strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2%, and we will keep at it until the job is done.‚Äù** The broad inflation gauge that the Fed targets, the personal consumption expenditures price index, **is expected to show a 6% annual increase in August when it‚Äôs released on Sept. 30.**

The scale of the expected interest-rate hikes will likely only deepen the Treasury market‚Äôs losses, since in previous monetary-policy tightening cycles yields have tended to crest near the Fed‚Äôs target rate. 

For now, **only policy-sensitive front-end Treasuries are trading at yields above 4%**, with the five-year briefly breaching that mark on Friday. Longer-dated yields are lagging the rise as traders price in the risk of a recession. **Still, the 10-year hit as much as 3.82% Friday, a 12-year high.**

**‚ÄúWith more Fed rate hiking coming and quantitative tightening, as well as the possibly more government debt issuance down the road amid less Treasury buyers out there now, it all just means higher rates,**‚Äù said Glen Capelo, managing director at Mischler Financial. **‚ÄúThe 10-year yield is definitely going to get closer to 4%.‚Äù**

In the coming week, **the market may face fresh volatility from the release of the inflation data and public speaking engagements by Fed officials including Vice Chair Lael Brainard and New York Fed President John Williams.** Also, **the sale of new two-, five- and seven-year Treasuries will likely spur trading volatility in those benchmarks, since the market typically seeks a price concession before the auctions**. The week will also mark the end of the month and the quarter, usually a time of diminished liquidity and elevated volatility as money managers adjust holdings.

A broad Treasury index has been swamped by escalating losses and **is heading for a drop of over 2.7% in September, its worst since April. It‚Äôs down over 12% this year.** 

‚ÄúWhether 4.6% is the peak rate or they have to go further depends on the inflation trend,‚Äù said Andrzej Skiba, head of the BlueBay US fixed-income team at RBC Global Asset Management, who is cautious about being exposed to longer-dated interest-rate risk. **‚ÄúThe market is totally at the mercy of incoming inflation data, and while our view is that inflation will decline, the degree of confidence in that forecast is low.‚Äù**

[F4A][F4Monsters] Catwomen used as breeding stock in a medieval fantasy/D&amp;D style universe [Noncon],"It is well known that the human-like species of cat-fey known simply as Feykits are prized for their abnormal beauty and fertile bodies. With the proportions of a short, lithe human woman and the ears and tail of many cat breeds ranging from domestic to exotic, they've become popular in the empire of Derwenne in recent years. And while one or two became the pets and playthings of rich merchants and lower nobles for their appearance alone, it was their second attribute that spawned an international trading circuit of Feykits.

Feykits are most known for their tight pussies yet elastic bodies, easily stretching to fit something three or four times the size of average human or elf cock. Which while that makes them excellent sex toys, their high fertility rate means they're used for more than personal harems. Feykits are in a near constant state of heat, which attracts any and all creatures nearby to breed her body.

This means the market for Feykits tends to be one of three demographics: Adventurers, Scholars, and Ranchers.

Adventurers that can afford a Feykit like to keep one around to throw into a dungeon before them, using her as bait to distract the lesser monsters and sometimes even the boss monster waiting at the end. Swarmed by draugrs, living skeletons, wolves, slimes, lesser vampires, goblins, ghosts, golems, and more, the dungeon enemies busy themselves with breeding the fertile Feykit's womb, and the Adventurer is free to loot the dungeon at his leisure. Additionally the Adventurer gets a free show, which Feykit Merchants hear is a popular benefit to their purchase. Should the Feykit conceive from one or more of the monsters within the dungeon, several Scholars and Ranchers will pay top dollar for the resulting offspring.

Scholars dedicating themselves to the study of monsterkind seek out Feykits for their research projects more frequently than you might expect. Feykits conceive quickly and often, with the pregnancy only lasting a few days if not hours. And when a monster is produced from the union of beast and Feykit, there is usually very little genetic evidence of the mother, the monster taking on all the qualities of the father. *However*, the offspring of monster and Feykit are almost always stronger than the pure species, which has led to a great deal of study on the part of Bestiary Scholars. They hope to be able to use these findings for a myriad of research, including domestication. Many see this as an opportunity to domesticate some of the fiercest predators that threaten sentient kind from Elves and Orcs down to humans and Dwarves. Dragons, chimera, and krakens are just a few of the apex predators these scholars have their eyes on domesticating.

Ranchers that deal in both farm-stock and monster-stock could find no better purchase than a Feykit or two. With how quickly they conceive, it allows Ranchers to have a high turnover rate. They can repopulate a dungeon in as little as a month with a single Feykit, and with the more they have the faster they can do it. Their offspring are stronger, healthier, which yields in better product whether it be for dungeons, farms, or even the Empire's royal platoon of Pegasus Knights. Thanks to Feykit breeding, their Pegasi are the strongest mounted military several nations over. From the ranch's herding dog to Pegasi and Unicorns, Feykits are an invaluable source of production.

With so many different ways to use your newly purchased Feykit, which path of success will *you,* savvy entrepreneur, undertake?

Good evening Reddit. If it wasn't obvious, I'd like to play as a neko in a fantasy setting that's used as little more than a breeding hole for monsters, beasts, and even humanoids. While we can certainly keep it villain if you'd like, the more wild and weird the better if you're interested in exploring breeding opportunities with things such as draugrs, dragons, slimes, and any other weird d&amp;d or video game monster you can think of.

While I'd prefer this to be on the smut heavy side of things, I'm open to discussing some sort of plot. I'm also opening to doubling if that's something that would make it more fun for you (where we both get a main character to play against a horde of monsters or whatever it is you fancy).

**Kinks:** Breeding, non-con, dub-con, cervical penetration, stomach bulge, oviposition, egg laying, man handling, man handling via tail, monsters, gangbang, forced public, bred for profit, bred for science, breeding bench, ripped clothes, cmnf, collars, human sex toy, and more

**Limits:** Death, gore, toilet play, scent play, unhygienic (smegma, farting, musk, emphasis on dirt, etc), feet, armpits, farting, smoking, drugs, alcohol, knife play, burn play, latex, diapers, ddlg

"Alternative data point: high frequency trading firms and hedge funds are paying interns 296k/year, a huge increase from before","[https://www.levels.fyi/internships/](https://www.levels.fyi/internships/)

I think we can speculate that they believe the stock market will be in a recession and quite volatile for quite some time because if they're paying interns this much, it's in anticipation of big future profits (next 3+ years, summer 2023 interns graduate in summer 2024 and will only start being productive to the company in 2025). For those who don't know, HFTs and hedge funds make insane profits during recessions and high volatility, while they underperform the market during good times.

Why trust this? HFTs and hedge funds like Optiver, Jane Street, and Citadel employ some of the smartest people in finance in the world.

I don't understand the hype over Gamestop,"Had three associates trying to pitch Gamestop to me in the past week and how I'll be missing on a huge opportunity. They're showing me all the DD from Superstonk. They were so hyped and excited that I didn't have the heart to tell them I already know about the whole GME saga or why I don't want to buy in. 

Read the DD but I still don't understand why people are so certain that GME will moon. What makes the company worth it? It's a brick and mortar for video games in a world where digital delivery is growing. Yes they have no debt and inventory but so what? The biggest reason that Gamestop was successful in the first place was because they made bank off of the used game racket which is no longer as lucrative. 

The NFT marketplace? Gaming via their NFT market? What's that supposed to do? We already have gacha/loot boxes for people that want to shell out $ for jpegs. We already have a plethora of gaming platforms such as Steam. How are they going to compete with the big boy developers?  Anyone remember Diablo 3 Real Money Auction House? LOL that was a mess. 

I just don't get it. All the talk about 100% DRS, MOASS, Citadel, shitfuckery doesn't answer my question.

Birmintrix wealth is committed to providing customers with efficient and convenient one-stop services through high-quality platforms. With the rich experience of the expert team and the classic cases of financial engineering research and development for decades, it helps users master the cutting-edge trends, match the most efficient investment subscription services, far ahead of other peers, and quickly achieve the wealth goal.

**Birmintrix focuses on user experience, focusing on user profits**

Kamal ReNu lent the funds to birmintrix wealth as the principal of user experience funds, and distributed different experience funds to the app according to the user application information. During the experience of quantitative trading products of special investment loans, users need to click repayment every day, return the daily principal and fixed interest, and obtain the residual income of product trading at the same time. The company has a long-term and stable partnership with Kamal. Birmintrix has a US $100billion credit line in Kamal every year. Birmintrix makes full use of these funds and uses them to help users reduce the participation threshold of foreign exchange financial products.

**Birmintrix high-frequency trading strategy automation and efficient profit**

High frequency trading is a form of automated trading. It uses complex computer technology and software systems to execute transactions at a very fast speed and hold positions for a short time within a day. Its core is fast trading, especially relying on computing power.

The characteristics of high-frequency trading are as follows:

(1) It is a programmed transaction automatically completed by the computer;

(2) Its position holding time is very short, and the number of intra day transactions is very frequent;

(3) Its yield per transaction is very low;

(4) Its trading volume is so huge that you can't imagine it.

It is a computerized transaction that seeks profits in the extremely short-term market changes that people can't take advantage of. For example, it is easier to understand, the small change of the difference between the buying price and selling price of a stock, or the small price difference between different exchanges of a stock. The speed of this kind of transaction is as fast as a beam of light, so that some trading institutions place their ""server farms"" close to the computer of the exchange to shorten the distance that trading instructions travel at the speed of light through optical cables.

**Foreign exchange grid Trading Strategy grasps the pulse of the market and grasps the interest entrance in the market shock**

The foreign exchange grid trading method is also known as the fishnet trading method. The specific operation strategy of the foreign exchange grid trading method is to take a certain point as the base point, hang a certain number of empty orders and multiple orders for each rise or fall of a certain number of points, set a profit target, but do not set a stop loss, make a profit when the price moves in the desired direction, close the position, and hang the same buy order and sell order at the origin. These trading orders thus placed form a fishnet like array, making profits back and forth in the volatile foreign exchange market. There are also things to pay attention to when using the foreign exchange grid trading method. What traders need to pay attention to is that the grid trading method is most taboo against unilateral market prices, and is designed for oscillating market prices. Its advantage in arbitrage trading is that it can systematically manage large capital transactions.

Advantages and disadvantages of shock grid trading method: like to be a Huiyou of shock market, and strive to earn profit opportunities in shock range through long and short price fluctuations. In a volatile market, there are so many trading opportunities that people can't help placing orders. It is important to remember that profits and losses are relative. Only controlling within a reasonable asset management range is the way to stabilize profits.

Under the radar,"Ive been interested and researching Drive Shack for a while, full disclosure I started buying when it broke below the 1 dollar level last week.  Part of my thesis is that the reason for the stock collapse is based on fear that the company will not be able to raise the money that they need in order to continue opening Puttery venues.  Looking back through their old earnings calls and presentations, it seems they were expected to do a debt capital raise early this year and ended up not doing that when the cost of capital began to rise. On the last earnings call they mention that they are considering selling assets instead of accessing debt, which I actually thought sounded like a better idea as they have some great assets that they can sell. 

Another risk/fear I see about this company is the risk of them going BK.  But, in doing further research, it turns out this company used to be a REIT called Newcastle, and was owned by Fortress. That company turned into Drive Shack which made the shift to a golf entertainment company but got to bring with it over 400M in NOLs that they can carry forward for when they begin to make profits. Another part of my thesis is that because the NOLs are such a valuable asset, their BOD will not let the company fall into BK because that would be the only way they could lose those NOLs. The chairman of the board is a co-founder of Fortress and currently holds the largest position in this company. He bought 4M more shares at the end of May which showed a great deal of confidence IMO.

The Puttery venues have opened much slower than what was said in prior presentations, and that is one reason I have held off until it fell through the dollar level, but numbers on the venues that have opened are looking like cash cows, on pace to EBITDA 2-3M/yr while only costing about 10M/venue to build which are GREAT MARGINS!  So if those numbers continue to track this is will be a huge cash flowing company as they get more venues up and running. 

I like that Rory MciLroy is backing them and has invested 10M to be a partner in the puttery venues. I also like that the Chairman of the board has such a large position in the company and continues to buy shares on the open market.  I do not like that they have not raised their additional funding yet, but at the current levels it is such a good risk/reward IMO that I had to start nibbling.

The ironical position Adani can get himself into,"*lamba post hai, popcorn ya haldirams ka burji leke aana""

As you know, Gautam Adani is the second richest man in the world currently according to Forbes. While the inner  economists in me disagrees with Forbes rating methodology, as they have failed to account for the PPP and people who are actually rich due to generational wealth but are politically influential enough to remove their name out of the public spotlight. 

At the end of the day Forbes is in many regards a publication house that is struggling to find a foothold on the internet. We all know Adani has benefited from a favorable political environment, but the tricky part of  politics globally is that it's always unpredictable and if you screw up bad enough, no politician will even acknowledge you are there. And when you are soo big you will eventually screw up.

Never the less of my issues with Forbes, Adani is still extremely and incomprehensibly rich. But this richness isn't necessarily In cash or liquid wealth but due to the market valuations of stocks. 

His network, whatever it may be is only a weighted average of his shareholding in various companies and  the current market value of the companies. If he even sells 1% of his stake, forget about the regulatory nightmare and the hell the directors will put him through, it could also lead to his 99% of him stock crashing in value because, let's be honest , Adani stocks are quite overvalued either because of the animal spirits, market speculators or any other reason.

To tackle this liquidity issue, Adani has no choice really but to take a loan and keep his stocks has a collateral. But again he is playing with fire here because you will have to pay the loans via cash flow only. If you were getting cash flows why in Gods name do you need to pledge shares for liquidity only to spend it to buy another company  and repeat the cycle again. If you are cash rich, you can always announce a buy back of your shares, store higher reserves and then finally use your reserves to buy another company. Or simply declare less dividends and save the money to expand.

You could pledge your entire holdings but either banks are dumb, politically compromised or greedy in order to give such massive amounts of loans if there are uncertainty about cash flows. Since I speculate a lot of these loans are off balance sheet items, we can't know the exact terms. 

You can control expenses and cost to an extent but you can not control profits. Depending on the nature of the industry and type of product or service being offered, your cash may be stuck for years on end. How can one ascertain a stable cash flow that way. Ya in the balance sheet the ratios may show a good figure, but we don't exactly know what is the real debt exposure.

Adnai stocks grew in periods of low interest rates, and where the market was undervalued because of COVID. We are seeing soo much macro fluctuations within only one year. Adani has some moats and key industries and those companies are good, but I can't say for certain if they are good enough to justify such borrowing practices. Let's hope their risk management division has some of the best talent in the world. Its not impossible to navigate through this but it wasn't the smartest choice to expand soo agressively in the first place.

[F4A][F4Monsters] Catgirls used as breeding stock in a medieval fantasy/D&amp;D style universe [Noncon],"It is well known that the human-like species of cat-fey known simply as Feykits are prized for their abnormal beauty and fertile bodies. With the proportions of a short, lithe human woman and the ears and tail of many cat breeds ranging from domestic to exotic, they've become popular in the empire of Derwenne in recent years. And while one or two became the pets and playthings of rich merchants and lower nobles for their appearance alone, it was their second attribute that spawned an international trading circuit of Feykits.

Feykits are most known for their tight pussies yet elastic bodies, easily stretching to fit something three or four times the size of average human or elf cock. Which while that makes them excellent sex toys, their high fertility rate means they're used for more than personal harems. Feykits are in a near constant state of heat, which attracts any and all creatures nearby to breed her body.

This means the market for Feykits tends to be one of three demographics: Adventurers, Scholars, and Ranchers.

Adventurers that can afford a Feykit like to keep one around to throw into a dungeon before them, using her as bait to distract the lesser monsters and sometimes even the boss monster waiting at the end. Swarmed by draugrs, living skeletons, wolves, slimes, lesser vampires, goblins, ghosts, golems, and more, the dungeon enemies busy themselves with breeding the fertile catgirl's womb, and the Adventurer is free to loot the dungeon at his leisure. Additionally the Adventurer gets a free show, which Feykit Merchants hear is a popular benefit to their purchase. Should the Feykit conceive from one or more of the monsters within the dungeon, several Scholars and Ranchers will pay top dollar for the resulting offspring.

Scholars dedicating themselves to the study of monsterkind seek out Feykits for their research projects more frequently than you might expect. Feykits conceive quickly and often, with the pregnancy only lasting a few days if not hours. And when a monster is produced from the union of beast and Feykit, there is usually very little genetic evidence of the mother, the monster taking on all the qualities of the father. *However*, the offspring of monster and Feykit are almost always stronger than the pure species, which has led to a great deal of study on the part of Bestiary Scholars. They hope to be able to use these findings for a myriad of research, including domestication. Many see this as an opportunity to domesticate some of the fiercest predators that threaten sentient kind from Elves and Orcs down to humans and Dwarves. Dragons, chimera, and krakens are just a few of the apex predators these scholars have their eyes on domesticating.

Ranchers that deal in both farm-stock and monster-stock could find no better purchase than a Feykit or two. With how quickly they conceive, it allows Ranchers to have a high turnover rate. They can repopulate a dungeon in as little as a month with a single Feykit, and with the more they have the faster they can do it. Their offspring are stronger, healthier, which yields in better product whether it be for dungeons, farms, or even the Empire's royal platoon of Pegasus Knights. Thanks to Feykit breeding, their Pegasi are the strongest mounted military several nations over. From the ranch's herding dog to Pegasi and Unicorns, Feykits are an invaluable source of production.

With so many different ways to use your newly purchased Feykit, which path of success will *you,* savvy entrepreneur, undertake?

Good evening Reddit. If it wasn't obvious, I'd like to play as a catgirl in a fantasy setting that's used as little more than a breeding hole for monsters, beasts, and even humanoids. While we can certainly keep it villain if you'd like, the more wild and weird the better if you're interested in exploring breeding opportunities with things such as draugrs, dragons, slimes, and any other weird d&amp;d or video game monster you can think of.

While I'd prefer this to be on the smut heavy side of things, I'm open to discussing some sort of plot. I'm also opening to doubling if that's something that would make it more fun for you (where we both get a main character to play against a horde of monsters or whatever it is you fancy).

**Kinks:** Breeding, non-con, dub-con, cervical penetration, stomach bulge, oviposition, egg laying, man handling, man handling via tail, monsters, gangbang, forced public, bred for profit, bred for science, breeding bench, ripped clothes, cmnf, collars, human sex toy, and more

**Limits:** Death, gore, toilet play, scent play, unhygienic (smegma, farting, musk, emphasis on dirt, etc), feet, armpits, farting, smoking, drugs, alcohol, knife play, burn play, latex, diapers, ddlg

High-Tech Stocks That Are Too Cheap To Ignore,"These six high-tech stocks are too cheap to ignore. The growth rates, low price-earnings multiples and high yields make them attractive value and growth stocks at the same time.

Moreover, each of these tech stocks pays a solid dividend, has positive excess free cash flow (FCF), and most of them have share buyback programs. The latter helps increase the earnings per share (EPS) and the dividend per share (DPS), as well as helps push the stocks higher.

Given the recent downturn in stocks, now is a good time to begin averaging into these stocks. This is because their valuations reflect a good deal of bad news now and fears of a recession seem to be ‚Äúin‚Äù the stock prices.

Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a memory and storage semiconductor chip maker that is forecast to produce 31% earnings growth by August 2023. For example, earnings per share (EPS) is projected by analysts to grow from $9.58 per share this year to $12.56 next year. At a price of $55.01 at the close on June 16, that puts its P/E multiple for 2023 at just 4.4x. That makes it one of the least inexpensive high-tech stocks.

Moreover, with its huge free cash flow, MU stock is able to pay out a dividend of 40 cents per share. Its $9.58 EPS this year will have no problem covering this dividend, given the stock a 0.7% dividend yield. In fact, there is probably room for the company to raise the dividend. So far, Micron likes to use its excess free cash flow to buy back shares given its robust share repurchase program. It bought back $408 million in its latest quarter ending March 3, which works out to about 2.5% of its market cap on an annualized basis. 

So, along with its cheap valuation and growing earnings, its buyback program will act as a catalyst to help push the stock higher. No wonder the average price target of 18 analysts surveyed by [TipRanks.com](https://TipRanks.com) is $109 per share, or double today‚Äôs stock price.

Chegg (NYSE:CHGG) is an educational software direct-to-student learning platform that is forecast to grow 14% in 2023. For example, the average of 12 analysts surveyed by Seeking Alpha is that Chegg will produce EPS of $1.22 in 2023. That puts CHGG stock, at Thursday‚Äôs closing price of $17.02 at 13.9x times earnings. This is well below its historical average of 47.5x over the past five years, according to [Morningstar.com](https://Morningstar.com). In fact, even at 50% of that average, CHGG should trade at 23.75x, which is 72% over today‚Äôs valuation metric.

Moreover, the company announced on June 2 that it is doubling its $1 billion buyback program to $2 billion. It only had $65 million remaining from its prior $1 billion program, so in effect, it was re-upping the $1 billion program. In fact, in the first quarter, the company spent $300 million on its accelerated share repurchase, which was completed in April. The company has plenty of FCF to fund its buybacks. The Q1, FCF was $50.5 million, which works out to 25% of its sales. That is a very high FCF margin and is the basis for the company‚Äôs confidence in re-upping its $1 billion buyback program.

As if that is not enough of a catalyst for CHGG stock, management has been buying shares. Insiders, specifically the CEO, the chief financial officer (CFO) and a director, were buying CHGG stock at the end of last year, based on information from [Openinsider.com](https://Openinsider.com).

Find all the answers in this blog.

[Quarterly change in U.S. gross domestic product.](https://preview.redd.it/97xwfmg35yp91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58b4da8cab49604cff87d517ef01767513fcbf3d)

## What Is a Worldwide Recession?

A worldwide recession (or global recession) is an extended period of economic decline around the world, involving more or less synchronized recessions across many national economies. To classify as a recession, macroeconomic indicators have to wane for a significant period of time. For example, in the U.S., the rule of thumb is that GDP must drop for two consecutive quarters for a true recession to happen.

## Worst Worldwide Recessions in History

Over the centuries there have been several global recessions that have wrought havoc on national finances and family incomes. Only from 1950 till now, the world economy has gone through four global recessions: 1975, 1982, 1991, and 2009. And here are some of the worst recessions in history:

### Long Depression (1873 ‚Äì 1896)

The Long Depression began on Black Friday, 9 May 1873 with the collapse of the Vienna Stock Exchange, followed by bank failures in Austria and then in Germany, resulting in a nearly two-decade-long period of economic stagnation.

### Great Depression (1929 ‚Äì 1939)

The Great Depression took place on Oct. 24, 1929, with the crash of the U.S. stock market, resulting in a depression that would plague the nation for a decade. After only four years (1933), unemployment was at 25 percent and more than 5,000 banks went out of business.

[The Great Depression lasted for a decade.](https://preview.redd.it/ecl1xew75yp91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2913a4edc4594edc88627e29f9c81837e345296)

### Great Recession (2007 ‚Äì 2009)

The Great Recession began in December 2007 with the collapse of the housing market, fueled by low-interest rates, easy credit, insufficient regulation, and toxic subprime mortgages. This recession is considered the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, resulting in U.S. GDP declining by 0.3% in 2008 and 2.8% in 2009, and unemployment briefly reaching 10%.

## Is a Worldwide Recession Coming in 2022?

Inflation is currently at a 40-year high. Interest rates have been raised for the fifth time. And gas prices have even passed the frightening $5 a gallon. Some might tell you we are already in a recession or one is inevitable. Technically, two-quarters of a consecutive decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is enough to determine a recession, which means the US could already be said to be experiencing a recession. However, according to economic experts, this technical definition is no perfect indicator. There are no yet signs of a recession as the labor market is actually doing well.

As the world is still reeling from the COVID pandemic and Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine, the economy is facing an increasingly murky and uncertain outlook. With inflation continuing to increase, the probability of a world economic recession gets higher. According to a Bloomberg survey of economists completed, the median probability of a recession over the next 12 months is 47.5%, up from 30% in June.

## How to Prepare for a Worldwide Recession?

In the worst-case scenario, if the worldwide recession is really coming, here are some financial moves you can make to prepare:

### Don‚Äôt be petrified of a bear market

If you are a long-term investor, look at this as an opportunity. In such a situation, you should shift your focus to companies that have strong balance sheets, strong cash flow, and products that are in high demand.

### Don‚Äôt try to time the market because you cannot

No one knows the best time to get out and when to jump back in the market, so do not try to time it. The best thing to do is to avoid making outsized allocation adjustments until things ease up.

[Pay your credit card debt ASAP.](https://preview.redd.it/sq9snpyh5yp91.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74a328d7c38e90fdf3bfe1fd68a0b0fe3827a867)

### Get rid of your credit card debt immediately

As interest rates are rising rapidly, it is a priority to pay off your balances as soon as possible. You can also consider getting a low-interest personal loan or signing up for a balance-transfer credit card to transfer high-interest debt to a credit card with a 0 percent rate.

### Save, save, and save

A recession can quickly change your circumstances, so you never know what happens next. If you have an upcoming vacation, cancel it, and save money.

### Set backup plans

Apart from saving, you should also figure out where you might go for additional funds if you need them in a pinch.

### Add bonds to your portfolio

Recent recessions show that bonds have held up better than nearly any other market segment. They might not perform well now, but they are an essential portfolio ingredient, especially for people who are in or getting close to retirement.

### Get a side job

A second job helps boost your income and savings. You can also consider getting a job in transportation, warehousing, leisure and hospitality, education, health services, and government for a more secure position in a recession.

"People at J1 are very nice, good wlb but I hate the work","I have already accepted another position which will start in about a month. Jn pays 20% higher than J1 and their stock price is more resilient than J1. J1's stock tanked badly and gave me lot of headache last year. Joining Jn would also help with any upside during the market recovery phase post recession.

I can't keep both J1 and Jn because of Jn-1s. I kind of like people at J1. My current manager is very nice but the work here sucks. I don't expect promotion and never even bring it up. The work is boring and I don't feel excited to work. One could argue that J1 has all the attributes of OE lol! Jn is also remote.

"Real live leaked right wing sex videos plan to be leaked out: The hard cold rodents of counter intelligence 2023 Stock market collapse , housing bubble and why Redbar is being pumped deliberately by YouTube.","This is the second part of my recent discoveries of the inner workings of the stock market and how it led to information regarding an upcoming right wing sex video leak of massive proportions.

After making reading through various leaks on 4chan, requesting and obtaining FOIA documents, meeting anons in real life and on discord....I made the first post on Reddit, kiwi, 4chan , 8kun, and various other communities and sites.
The post was largely ignored but I have been able to gain more people in my network that seem to know what is currently really going on with the world economy and what the reality says about various military and mafioso threats across the world.

I am currently working a deal out with CNN, FOX news and will be on OAN next Saturday and will also be featured on INFO WARS the week after Halloween.

Looking for Intake Manifold Ideas,"1988 Chevrolet C1500 Scottsdale with 305. I am looking into options for intake manifolds. Everything is bone stock, and I'd like to keep most of it that way. Will be installing a 2.5"" dual exhaust, K&amp;N Hi-Flow AirCharger and not much else. I know that most of the restrictions on the 305 are in the heads and the cam but I don't care too much to tear down a solid engine. 

I was looking into the Edlebrock 3704, wanted to see what others thought about it or if y'all had any better suggestions, because personally I believe that the 3704 is overpriced for what it is, however it does seem to bolt-up and require no further modifications for it to work. Trying to stay away from needing a throttle body spacer, after-market throttle cable bracket, or needing to modify brackets for the A/C compressor or alternator. 

Let me know what y'all got, thanks.",ChevyTrucks,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChevyTrucks/comments/xngceu/looking_for_intake_manifold_ideas/,,C_Guzman25,xngceu,/r/ChevyTrucks/comments/xngceu/looking_for_intake_manifold_ideas/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChevyTrucks/comments/xngceu/looking_for_intake_manifold_ideas/,0,2022-09-25
Moscow stock exchange is preparing a bill to allow the trade of DFAs," 

**We want the market to make its own choice between blockchain accounting and depositary accounting: Chairman**

The Moscow Stock Exchange (MOEX) has decided to introduce a bill that will allow depositaries to issue receipts for trade in digital financial assets (DFAs), Russian newspaper Vedomosti reported earlier this week.

The bill is currently under consideration by the Russian Central Bank, which independently cannot introduce legislation. ¬†

MOEX supervisory board chair Sergei Shvetsov told reporters at a banking forum, ‚ÄúBanks of Russia ‚Äì XXI century,‚Äù that the bill will allow trading both in DFAs and securities based on them.

This will allow investors to choose between directly investing in DFAs or shifting the custodial risks of opening accounts in distributed registries to the accounting infrastructure via securities.

*‚ÄúThe exchange and its subsidiaries will turn to the regulator, and I hope that they will receive the status of an exchange operator,‚Äù*¬†the chairman explained, referring to how the direct release of DFAs will work.

Discord Update - 25/09/2022 - Launchpad almost here!,"# Launchpad Launches on 29th September

The big news of the week is that the Octorand Launchpad will launch on the 29th.    This give Algorand users access to two new exciting NFT collections - built on the Octorand ecosystem

So... who are these new kids on the block - and why should we be getting excited about them?  

Lets dive in and compare them:

# Guardians

[A Guardian - https:\/\/twitter.com\/TatariGuardians\/status\/1569555996846231552\/photo\/1 has a animated version](https://preview.redd.it/6nygnz7v11q91.png?width=812&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9e1e13b853fc51979e984161abe25d64307e2e3)

   * Discord: [https://discord.gg/D8CQM32j](https://discord.gg/D8CQM32j)
   * Twitter: [https://twitter.com/TatariGuardians/](https://twitter.com/TatariGuardians/)
* Created by Octorand Discord user **Tatari**
* 1000 Guardians will be minted
* Guardians will have a randomly allocated 50-100 GUARD tokens available for the owner to collect on mint
*  GUARD Tokenomics
* 100,000 GUARD tokens will be minted (that's the maximum there will ever be)
   *  I assume the treasury will consist of all the GUARD tokens not allocated to Guardians - but I couldn't find that written explicitly
   * 70% of GUARD tokens ""spent"" will be burnt - 30% will go to the treasury
* What can I do with GUARD tokens?
   * They can be spent for a chance to win prizes
   * You will eventually be able to change the traits of your Guardian - although that functionality will not be available at launch

# Takos

&amp;#x200B;

[The Tako won by Two\_More\_Times on Twitter](https://preview.redd.it/nymvjc4j11q91.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55f2768d619f418a8b26d035a401df41ca428f1a)

   * [https://discord.gg/68BNha8j](https://discord.gg/68BNha8j)
* Created by Octorand Discord user **JonahWhale**
* 1888 Tako will be minted - 1800 will be available - 88 will be 'treasury stock'
* Tako will have ""an average of 4"" traits (from a possible 50) 
* Tako will have a randomly allocated 60-100 TAKO tokens available for the owner to collect on mint
* TAKO Tokenomics
   * 180,000 TAKO tokens will be minted (that's the maximum there will ever be)
   * of this total - 25,000 TAKO make up the Treasury (along with any not used up in the mint)
   * 70% of TAKO tokens ""spent"" will be burnt - 30% will go to the treasury
* What can I do with TAKO?
   * There are a variety of games that the Tako project plans to release in the coming months and beyond.  

# Both projects:

* The NFTs will be standard ASAs (Algorand Standard Assets) - so you'll be able to see them in your wallet and on secondary markets
* They can be swapped or sold like any other ASA - and should be available on your secondary market of choice when the creators get them signed up.  We'd obviously prefer users to complete secondary sales through the Octorand Launchpad - as that gives us a slither of the fees to further grow the Octorand ecosystem (which is completely volunteer based at the moment).   But you don't \_have\_ to.   
* The ASAs use ARC19 and ARC69 to make traits and images changeable - this should mean your wallet and secondary markets will display them properly,
* Though neither of these projects are ""Octorand"" projects - and are owned completely by the creators - Declan has spent time working with both creators to make sure this process will be smooth for everyone concerned. 

# Listening is the new reading...

# General advice

Having watched the successful launch of Octorand Gen1 and Gen2's first hand.... I would imagine that enthusiasm is going to be high on both projects.    

If the mint works the same way as the Gen2 launch - then assets will be made available for purchase in batches... so don't assume that a ""none currently for sale"" screen in the first few hours is your chance ruined.

Times will be announced as we get closer to the 29th - so it's even more important than usual to monitor the discords and twitter accounts of the projects in question for more details.

I'd be expecting some extreme volatility in GUARD and TAKO prices initially - as the new kids find their levels on the charts.

Intentional hostile take over of a company to prevent a short squeeze. This is a new strategy by hedge funds and market makers,"I'm invested in a stock that no longer has 3 people, of which 2 were members on the board, the other was a CFO. All three of these individuals were forced to resign  though the courts. The stock has 100% utilization, 20% SI, a merger in the works, valuation of the merging companies, and a good earnings report to be announced. Hedge funds are finding different ways to prevent short squeezes and bankrupt companies. This stock is a prime example of market manipulation with the use of insiders trying to destroy the company. They almost succeeded in doing this, but after two months of court the judge put a stop to it. The company can move forward now. The point of this is that your stocks are now being manipulated from inside and the crimes being committed are Bernie Madoff style. Don't think for a second your stock is being controlled just in the market. Hedge funds are going after the companies on the inside now.

Buying the Stock-Market Dip Is Backfiring This Year,"Share prices continue to plunge, denting a strategy that soared in popularity over the past decade

https://www.wsj.com/articles/buying-the-stock-market-dip-is-backfiring-this-year-11664064845?mod=hp_lead_pos1

It is the worst year for buying the stock-market dip since the 1930s.  

Instead of rebounding after a tumble, stocks have continued to fall, burning investors who stepped in to buy shares on sale. The S&amp;P 500 has dropped 1.2% on average this year in the week after a one-day loss of at least 1%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That is the biggest such decline since 1931.

The extended downturn is putting a dent in the popular buy-the-dip trade, a strategy in which many investors found great success after the last financial crisis and particularly during the lightning-fast pandemic recovery.

Major stock indexes hit dozens of continuous records, convincing many investors that any downturn would be short-lived‚Äîand an attractive opportunity to buy.

The trade has backfired during the monthslong downturn that has dragged the S&amp;P 500 down 23% so far in 2022, on track for its biggest annual decline since 2008. The selloff accelerated last week when central banks around the world increased interest rates, driving sharp swings across stock, bond and currency markets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell at least 4%, their fourth decline of at least 3% in five weeks.

Many investors have been wrestling with high inflation, a continuing war in Europe and the prospect of a recession. In the days ahead, fresh data on consumer spending and confidence will provide clues on how high prices are shaping Americans‚Äô behavior and the extent to which the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest-rate increases are rippling through the economy. 

The volatility has been stomach-churning for many investors as they have watched their portfolios steadily decline in value week after week. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve really been taking a beating,‚Äù said Santi Tafarella, a 58-year-old community-college professor in the Lancaster, Calif., area. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm uncomfortable.‚Äù 

Mr. Tafarella said he has been buying the dip in the stock market‚Äîincluding on Friday‚Äîonly to see his positions quickly sour. 

Other investors said they are hanging on and haven‚Äôt yet backed away from buying the dip, trying to keep a steady hand and an eye on long-term returns. At least one trend has persevered: Individual investors have tended to buy more shares of U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds on days when the S&amp;P 500 is down than when it is rising, according to Vanda Research. 

***That includes Sept. 13, when the S&amp;P 500 tumbled 4.3% in its sharpest one-day fall since 2020. Individual investors bought more than $2 billion of U.S. shares and exchange-traded funds that day, the second-highest total of the year.*** They bought $395 million of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust alone that day, the highest one-day amount of 2022. 

U.S. households have poured more money into U.S. equity mutual funds and ETFs than they have pulled out for the year. U.S. funds have drawn $89 billion of net inflows in 2022, according to EPFR Global data analyzed by Goldman Sachs. That is in contrast to many institutional investors who have yanked money from the market. 

Yet much of the euphoria that dominated markets in 2020 has evaporated. A basket of popular stocks among individual investors that includes Tesla Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and chip makers such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Nvidia Corp. has fallen 30% this year, underperforming the broader market. ***Technology stocks are particularly sensitive to rising rates, leading to especially steep losses.*** 

Meanwhile, intraday trading among individuals, as defined by daily dollar volume, has dropped to levels not seen since January 2020, before the pandemic, according to Vanda Research analysts. Individual traders‚Äô activity in bullish call options, popular bets to profit from a surge in stocks, has tumbled to some of the lowest levels of the past two years, according to Deutsche Bank data.

***‚ÄúThe frenzied, frothy behavior isn‚Äôt there,‚Äù said Lule Demmissie, U.S. chief executive of the brokerage eToro. ‚ÄúBut that long-term thesis of investing for the long term is.‚Äù***

Some of the momentum-driven trades that flourished over the past two years have caused big losses for investors. Attempting to buy the dip in Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARK Innovation ETF, for example, has been particularly painful. 

On Wednesday, shares of the fund jumped as much as 3.2% as traders piled in, hoping to ride a rebound after a continued selloff that has now dragged it down 60% this year. Instead, the fund ended the day down by roughly the same amount after the Fed‚Äôs interest-rate decision led many traders to rapidly change their forecasts for how aggressive the central bank would be in raising rates through next year. The rate increase stoked a sharp selloff across the market. 

The ARK ETF drew $197 million of inflows Wednesday, the most for a single day since July, according to FactSet. The fund resumed its slide Thursday, falling 4.3% and heading toward a double-digit decline for the week. 

Caleb Adams, an 18-year-old university student who said he started investing a few years ago through a custodial account, a type of investment account for minors, said the ARK fund has been one of his biggest losers. 

‚ÄúI fell into the trap of the high-growth, highflying companies and invested money into her ETFs, and they have not done very well,‚Äù he said. 

Still, Mr. Adams, who started investing by buying into Tesla shares, said he has tried to continue stashing away money in his brokerage account regularly. Cash he received for his high-school graduation helped him increase his exposure to the market, as did money he earned doing odd jobs for his parents, such as organizing business contacts electronically for his mom. 

Mr. Tafarella said his approach has changed dramatically since the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when he tried his hand at day trading with little success. He was hoping to make enough money to help pay for his daughters‚Äô college education and shield his family from the burden of student loans. 

‚ÄúI started off feeling very greedy,‚Äù Mr. Tafarella said. ‚ÄúI thought, I can probably turn this into $100K within a year.‚Äù

Since then, he has shifted to a basket of diversified ETFs into which he has steadily poured money. 

One factor that is shifting the calculus for some investors: Ultrasafe government debt is suddenly looking attractive. High inflation and the Fed‚Äôs rate increases have stoked a sharp selloff in the bond market, sending yields to the highest levels of the past decade.

Claire de Weerdt, a 34-year-old consultant and business owner based near Vancouver, British Columbia, said she bought a fund overseeing stocks and bonds earlier in the year to diversify her holdings, though the fund has fallen in value along with the broader market. She has also parked some cash in a fixed-income investment for her business and has sought to build a bigger cash buffer in case of a recession. Still, she said she has no plans to sell her stocks.  

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôd be silly to sell stocks,‚Äù Ms. de Weerdt said. ***‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what the markets are like in one or two years. I care what they‚Äôre like in 30 years.‚Äù***

I want to contrast this article with one posted earlier this year:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ummmp3/buy_the_dip_believers_are_tested_by_markets/

&gt;&gt;Individuals‚Äô willingness to backstop markets throughout this year‚Äôs selloff demonstrates that the group‚Äîfor now‚Äîhas been more resilient than analysts and trading professionals anticipated. Few were surprised when individual investors pounced on small dips as the market churned higher last year, helping the S&amp;P 500 cruise to 70 records and rewarding those who waded in.

This current article points to likely further capitulation by the retail investor.

Also, the CAPE is currently still at 27.  CAPE is simply the way Ben Graham uses PE ratios in the value school of investing, CAPE being an aggregate measure.  The inverse of CAPE gives you aggregate rate of return of the stock market...at 25, aggregate rate of return is 4%.  Long term average rate of return of the stock market is around 7-10%, i.e. 4% ROR is unsustainable unless you believe the stock market should return (far) less than 7%.  What this means is that in order to attain a healthy valuation of the stock market, its rate of return will need to increase, i.e. CAPE will have to decrease.  At CAPE 15, you get the 7% rate of return.  During the 70s, the last time we had persistent inflation, CAPE fell below 10.

Canadian stock ready to explode?,I have been watching a stock lately called Revive Therapeutics. Says they have submitted for endpoint change and are pretty much done with phase 3 clinical trials for a covid treatment with a repurposed drug pill called bucillamine. Being so close to such a big accomplishment I would think the stock would be rallying but it trades sideways mostly. Was wondering if anyone else was looking at it or had some thoughts?

I love coke meaning,"So. Now with a little touch of hindsight we can look at this with the proper lens. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/w564jr/rc_loves_coke_and_coke_loves_bbby_freeman_capital/

dont think RC in hindsight ""loved"" freeman capital and instead was WARNING US. 

What does this all mean?

The FCM BBBY pump and dump, followed by the MNMD pump and dump, was possibly a group effort by the MSM, the Brokers and the SEC to pump up this stock and make a boatload of money.

This is market manipulation and my guess is‚Ä¶ Jake Freeman was used as a mule to cover the truth. This is most likely insider trading. The institutions know that the new cycles start(ed) and did this to profit off BBBY. They invested $25m and made over $100m front running their own algo.

They then painted a story that he dumped it to cause price anchoring and deter new investors from buying BBBY.

The whole thing reeks of fraud and crime, insider trading and market manipulation with influence from the MSM, Brokers and the SEC.

My theory: Freeman (the older ones) own a TON of bbby bonds and are set to lose millions if BBBY doesn't die. The BBBY pump (and use of their nephew, enjoy prison fucker) was just their hedge and there's a reason why Jakey boy hasn't even touched that 110m... it's cause it isn't his. It's his uncles and daddies / cokes money :)

This purchase also pushed Ryan Cohen over the 10% ownership so I think it was a tactic combined with the rising share cost pressured him to sell. 14 days after the FCM 5m shares became public knowledge RC tweets out I love coke. In hindsight I think we know why 

What‚Äôs Jake doing now? 

Getting bag holders Ofc. 

Now with jakes attention for being a ‚Äúmeme trader‚Äù aka insider trader, he‚Äôs using his low amount of clout he has to continue to pump MNMD to redditors on another sub that I won‚Äôt name to avoid brigading. These poor bastards keep going ‚Äúwell he made 100m in bbby he must know what he‚Äôs doing‚Äù or ‚Äúuse that money jake!‚Äù When he probably can‚Äôt lol. Just like his days on the BBBY sub he‚Äôs acting like he‚Äôs talking with the board for the interest of retail when really him and his family are just looking for a good exit. I honestly think he should be perm banned. He hyped up all week an announcement and all he did was release ‚Äústellar memes‚Äù (his words) trying to get Reddit to make MNMD a meme stock, which btw his uncle co founded.",BBBY,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/xnzi17/i_love_coke_meaning/,üó£ Discussion / Question,FCMhatescokes,xnzi17,/r/BBBY/comments/xnzi17/i_love_coke_meaning/,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/xnzi17,1,2022-09-25
"Discussion on the often used phrase: ""Diversification preserves wealth; concentration builds it.""","I broadly interpret this as an ETF vs individual stock comparison despite, to some extent, being able to concentrate via ETFs as well as diversity via sector spreading individual stocks, and what have you.   I'm also sure we're all aware that concentration can lose one's wealth just as quickly as building it.  

Question: Concerning diversification, do you feel that the more you have the better?  Or is it like salt in that you just need ""enough"" and you experience diminishing returns once you have ""enough""

Secondary question: Would a 50 year old with nothing yet saved for retirement, in essence, be ""forced"" to concentrate if he wanted to retire in his early 60s given he had, say, $1500 a month to put into the market?  Let's assume a relatively average lifestyle with no extreme circumstances that would require him to need more or less for a reasonable retirement.  Let's also assume he's single with no spouse contributing toward retirement and no debt... again, would this theoretical person have no choice but to concentrate his portfolio to have any chance of catching up?

Anyway, the thoughts above have been bouncing around in my head recently and I'm curious and would appreciate any all thought pertaining to any or all of the above, as well as anything you judge to be relevant.

Is anyone concerned with management?,"I'm a holder of Opendoor LT. As a long term investor, are you concerned with the lack of dialogue from management? Especially from Eric Wu? Even on investor calls, it sounds like he's reading from a script. 

Is anyone concerned with the lack of stock brought by the C-level execs? I'd like to think they'd gawk over buying shares at $3 and $4, similar to Anthony Noto at SoFi. 

Going public, issuing 630M common shares (more than Zillow, Redfin, and Offerpad combined), and accruing $540M of stock-based comp, and Eric Wu's $34M home purchase right before the market turns? One would have to think these are all connected. 

Sure, the nature of this real estate market turn has probably the most unprecedented in the past X years - but even then, still feels like some purchase prices, at least here in Atlanta and what I've seen of Phoenix, have been unwarranted - almost as if there's a lack of expertise/leadership locally (which I'd imagine shouldn't be the case). I've driven by OD homes here in Atlanta, looked up the home price, and just know that some aren't going to sell unless there's another $30-$40k reduction at minimum - on top of what it may have already been reduced by.

I feel like these are extremely basic questions that are barely being dissected outside of a comment here or there.  I still believe the business in theory should be able to weather this storm and that iBuying will become a natural way to shop/sell real estate. Just feel like management should be doing way more to build trust with it's shareholders. I get the flipside as well...the less management says the less chance of a PR nightmare, but man, seems like that strategy may be backfiring.

So how exactly do I buy one of these trucks?,"I think the maverick is really cool. I want to downsize from my Tacoma.

I‚Äôve never bought a new car before, and obviously the Maverick hasn‚Äôt been out long enough to have a used market yet. How exactly do I get my hands on one of these little trucks?

None of the Ford dealers in my area have any of these in stock. Nobody is selling these things used anywhere. There‚Äôs one dealer some hours north of me which has a single AWD version (I live in WA so I do need the AWD), but they‚Äôre asking around $45k for it. At that price I could get a way nicer TRD Tacoma brand new‚Ä¶

Do I have to submit a custom order and wait to get it? I don‚Äôt have a problem with waiting but I really wish I could find one on lot so I could at least test drive before spending that kind of money.

Some other folks seem to take a much larger allocation for international stocks, but I'm not sure how much is an over-allocation.

I love coke meaning,"I love coke meaning

So. Now with a little touch of hindsight we can look at this with the proper lens. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/w564jr/rc_loves_coke_and_coke_loves_bbby_freeman_capital/

dont think RC in hindsight ""loved"" freeman capital and instead was WARNING US. 

What does this all mean?

The FCM BBBY pump and dump, followed by the MNMD pump and dump, was possibly a group effort by the MSM, the Brokers and the SEC to pump up this stock and make a boatload of money.

This is market manipulation and my guess is‚Ä¶ Jake Freeman was used as a mule to cover the truth. This is most likely insider trading. The institutions know that the new cycles start(ed) and did this to profit off BBBY. They invested $25m and made over $100m front running their own algo.

They then painted a story that he dumped it to cause price anchoring and deter new investors from buying BBBY.

The whole thing reeks of fraud and crime, insider trading and market manipulation with influence from the MSM, Brokers and the SEC.

My theory: Freeman (the older ones) own a TON of bbby bonds and are set to lose millions if BBBY doesn't die. The BBBY pump (and use of their nephew, enjoy prison fucker) was just their hedge and there's a reason why Jakey boy hasn't even touched that 110m... it's cause it isn't his. It's his uncles and daddies / cokes money :)

This purchase also pushed Ryan Cohen over the 10% ownership so I think it was a tactic combined with the rising share cost pressured him to sell. 14 days after the FCM 5m shares became public knowledge RC tweets out I love coke. In hindsight I think we know why 

What‚Äôs Jake doing now? 

Getting bag holders Ofc. 

Now with jakes attention for being a ‚Äúmeme trader‚Äù aka insider trader, he‚Äôs using his low amount of clout he has to continue to pump MNMD to redditors on another sub that I won‚Äôt name to avoid brigading. These poor bastards keep going ‚Äúwell he made 100m in bbby he must know what he‚Äôs doing‚Äù or ‚Äúuse that money jake!‚Äù When he probably can‚Äôt lol. Just like his days on the BBBY sub he‚Äôs acting like he‚Äôs talking with the board for the interest of retail when really him and his family are just looking for a good exit. I honestly think he should be perm banned. He hyped up all week an announcement and all he did was release ‚Äústellar memes‚Äù (his words) trying to get Reddit to make MNMD a meme stock, which btw his uncle co founded.",freemanthefraud,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/freemanthefraud/comments/xo3gou/i_love_coke_meaning/,,FCMhatescokes,xo3gou,/r/freemanthefraud/comments/xo3gou/i_love_coke_meaning/,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/xo3gou,0,2022-09-26

The Markets This Week 9-25-2022,"(The following was written a few days ago and the Fed did raise those rates as predicted but the market did not react positively or enthusiastically.)


The stock market has seen some of the worst sessions in recent memory and the Fed concludes its policy meeting on September 21st.¬† Most sources are saying they expect the Fed to enforce another rate hike to try and curb inflation.¬† This will be the fourth rate hike to fight inflation since the beginning of 2022 if it‚Äôs enacted.¬† The markets have seen sell-offs every day and at this point the future is unclear.¬† Technology stocks have been hit hard but the whole market is down.¬† This upcoming policy meeting will determine what course of action to take regarding the economy.¬† I have seen positive market response before when these rate hikes went into effect but I am not a financial expert or advisor.¬† These are my opinions.¬†¬†

It's worth noting that, yes, the impression\_score\[0\] is lower than BBBY and that there are more pressing things to discuss (upcoming nuclear apocalypse for one) which will reduce total amount of positive stock mentions.

However, I think it's interesting to note that a stock with such a small market cap is leading discussions. Your dollar has more of an effect on it than it did on BBBY or GME.

This is not a suggestion to buy, this is a suggestion to keep an eye on it to find a good price to get in. Small cap means volatile. Price based on public opinion means volatile. Upcoming recession and war means volatile.

"I have a theory that when Archegos blew up they were long on GME, that they battled with Citadel on March 10th 2021, lost and were consequently destroyed by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and the rest of the DTCC with them crashing the price of their long positions","This is very tinfoil, but we love that shit right? The **TLDR is in the title**, the rest of the post is just all my circumstantial evidence backing it up. None of this is concrete because Archegos famously didn't ever report their positions and dealt mainly in swap positions which don't have to be reported so take all of this with a pinch of salt, but please be open minded.

**/u/Blanderson_Snooper** is one of the best DD writers we have on this sub and they put together this [**Archegos Fact Sheet**](https://reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vhnc86/archegos_fact_sheet_what_we_know_and_how_it/) 3 months ago which goes into great detail about the situation if you have a chance to go through it. There have been tons of posts on Archegos and **I love each ape digging into all of this** because I know how time consuming it is.

***
***

#The basics of the Archegos situation

Most of you will probably know the basics of the Archegos situation by now but for any new apes here's a brief summary:

- It was run by Bill Hwang who was one of the shadiest fuckers to have ever traded. He's been fined by the SEC for insider trading, banned from trading in Hong Kong and was blacklisted by Goldman Sachs until some time around 2018.

- Archegos went from having $1.5 billion in value in March 2020 to $36 billion in value in March 2021 (when it went under). That's a 2400% return in one year, which is unheard of unless you use a lot of crime. 

- They mainly operated using swaps ($132 billion out of $160 billion of exposure was due to various swap positions)

- They used multiple different counterparties for these swaps including Credit Suisse, Nomura, UBS, Morgan Stanley, Mitsubishi UFJ Group, Mizuho, Deutsche, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. Apparently Archegos kept each of their counter parties in the dark about the positions held with their other counter parties and lied constantly about the level exposure they had.

- Starting on March 23 2021, Archegos' long positions began losing value; Archegos went from being worth $36.2 billion on March 22 to $9.2 billion on March 25. This triggered a lot of margin calls and consequently Archegos' counterparties liquidated their positions to cover these losses. This was the end for Archegos as all remaining value was wiped out.

- Archegos' counterparties collectively lost over $10 billion from all of this, breakdown shown [**here**](https://i.imgur.com/n4V4B32.png)

***
***

#My theory

Archegos and the people who ran it have been slated for their downfall saying they took excessive risks using too much margin and set themselves up to fail. An article came out called *""The Dumbest Financial Story of 2021 - Everyone involved in the swift fall of Archegos Capital Management should be embarrassed""*.

**But here's my thesis:** Archegos wasn't destroyed due to their own incompetence, their long positions were maliciously attacked by the DTCC because Archegos went long on GME and had been trying to fuck up Shitadel's shorting mess with Gamestop.

One thing I want to cover before we look into Archegos in detail is **what the DTCC actually is**.

***
***

#The DTCC Mafia

The DTCC was designed to provide clearing services for the US markets, making sure money gets from buyers to sellers and stocks and other assets get from sellers to buyers. But **the DTCC isn't a government organization**, it's made up of 235 individual US companies and the board is made up of 22 individuals who work for companies like Citadel, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Virtu, Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas etc. You can find the full DTCC members list [**on this directory**](https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/dtc-directories).

The DTCC has [**sets of rules**](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/rules-and-procedures) their members have to follow to be a member, and one important bit for us is [**this bit**](https://i.imgur.com/84xkMFR.png). This basically means that if any DTCC member has an ""Event Period"" which is a Default Loss Event then all the other members of the DTCC have to cover the losses of the defaulting member. So for example, if Citadel (a DTCC member) created hundreds of millions or even billions of extra GME shares that shouldn't exist and those shares go up in value causing Citadel to be margin called beyond their means, then all of the other 234 DTCC members (including all the major banks) have to cover the cost of buying back all of Citadel's naked shorts. Remember **shorting has potentially unlimited loss**.

So the fuckups of one DTCC member are carried by all members, and that means I don't even see companies like Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citadel, Virtu, Robinhood or any DTCC member as separate entities anymore. To me they all make up the single corrupt entity known as the DTCC, who will happily commit international securities fraud to buy themselves one extra day of survival.

Citadel might be the main market maker churning out fake GME tokens everyday, but it's in all of the DTCC member's interests that Citadel doesn't get margin called. It's a fucking mafia, they'll put anyone in the ground that tries to fuck with them, which in my opinion is exactly what they all did to Archegos.

I hope you're ready to come down a pretty fucked up rabbit hole with me.

#What SPECIFICALLY caused Archegos blow up?

The SEC complaint against Archegos shows that [**these**](https://imgur.com/a/rIFDuJn) were their largest positions (The ones with ADR are Chinese companies traded on US exchanges). Multiple sources say that these positions are what caused Archegos to get margin called when they all started losing value on March 23. On March 26 Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (aka The DTCC) started liquidating Archegos' remaining positions, but that liquidation isn't what caused them to all dramatically lose value, they all spontaneously lost about 30% of value which caused the margin calls.

I'm going to look at 6 of Archegos' largest positions: VIAC, BIDU, TME, GSX, VIPS &amp; DISCA. If we look at a long term view of these 6 stocks [**it looks like this**](https://i.imgur.com/8CndJab.png) and they all show the same trend; they all get inflated in price at the start of 2021 and then have a dramatic drop in March 2021. These almost look like short squeezes, but we know now that Archegos was artificially inflating the prices of these stocks. Let's take a closer look at those drops and how similar they all look.

This is how all of those 6 stocks looked from March 15 to March 30 2021 (excuse my shitty MS Paint skills):

Hwang on a minute, so these 6 unrelated stocks all saw at least a 26.3% price drop and a day where at least 21% of total outstanding shares got traded? Those are GME levels of fuckery.

#Articles explaining the price drops

I'm now gonna utilize my epic google skills to find any publicly available reasons those companies dropped in price between March 22 - March 25.

- **VIAC** and **DISCA** are covered by this [**Motley Fool article**](https://web.archive.org/web/20220421145109/https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/26/why-discovery-communications-stock-plunged-today/):

&gt; Trading volume on Discovery stock was extraordinarily high today, approaching 50 million shares before 2 p.m. EDT. This indicates that an institutional investor may have decided to sell some of its stake in the media company.

&gt; **ViacomCBS shares fell, in part because of a downgrade from Wells Fargo**

They're putting a 32% drop in **VIAC**'s price partially down to Wells Fargo (a DTCC member) downgrading their rating of the stock.

&gt; As the chart below shows, Discovery has moved almost perfectly in tandem with ViacomCBS as excitement about the companies' new streaming services fueled a bullish narrative. However, those gains are quickly disappearing as **investors seem to realize that streaming services alone don't justify a tripling of the share price in just a few months.**

Try and get your head around that statement; investors in the stock **DISCA** realized their investment was overpriced so they decided to sell en masse? What? *""Let's just all shoot ourselves in the foot and burn some of our assets""* because that makes perfect sense. Just utter bullshit like we see with GME, I'm honestly surprised they didn't say DISCA fell in sympathy with VIAC.

[**One more article on VIAC**](https://web.archive.org/web/20220324075044/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/26/business/media/viacomcbs-stock-price-viac.html) mentions another low stock rating by ""one of Wall Street‚Äôs most influential research firms"", MoffettNathanson, and goes into a stock offering VIAC had just announced.

&gt; Mar. 24, 2021-- ViacomCBS Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAC, VIACA) today announced the pricing of concurrent offerings (the ‚ÄúOfferings‚Äù) of 20,000,000 shares of its Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share (‚ÄúClass B common stock‚Äù), at a price to the public of $85.00 per share

So here's something I didn't know about stock offerings, the company's underwriters decide what price the new stock goes on sale for and in this case the stock went onto the market 14.3% cheaper than its previously traded price. Let's take a look at who VIAC's underwriters are [**here**](https://i.imgur.com/N2FA24u.png). Other than a few smaller firms that's a majority of big DTCC companies. The article above shows that VIAC dipped slightly because the stock offering price suggested it was overvalued, so the DTCC helped cause this dip.

- **BIDU** and **TME** are covered by this [**Motley Fool article released March 25 2021**](https://web.archive.org/web/20220915015245/https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/25/why-baidu-stock-fell-today/) says:

&gt; Shares of Baidu Inc. plummeted today as investors feared that the China-based tech giant may receive increased oversight from Chinese regulators, in addition to threats from the U.S. about potential delistings of foreign stocks. The tech stock fell by 13.4% today.

And this [**BBC article**](https://web.archive.org/web/20220720121521/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56410769) says:

&gt; China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) on Friday said it had fined 12 companies over 10 deals that violated anti-monopoly rules. The companies included Tencent, Baidu, Didi Chuxing, SoftBank and a ByteDance-backed firm, the SAMR said in a statement. Investors appear to be worried that Tencent could be the next company in the crosshairs of China's regulators, who have taken an increasing interest in how major tech companies operate.

Alright, increased regulation on a stock is bearish but is it enough to warrant a 30% drop in price? I'll let you decide that one.

- **VIPS** and **GSX** are covered in [**this CNBC article**](https://web.archive.org/web/20210728044800/https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/china-listed-stocks-tank-on-fears-of-multiple-disputes-with-us.html) which again goes onto additional regulations on Chinese listed stocks. Bear in mind that these are only potential worries at this point and yet it was enough to drop VIPS 33.7% and GSX 29.5% in 4 days. Over-reaction much?

#Summary

These 6 stocks fell considerably either because they were downgraded by the DTCC, were affected by fears of further regulation for Chinese stocks or everyone just decided to sell at the same time. I'm smelling a lot of BS. All 6 stocks moved in the same pattern, had days of ridiculously high volume and all did so by March 26 where they'd lost considerable value. I'm just gonna say this bluntly: I believe these 6 stocks were shorted to hell during these 4 days just like we've seen with GME.

#March 26 Margin Calls

[**This article**](https://web.archive.org/web/20220901203344/https://slate.com/business/2021/03/archegos-capital-management-dumbest-financial-story-2021.html) mentions Archegos' margin calls:

&gt; When someone trades on margin‚Äîwith borrowed money‚Äîthey may have to maintain a certain amount of collateral to satisfy their lenders. If the value of a stock holding goes down, the investor needs more collateral. Not having it triggers a margin call, where the lender can force a sell-off of the stock to bring the investor back into compliance with margin requirements. The Wall Street Journal reported that Archegos‚Äô various banks‚Äîincluding Credit Suisse, Nomura, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley‚Äîhad a meeting to discuss how to effectively wind down the family office‚Äôs positions. **But the two American banks appear to have had little interest in acting slowly. Goldman and Morgan Stanley limited their losses by selling Archegos‚Äô shares quickly**, before the size of the sale brought on a larger fall in the stocks‚Äô prices.

Does anyone else find it interesting that Goldman &amp; MS didn't want to wait and talk this out with the other banks or with Archegos? They went straight in with the kill and began liquidating Archegos' positions on March 26. Yes their reasoning was fine, that they didn't want to lose more money from Archegos' falling stocks, but as you saw in the previous section I believe these central DTCC banks could have been partially responsible for the drop in those stocks in the first place.

If you're not a DTCC member and the DTCC margin calls you it'll happen faster than it should happen, which is a bit different from what happens [**when you're a DTCC member and get margin called by the DTCC**](https://i.imgur.com/NH3fIGb.png). Remember the DTCC waived $9.7B spread out among 6 firms on Jan 28, 2021 ([**exposed on PG.101 Maxine's Report**](https://i.imgur.com/SAySuOT.png)), Robinhood's waiver was $2.2B of the $9.7B.

So why would 2 DTCC banks who were members of the board want to destroy Archegos? Let's go deeper down the rabbit hole.

#March 10 2021

For many apes this will be remembered as one of the craziest days of the whole GME saga. GME dropped from $340 to $180 in a flash crash, there were allegations of MarketWatch releasing news of a price drop before it happened and strangest of all [**this battle took place between 2 high frequency trading algorithms**](https://i.imgur.com/gfSO618.jpg) (sorry for the blurry pic, I don't have a clearer one). That bar coding constantly changing the price from $240 to $340 is not fucking normal, stock prices aren't supposed to move that dramatically in single minute bars like that. Clearly 2 very powerful companies had a disagreement on where the price should be, I think we all know Citadel &amp; their pals at the DTCC were the shorts and I believe now that Archegos was the ""good whale"" who tried to keep the price up at $340.

March 10 was a significant day for GME shorts because [**March 11**](https://i.imgur.com/sd7CYjh.png) was the roll date for swaps. Whatever price securities closed at on March 10 would determine how much SHFs would have to pay to keep their swap positions open, and considering Jan 21 saw 1 billion more GME shares traded than normal (pre split), that's a lot of swaps they had to roll. If the price closed at $340 on March 10 instead of the $265 it did close at then it could have cost Citadel hundreds of billions more to roll the swaps.

Do I have any evidence that was Archegos? Nope, none at all, but I find it oddly fitting that just 2 weeks later DTCC members seemed to collude to put Archegos into the ground on March 26.

[**This comment screenshot**](https://i.redd.it/jzz8fzxp3xp91.jpg) goes into how lawyers were present on all calls between Archegos' brokers and everyone was told not to disclose Archegos' positions. Maybe that's standard procedure or maybe it was extra protection to hide the fact they had been involved with GME? News of Archegos' demise made the main shill news outlets within days of their blow up and the only thing blamed were those 8 largest positions linked before, but as Blanderson_Snooper pointed out their total exposure was like this:

- $86 billion in long TRS positions referencing single securities

- $32 billion in custom basket swaps

- $14 billion in ETF swaps

- $20 billion in long cash securities

- $8 billion in short swaps referencing single securities

It was all clearly more than just 8 positions, and yet MSM shills controlled the narrative to make it just about those 8. And yes that was what caused the margin calls, but it seems like great effort was made to not release *all* of the positions. I would bet $1 million (aka 0.01 of a GME share) that Archegos was long on GME by the time they went under.

Archegos did apparently lose $800M on Jan 28 and Blanderson_snooper said that might suggest they were short on meme stocks, but the SP500 took a battering that day (likely Ken liquidating long positions to pay for GME naked shorting) so even if you were long on a lot of blue chip stocks you would have been burned. It was said that Archegos was long on some index swaps like the SP500, so this could still add up.

I think Hwang would have known what was going on during the Jan sneeze, that Citadel was printing hundreds of millions of GME shares to give to Melvin &amp; other SHFs so they could close their shorts and in doing so Citadel took on the short positions which they shoved into swaps. Hwang played with all these same instruments and would have seen the insane activity in ETFs containing GME and all the DOOMPs and other derivatives used to pull GME shares out of think air. I think he could have seen an opportunity during Feb 21 when the price was low again to go long on GME and make a fortune squeezing Citadel. If so, he took the gamble and lost and was burned to ashes. I hope this is all true and he comes out and says it one day, because that would irrefutably prove Citadel &amp; the DTCC are guilty of exactly what Bill Hwang is on trial for now.

#Fallout

Bill Hwang was arrested this year and is facing up to 380 years in prison, but in my opinion this isn't only justice being served, it's a warning from the DTCC for everyone else to stay in line. Trillions of dollars were lost in 2008 from agencies rigging mortgage ratings and no one was blamed, and yet Hwang cost a small number of banks $10B and he's made out to be the worst villain ever? It's like DFV said about Gamestop, *""The negative sentiment is just too high""*. But if this is a message to tell others not to go long on GME using dirty swap plays, then I understand them going so hard on Hwang.

And to me that's why RC is playing 5D chess doing this slow and steady without directly provoking the mafia. Citadel is destroying themselves by delaying this each day. Whether it's DRS that finally triggers the MOASS or an epic market crash, MOASS is inevitable however you look at it. Swaps hide the crime but don't make institutions immune to standard market movements like we saw with Archegos. So there's no way out for Ken. Is he going to suppress Gamestop for another decade? What if they eventually get to $100b profit in a quarter, will BoA up their price target from $20 to $25? It's over mayoman and we all want to see you go down for 380 years too.

Let me know your thoughts on Archegos being long GME, I know it's tinfoil but if there are other places to try and back up the theory I'll definitely do more digging.

"SEP 26, 2022 TLO.TO US EV BATTERY SUPPLY CHAIN: TALON AND FLEET SPACE TO PILOT SATELLITE-ENABLED MINERAL EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE U.S.","https://preview.redd.it/45cmk228d8q91.png?width=3500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90c6aa92bb1b3b1500fef0f8083e7e71674118ce

Fleet's new ""earth scanning"" technology can increase drilling accuracy and decrease land disturbance in exploration for high-grade nickel deposits vital to the U.S. energy transition

Tamarack, Minnesota--(Newsfile Corp. - September 26, 2022) - Talon Metals Corp. (TSX: TLO) (OTC Pink: TLOFF)¬†(""**Talon**"" or the ""**Company**"") and Fleet Space Technologies (""**Fleet**"") have agreed to pilot Fleet's ExoSphere rapid mineral exploration solution at Talon's exploration projects in Minnesota and Michigan. Talon is exploring for high-grade nickel deposits in the United States to supply the domestic battery supply chain with nickel and other battery materials required in the energy transition.

*""We are excited to work with Fleet to pilot their impressive advanced seismic tomography approach to mineral discovery and pair it with our in-house exploration teams' unique approach to finding more high-grade nickel in the United States,""* said Henri von Rooyen, CEO of Talon. He continued *""Fleet's technology has the potential to deliver two tantalizing results for geologists like our team of proven ""nickel hunters"": speed and accuracy. Increased accuracy means less disturbance of the earth as compared to conventional exploration practices. Speed means a faster path to discovering the metallic minerals like nickel that society needs for the energy transition.""*

Fleet's ExoSphere technology scans the ground using an advanced seismic tomography technique, called Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT), where highly transportable 'Geode' devices listen to faint background vibrations from natural and man-made sources. The data is then processed rapidly and transmitted from anywhere in the world through Fleet's constellation of low earth orbit satellites, recently launched by SpaceX.

*""Our satellite enabled earth sub-scanning technology will play a vital role in securing the U.S. mineral supply chain quickly, sustainably and less expensively. Fleet is excited to be working with Talon to pilot our ground-breaking exploration technology in North America,"" said Matt Pearson, Chief Exploration Officer &amp; Co-Founder, Fleet Space Technologies. ""With Fleet's ExoSphere technology, we are able to easily scan the earth in 3D, faster and with less environmental impact than ever before possible. This cleaner, faster and more flexible approach to exploration answers the urgent global need* *to* *find the minerals and metals required in the energy transition. ExoSphere is supporting the world's transition to more sustainable practices by speeding up vital mineral discoveries more than one hundred-fold.""*

About Fleet's ExoSphere Technology:

* Fleet's rapid exploration solution (ExoSphere) enhances drill program accuracy by scanning a target area with advanced, low-impact ground sensors (Geodes) connected through Fleet's low-power satellite network.
* Fleet's Geodes are up to 10x more sensitive than existing nodal geophones, which increases accuracy and depth of results.
* Fleet's Geodes are hand transportable by small teams at surface, are battery powered and can be moved as data is received and new targets are identified.
* Each wireless, battery-operated Geode contains a sophisticated processing unit, satellite transmitter and seismic sensor. The Geodes use the principles of seismology to map the properties of the Earth's subsurface from faint background seismic waves - a process known as Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT).
* Once sufficient ANT data is gathered, Geodes partially process the raw information on site, reducing the data requirement for transmission.
* The data from each Geode is rapidly processed and can deliver a full 3D visualisation of the subsurface down to 2 km depth. A clear, rich image of what resources may be below ground can be generated in as little as four days.
* Using a bespoke Fleet-developed system, these visualisations are accessible to view and export anywhere on earth in near real-time. The speed of this imaging now means that thousands of square kilometres of area can be imaged in a fraction of the time of traditional ground-based methods that would currently require drilling rigs to be moved into place.

The data collected from the in-field Geodes is securely pushed to Fleet's network of low-power small satellites. The satellites then send the data to ground stations to process data using Fleet's proprietary processing systems delivering a 3D visualisation of the area to support critical exploration decisions. This in turn allows teams of geologists like Talon's team of in-house ""nickel hunters"" to make informed decisions on areas of interest much faster than traditional methods.

Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Discount Widens to Record High,"The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, the world‚Äôs largest bitcoin fund, **saw its discount widen to a record high last week.**

The $12 billion trust, known by its ticker symbol GBTC, **was trading at a 35.18% discount to its underlying bitcoin holdings on Friday**, according to YCharts. Bitcoin was trading at $18,852 at 5 p.m. Friday, its lowest level since June 30, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

As the first‚Äìand for many years only‚ÄìSEC-approved investment vehicle for retail investors to access bitcoin, GBTC‚Äôs share price historically traded at a premium to the bitcoin it held. In February 2021, the GBTC premium turned into a discount as several physically backed bitcoin exchange-traded funds came to market in Canada.

In June, the SEC rejected Grayscale‚Äôs bid to transform GBTC into an ETF. The company sued the SEC; the legal battle is ongoing.

Grayscale has said converting GBTC into an ETF will likely help bring its share price to trade in line with its underlying value. The company didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment.

Thoughts on $RVPH?,"found this post:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/i9v7pu/50x_profit_spac_warrant_possibility_do_your_own_dd/

It's pretty old but most of the points are still valid imo. So I did some research on the stock which leads to my question: what makes its value so low (market cap around $40m) Is there anything obvious to biotech investors that makes it uninvestable? Why is the difference in MC between $RVPH and $KRTX so huge (~200x)? Rn the company is enrolling into its p3 trial and expects results by mid 2023

According to a comment under the linked post (neuroscientist):
 ""Karuna and Reviva are only similar in diseases they focus on. The mechanism of action is novel for Karuna, much less so for Reviva. The latter takes a more traditional approach, which typically has greater negative side effects and may be a short term solution for the patient"" 
and this made him unconvinced about this company. 

But after looking through Reviva's phase 2 trial (234 participants, double blind, placebo controlled - which seems very good for a phase 2 trial which makes me feel that their p3 will most probably be positive as well) their results are very similar to Karunas and way better than normal schizophrenia drugs (both side effects and efficacy) 

Recently I saw that they secured funding at $2.53 per share and $2.40 per warrant (stock price recently fell a bit with the market to $1.78) through an offering to Vedanta (a fund associated with their chairman Parag Saxena so in my eyes that seems positive, means insiders are willing to buy the stock at that price) that gives them enough cash to last to the p3 data readout

I believe the problem could be that phase 2 was done mostly in Asia so FDA might not be that happy about approving the drug (?) but the p3 is enrolling a big chunk of patients in the USA as well, so far the first 80 (of 400 total to be enrolled) enrolled were from the USA

Also, I don't mean to say that the difference with $KRTX  should be small, it should still be big but not 200x. I know Karuna is further in trials (recently had positive p3 data readout), has way more cash on hand, is very overvalued etc. but still I believe the difference in market cap should be more like 10-50x than 200x.

Would appreciate any feedback from experienced biotech investors/scientists on this as for me it looks very strange",Biotechplays,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biotechplays/comments/xoswfe/thoughts_on_rvph/,Discussion,thesilentlurk3r,xoswfe,/r/Biotechplays/comments/xoswfe/thoughts_on_rvph/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biotechplays/comments/xoswfe/thoughts_on_rvph/,0,2022-09-26

(SWRM.CN) Swarmio Media Partners with Apelby,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g09qq0juv7q91.jpg?width=1050&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f124892403a3c876c501eab1495987f44fbf06ed

Swarmio Media (SWRM.CN), a gaming &amp; technology company that provides products and services designed to help gamers make the most out of their hobby, recently released a video explaining the future of entertainment. Moreover, the company announced several agreements through partnerships and funding to expand its operations while improving its balance sheet.

https://preview.redd.it/h9a4jz6yv7q91.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f8a46a7c057f81de6b308acfcc03705b1589211

## Company Overview

Swarmio Media (SWRM.CN) was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Vancouver, Canada. The company aims to help gamers get the most out of their technical and social hobbies. Swarmio has many programs and platforms, such as:

\-Ember: a digital hub that builds global gaming communities, providing gamers with access to competitive challenges and tournaments, exclusive gaming content, and more services;

\-Lagless: a high-performance gamer network solution for reducing latency;

To operate these solutions, the company provides several SaaS (Software as a service) products that help telecommunication companies monetize their userbase and helps gamers engage with the games they love. On September 12, Swarmio Media announced it signed a telco wholesale distribution agreement with Apelby communications to target the European, African, and Latin American markets. It is a key partnership because Latin America is the world‚Äôs fastest-growing market, while 70% of the population remains unbanked or underbanked. Meanwhile, in Africa, the population of gamers has more than doubled over the past five years, mainly due to the proliferation of smartphones, and 57% of the population still doesn‚Äôt have a bank account.

&gt;*‚ÄúENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITH APELBY COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDES ANOTHER LEG TO OUR CONTINUED GROWTH IN KEY GAMING MARKETS. WE WELCOME APELBY‚ÄôS VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR STRATEGY OF BUILDING A PREMIER GLOBAL ONLINE GAMING AND ESPORTS HUB THROUGH STRATEGIC TELECOM PARTNERSHIPS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM AS WE CONTINUE TO LAUNCH THE EMBER PLATFORM IN NEW MARKETS WORLDWIDE.‚Äù*  
Vijai Karthigesu, CEO

## Business model

Swarmio Media will enable the purchase of in-game items with telco mobile payments to up to 2 billion gamers in Asia, MENA, Africa, and Latam. From users paying for a monthly subscription ($3 to $5 per month), Swarmio will share between 20% to 50% of the revenue with telcos. The company aims to convert 25% of its users and keep 4% of paying users for an average spend of USD $10 per user per month. According to the company‚Äôs plans, it could generate $10M in monthly revenue for up to 250M users in 2022.

## Balance sheet improvements

On August 24, the company announced some moves to reduce its debt. Swarmio Media announced it received $802k in secured debt from various private lenders. The terms of the agreement specify the obligation is repayable on demand by the lenders at any time on or after the earlier of (i)¬†November 30, 2022,¬†or (ii) the date on which the company closes an equity financing with gross proceeds of at least¬†US$2,000,000. In the meantime, lenders received common share purchase warrants entitling them to acquire an aggregate of 8M shares at $0.05 per share for up to 5 years. The net proceeds will be used for¬†**short-term working capital and general corporate purposes.**

More recently, Swarmio Media announced on September 15 an initial strategic investment of USD $1M convertible not from Apebly Communications at a cap price of USD $30 market capitalization. This new financing will help the company to¬†**support the launch of Swarmio‚Äôs proprietary gaming and esports platform in new markets, including¬†Europe,¬†Africa, and LATAM. Additional investments from Apelby may follow it**. In return for the funds advanced and to be advanced, Swarmio will issue an unsecured convertible note having a 1-year term from the date of issue and bearing interest at 10% per annum.¬†[Other conditions apply to the agreement](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swarmio-media-announces-initial-strategic-110000085.html).

&gt;*‚ÄúWE VIEW THIS AS NOT JUST AN INVESTMENT BUT THE BEGINNING OF A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL PARTNERSHIP, ALLOWING APELBY AND OUR TELCO PARTNERS TO TAP INTO THE MASSIVE¬†$200 BILLION¬†GLOBAL GAMING MARKET. MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION IS ALREADY ONLINE GAMING. HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL A LOT OF GROWTH AS SMARTPHONES AND INTERNET CONNECTIVITY BECOME MORE AVAILABLE. WE‚ÄôRE GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE EXTRA VALUE TO OUR TELCO CLIENTS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS WHO LOVE GAMING.‚Äù*  
Michal Kutzendorfer, Chairman and Founder of Apelby

## Share information/Financials

The company is only valued at ¬≠\~10M, which looks incredibly low compared to the company‚Äôs market potential. The stock price was hovering above its 52-week lows of $0.04 and bounced back to a 72% increase Month-over-Month. Many technical indicate the stock is a BUY with 12 BUYS, 9 NEUTRALS, and 5 SELLS signals. The company had 110M shares outstanding, with 8.3M options (avg. price: $0.3463) and 2.5M warrants (avg. price: $0.148). Insiders own 34% of the total share structure.

Regarding financials, Swarmio Media made the right moves because, according to the company‚Äôs latest financial statement for the period ending June 30, the company had $234k in cash, $1.2M in total current assets, for $2.7M in total liabilities.

## Bottom Line

Despite Swarmio Media‚Äôs decrease in valuation, the company worked backstage to have firm foundations. The recent partnership with Apelby, combined with the company‚Äôs funding, should buoy the company‚Äôs revenue. SWRM seems to be a substantial investment for the future.",10xPennyStocks,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/10xPennyStocks/comments/xolmam/swrmcn_swarmio_media_partners_with_apelby/,DD,PhilipCMS,xolmam,/r/10xPennyStocks/comments/xolmam/swrmcn_swarmio_media_partners_with_apelby/,https://www.reddit.com/r/10xPennyStocks/comments/xolmam/swrmcn_swarmio_media_partners_with_apelby/,0,2022-09-26
What is one stock you think can turn a profit over the next 3 months? (Mine is Wayfair),"I am more than aware that we are in a bear market and that nobody can predict the future - so please do not respond I am crazy for thinking I can make a profit during a bear market. It is possible, it just is a little harder than normal times because you can't throw a dart at a board and just glide easily upward. 

During 2008 (I was in high school btw) I would have bought something ""safe"" like Walmart to make a profit and I would have if I did the swing trade correctly in 2008. 

If I had to pick one stock to buy to swing trade between now and January 2023 I would have one solid answer: Wayfair. Wayfair will do fine this holiday season because they are a good company that will help Americans furnish their apartment and homes like always. Plus, the stock does not belong at $38. It belongs well into the $45 territory. 

I am buying up 380 shares this morning and will see what happens.

HS Govtech ($HS) Awarded Huge Contract with Kentucky Government,"Software as a Service is an important industry, but a unique niche is SaaS companies dedicated to governmental contracts. HS Govtech is the first of these companies that come to mind, and I want to share a little bit about them with you all.

* Provider of web-based and mobile solutions for health and safety regulatory agencies
* SaaS provider specifically for the Canadian and American government
* Solutions include Code Enforcement, Virtual Inspections, Environmental Health, etc.

HS has had some exciting news recently, that being a large contract awarded to them by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Here are the details:

* Contract is for $9.4 million 
* Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) of will be $1,074,073 per year (plus additional variable revenue)
* Professional Services and implementation fees are $801,000
* Was chosen amongst a variety of similar companies in a lengthy process

HS is currently trading at $0.36 with a mc of $16.575 million. HS currently has the largest user base of any health and safety regulatory software in North America, proving their ability to sell themselves. In a sea of SaaS companies, this is no small feat. I feel inclined to say they are undervalued, and have the stock price they have because of the bear market we are in, not because they deserve it.

ATXI- The Perfect Squeeze Set up,"Somehow this stock has gone under the radar (for retail that is) for the past few days and now is the perfect time to get in for many reasons which could trigger a massive short squeeze.

**Intro**

Atxi is a micro cap specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of central nervous system diseases- a huge addressable market. Just a few days ago on September 22 huge news was released, but it was released in a way that it flew over most peoples heads. The company had a 15-1 reverse split which they said was to stay in compliance with nasdaqs 1$ rule. On this same day, they announced that they had received official meeting minutes from the FDA and that they would be reducing the number of authorized shares from 50,000,000 to 20,000,000 (which is now 1.33m after the split)

**Short interest**

The float on ATXI is extremely small- only 710k shares and its trading at $3.50 meaning someone could buy the entire float for roughly 2.5 million... This sub alone could buy it for 17$/person... The insider ownership is 53% which is very comforting knowing they are so heavily invested in it themselves. At the last reporting date there was over 20% short interest. The stock jumped over %320 overnight and got shorted heavily back down in 2 days and has now filled the gap back down making it the perfect time to buy. ***It is very likely that SI has increased significantly since the reporting date after dropping 68% in two days and in conjunction with the reduction of shares makes this the perfect setup for a short squeeze.*** This stock has showed in the past many times it is capable of 300%-400% gains overnight and for no reason. I can't imagine how high it could go now that it has a reason.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Boring stuff** 

The meeting was conducted on August 9, 2022, for IV Tramadol. Avenue submitted the Type A Meeting Request and related briefing documents to the FDA on June 17, 2022, and included a proposed study design to address the concerns around the safety risk of IV Tramadol in combination with other opioid analgesics for the management of moderate-to-moderately-severe pain in adults in a medically supervised healthcare setting that was discussed in detail at the previously disclosed Advisory Committee meeting on February 15, 2022 and in the Appeal Denied letter received on March 18, 2022.

At the meeting, Avenue presented a study design for a single safety clinical trial that the Company believes could address the concerns regarding risks related to opioid stacking. The FDA stated that the proposed study design appears reasonable and agreed on various study design aspects with the expectation that additional feedback would be provided to Avenue upon review of a more detailed study protocol. The Company intends to incorporate the FDA‚Äôs suggestions from the meeting minutes and submit a detailed study protocol that could form the basis for the submission of a complete response to the second Complete Response Letter for IV Tramadol.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why This is All So Bullish**

&amp;#x200B;

The most important thing is that the FDA showed interest IV Tramadol by working with the company to get the second in Upon receiving the news the stock jumped over %320 overnight. If you look at the chart just a couple weeks prior the stock jumped almost %150 overnight on new news and no significant short interest to justify a move like that. What I think happened is someone knew the September 22 news was coming ahead of time and loaded huge- I have nothing to back this up, just what I think is the most reasonable explanation as to why this happened. My point here is that moves like this are not done by retail, someone with some importance saw this coming and sees huge potential in it. If IV Tramadol gets approved the most likely scenario is a buyout since the addressable market is so big and the company is so small, I do not have any estimates for a buy out price other than very high.

THE SHORT COVER PART 2.5: My simple method for evaluating ongoing Short Interest.,"With short interest being reported and [updated](https://www.reddit.com/r/QUANTUMSCAPE_Stock/wiki/stock/) today on the wiki, I would like to share a quick measure that I have been using to get an idea of how the short positions were affected during the period. 

There are five possible outcomes each period relating short interest (SI) with the share price (SP) and the previous reporting period. 

1. The SP goes down and SI increases
2. The SP goes up and the SI decreases 
3. The SP goes down and the SI decreases
4. The SP goes up and the SI increases
5. The SP and SI are both flat

I'll group #1 &amp; #2 together first.  

The expectation of SP is for it to fall when there is more selling and for it to rise when there is more buying.  Likewise, my expectation is that when SI increases from one reporting period to the next, that the SP will go down.  When SI falls, I expect that the SP will have increased.  

So #1 &amp; #2 are what I would consider ""Expected Behaviour"". 

\#3 is the Short Sellers ideal conditions. Over the reporting period, savvy short sellers were able to cover their short position without causing the SP price to increase, or while the market was experiencing significant downward pressure.  What is good for the Short Seller is not good for he long holder/investor. 

What **is** good for the longs is #4, when there is an increase in SI simultaneously with in increase in SP.  This shows that even though there was increased pressure to sell the stock, there were more than enough investors looking to pickup all those borrowed shares. 

\#5 is essentially a push, and basically never happens, and just means you have to wait a couple more weeks for the next report. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are the perspectives I've been looking at, and categorizing, the Short Interest as of late:

* Expected Behaviour
* Good for Us
* Good for Them

FWIW, this report was Good for Us.",QUANTUMSCAPE_Stock,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QUANTUMSCAPE_Stock/comments/xovzie/the_short_cover_part_25_my_simple_method_for/,,OriginalGWATA,xovzie,/r/QUANTUMSCAPE_Stock/comments/xovzie/the_short_cover_part_25_my_simple_method_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/QUANTUMSCAPE_Stock/comments/xovzie/the_short_cover_part_25_my_simple_method_for/,0,2022-09-26
Coho Collective Kitchens ($COHO.V),"Coho Collective Kitchens ($COHO.V) is Canada‚Äôs leading ghost kitchen provider.

Coho recently announced it has expanded its service offering as it continues to strategically execute its aggressive growth plan. At the start of September, Coho opened its 7th facility in Western Canada, Coho White Rock, located in White Rock B.C. What‚Äôs unique with this expansion is it represents a brand new vertical for Coho as it provides mixed-use capabilities (it includes a dine-in and take-out option along with a shared kitchen space and ghost kitchen) within a high-traffic retail area allowing Coho to utilize locations to their full potential.

Coho has opened 2 other locations in recent months:

Naked Short Selling - The Truth Is Much Worse Than You Have Been Told,"*Written by James Stafford of OilPrice.com*

There is a massive threat to our capital markets, the free market in general, and fair dealings overall. And no, it‚Äôs not China. It‚Äôs a homegrown threat that everyone has been afraid to talk about. Until now.

Hordes of new retail investors are banding together to take on Wall Street.¬† They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders.

The battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.

It‚Äôs a global problem, but it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets, where naked short selling‚Äîthe process of selling shares you don‚Äôt own, thereby creating counterfeit or ‚Äòphantom‚Äô shares‚Äîsurvives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.

This is an egregious act against capital markets, and it‚Äôs caused billions of dollars in damage.

Make no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies.

In Canada alone, hundreds of billions of dollars have been vaporized from pension funds and regular, everyday Canadians because of this, according to Texas-based lawyer James W. Christian. Christian and his firm¬†are heavy hitters in litigation related to stock manipulation and have prosecuted over 20 cases involving naked short selling and spoofing in the last 20 years.

*‚ÄúHundreds of billions have been stolen from everyday Canadians and Americans and pension funds alike, and this has jeopardized the integrity of Canada‚Äôs capital markets and the integral process of capital creation for entrepreneurs and job creation for the economy,‚Äù*¬†Christian told Oilprice.com.

**The Dangerous Naked Short-Selling MO**

In order to \[legally\] sell a stock short, traders must first locate and secure a borrow against the shares they intend to sell. A broker who enters such a trade must have assurance that his client will make settlement.

While ‚Äúlong‚Äù sales mean the seller owns the stock, short sales can be either ""covered"" or ""naked."" A¬†*covered short*¬†means that the short seller has already ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù or has located or arranged to borrow the shares when the short sale is made.¬†Whereas, a¬†*naked short*¬†means the short seller is selling shares it doesn‚Äôt own and has made no arrangements to buy. The seller cannot cover or ‚Äúsettle‚Äù in this instance, which means they are selling ‚Äúghost‚Äù or ‚Äúphantom‚Äù shares that simply do not exist without their action.

When you have the ability to sell an unlimited number of non-existent phantom shares in a publicly-traded company, you then have the power to destroy and manipulate the share price at your own will.

And big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them.¬†These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares.

The funds behind this are hyper sophisticated and know all the rules and tricks needed to exploit the regulators to buy themselves time to cover their short positions. According to multiple accounts from traders, lawyers, and businesses who have become victims of the worst of the worst in this game, short-sellers sometimes manage to stay naked for months on end, in clear violation of even the most relaxed securities laws.

The short-sellers and funds who participate in this manipulation almost always finance undisclosed ‚Äúshort reports‚Äù which they research &amp; prepare in advance, before paying well-known short-selling groups to publish and market their reports (often without any form of disclosure) to broad audiences in order to further push the stock down artificially. There‚Äôs no doubt that these reports are intended to create maximum fear amongst retail investors and to push them to sell their shares as quickly as possible.

That is market manipulation. Plain and simple.

Their MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. After cratering the shorted company‚Äôs share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.

In addition to the foregoing madness, brokers are often complicit in these sorts of crimes through their booking of client shares as ‚Äúlong‚Äù when they are in fact ‚Äúshort‚Äù. This is where the practice moves from a regulatory gray area to conduct worthy of prison time.

Naked short selling was officially labeled illegal in the U.S. and Europe after the 2008/2009 financial crisis.

Making it illegal didn‚Äôt stop it from happening, however, because some of the more creative traders have discovered convenient gaps between paper and electronic trading systems, and they have taken advantage of those gaps to short stocks.

Still, it gets even more sinister.

According to Christian, ‚Äúglobal working groups‚Äù coordinate their attacks on specifically targeted companies in a ‚ÄúMafia-like‚Äù strategy.

Journalists are paid off, along with social media influencers and third-party research houses that are funded by what amounts to a conspiracy. Together, they collaborate to spread lies and negative narratives to destroy a stock.

At its most illegal, there is an insider-trading element that should enrage regulators. The MO is to infiltrate a company through disgruntled insiders or lawyers close to the company. These sources are used to obtain insider information that is then leaked to damage the company.

Often, these illegal transactions involve paying off ‚Äúinformants‚Äù, journalists, influencers, and ‚Äúresearchers‚Äù are difficult to trace because they are made from offshore accounts that are shut down once the deed is done.

Likewise, the ‚Äúshorts‚Äù disguised as longs can be difficult to trace when the perpetrators have direct market access to trading systems. These trades are usually undetected until the trades fail or miss settlement.¬† At that point, the account will move the position to another broker-dealer and start the process all over again.

The collusion widens when brokers and financial institutions become complicit in purposefully mislabeling ‚Äúshorts‚Äù as ‚Äúlongs‚Äù, sweeping the illegal transactions under the rug and off of regulatory radar.

‚ÄúSpoofing‚Äù and ‚Äúlayering‚Äù have also become pervasive techniques to avoid regulator attention. Spoofing, as the name suggests, involves short sellers creating fake selling pressure on their targeted stocks to drive prices lower. They accomplish this by submitting fake offerings in ‚Äúlayers‚Äù at different prices to create a mirage.

Finally, these bad actors manage to skirt the settlement system, which is supposed to ‚Äúclear‚Äù on what is called a¬†T+2 Basis. That means that any failed trades must be bought or dealt with within 3 days. In other words, if you buy on Monday (your ‚ÄúT‚Äù or transaction day), it has to be settled by Wednesday.

Unfortunately, Canadian regulators have a hard time keeping up with this system, and failed trades are often left outstanding for much longer periods than T+2. These failing trades are constantly being traded to reset the settlement clock and move the failing trade to the back of the line. The failures of a centralized system‚Ä¶

According to Christian, it can be T+12 days before a failed trade is even brought to the attention of the IIROC (the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada)‚Ä¶

**Prime Brokers and Banks are Complicit**

This is one of Wall Street‚Äôs biggest profit center and fines levied against them are merely a minor cost of doing business.

Some banks are getting rich off of these naked short sellers. The profits off this kind of lending are tantalizing, indeed. Brokers are lending stocks they don‚Äôt own for massive profit and sizable bonuses.

This layer of what many have now called a ‚Äúcriminal organization‚Äù is the toughest for regulators to deal with, regardless of the illegal nature of these activities.

Prime brokers lend cash account shares that are absolutely not allowed to be lent. They lend them to short-sellers in order to facilitate them in settling their naked shorts.

It‚Äôs not that the regulators are in the dark on this. They are, in fact, handing out fines, left and right‚Äîboth for illegal lending and for mismarking ‚Äúshorts‚Äù and ‚Äúlongs‚Äù to evade regulatory scrutiny. The problem is that these fines pale in comparison to the profits earned through these activities.

And banks in Canada in particular are basically writing the rules themselves, recently making it easier (and legal) to lend out cash account shares.

Nor do law firms have clean hands. They help short sellers bankrupt targeted companies through court proceedings, a process that eventually leads to the disappearance of evidence of naked shorts on the bank books.

‚ÄúHow much has been stolen through this fraudulent system globally is anyone‚Äôs guess,‚Äù says Christian, ‚Äúbut the number begins with a ‚ÄòT‚Äô (trillions).‚Äù

The list of fines for enabling and engaging in manipulative activity that destroys companies‚Äô stock prices may seem to carry big numbers from the retail investor‚Äôs perspective, but they are not even close to being significant enough to deter such actions:

‚Äì The SEC charged Citigroup‚Äôs principal U.S. broker-deal subsidiary in 2011 with misleading investors about a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation (CDO) tied to the U.S. housing market. Citigroup had bet against investors as the housing market showed signs of distress. The CDO defaulted only months later, causing severe losses for investors and a profit of $160 million (just in fees and trading profits). Citigroup paid $285 million¬†to settle these SEC charges.

‚Äì In 2016, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. agreed to pay¬†$15 million¬†to settle SEC charges that its securities lending practices violated federal regulations. To wit: The SEC found that Goldman Sachs was mismarking logs and allowed customers to engage in short selling without determining whether the securities could reasonably be borrowed at settlement.

‚Äì In 2013, a Charles Schwab subsidiary was found liable by the SEC for a naked short-selling scheme and fined $8.2 million.

‚Äì The SEC charged two Merrill Lynch entities in 2015 with using ‚Äúinaccurate data in the course of executing short sale orders‚Äù, fining them $11 million.

‚Äì And most recently, Canadian Cormark Securities Inc and two others came under the SEC‚Äôs radar. On December 21, SEC instituted cease and desist orders¬†against Cormark. It also settled charges against Cormark and two other Canada-based broker deals for ‚Äúproviding incorrect order-making information that caused an executing broker‚Äôs repeated violations of Regulation SHO‚Äù. According to the SEC, Cormark and ITG Canada caused more than 200 sale orders from a single hedge fund, to the tune of more than $660 million between August 2016 and October 2017, to be mismarked as ‚Äúlong‚Äù when they were, in fact, ‚Äúshort‚Äù‚Äîa clear violation of Regulation SHO. Cormark agreed to pay a penalty of $800,000, while ITG Canada‚Äîone of the other broker-dealers charged‚Äîagreed to pay a penalty of $200,000. Charging and fining Cormark is only the tip of the iceberg. The real question is on whose behalf was Cormark making the naked short sells?

‚Äì In August 2020, Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) was fined $127 million over civil and criminal allegations in connection with its role in a massive price-manipulation scheme.

According to one Toronto-based Canadian trader who spoke to Oilprice.com on condition of anonymity,¬†*‚Äútraders are the gatekeeper for the capital markets and they‚Äôre not doing a very good job because it‚Äôs lucrative to turn a blind eye.‚Äù*¬†This game is set to end in the near future, and it is only a matter of time.

*‚ÄúThese traders are breaking a variety of regulations, and they are taking this risk on because of the size of the account,‚Äù*¬†he said.¬†*‚ÄúThey have a responsibility to turn these trades down. Whoever is doing this is breaking regulations \[for the short seller\] and they know he is not going to be able to make a settlement. As a gatekeeper, it is their regulatory responsibility to turn these trades away. Instead, they are breaking the law willfully and with full knowledge of what they are doing.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúIf you control the settlement system, you can do whatever you want,‚Äù*¬†the source said.¬†*‚ÄúThe compliance officers have no teeth because the banks are making big money. They over-lend the stocks; they lend from cash account shares to cover some of these fails ‚Ä¶ for instance, if there are 20 million shares they sold ‚Äòlong‚Äô, they can cover by borrowing from cash account shares.‚Äù*

**The Naked Truth**

In what he calls our ‚Äúominous financial reality‚Äù, Tom C.W. Lin, attorney at law, details how ‚Äúmillions of dollars can vanish in seconds, rogue actors can halt trading of billion-dollar companies, and trillion-dollar financial markets can be distorted with a simple click or a few lines of code‚Äù.

Every investor and every institution is at risk, writes Lin.

The naked truth is this: Investors stand no chance in the face of naked short sellers. It‚Äôs a game rigged in the favor of a sophisticated short cartel and Wall Street giants.

Now, with online trading making it easier to democratize trading, there are calls for regulators to make moves against these bad actors to ensure that North America‚Äôs capital markets remain protected, and retail investors are treated fairly.

The recent GameStop saga is retail fighting back against the shorting powers, and it‚Äôs a wonderful thing to see ‚Äì but is it a futile punch or the start of something bigger? The positive take away from the events the past week is that the term ‚Äúshort selling‚Äù has been introduced to the public and will surely gather more scrutiny.

Washington is gearing up to get involved. That means that we can expect the full power of Washington, not just the regulators, to be thrown behind protecting the retail investors from insidious short sellers and the bankers and prime brokers who are profiting beyond belief from these manipulative schemes.

The pressure is mounting in Canada, too, where laxer rules have been a huge boon for manipulators. The US short cartel has preyed upon the Canadian markets for decades as they know the regulators rarely take action. It is truly the wild west.

Just over a year ago, McMillan published¬†a lengthy report on the issue from the Canadian perspective, concluding that there are significant weaknesses in the regulatory regime.

While covered short-selling itself has undeniable benefits in providing liquidity and facilitating price discovery, and while the Canadian regulators‚Äô hands-off approach has attracted many people to its capital markets, there are significant weaknesses that threaten to bring the whole house of cards down.

McMillan also noted that ‚Äúthe number of short campaigns in Canada is utterly disproportionate to the size of our capital markets when compared to the United States, the European Union, and Australia‚Äù.

Taking Wall Street‚Äôs side in this battle,¬†Bloomberg notes that Wall Street has survived ‚Äúnumerous other attacks‚Äù over the centuries, ‚Äúbut the GameStop uprising could mark the end of an era for the public short‚Äù, suggesting that these actors are ‚Äúlong-vilified folks who try to root out corporate wrongdoing‚Äù.

Bloomberg even attempts to victimize Andrew Left‚Äôs Citron Research, which‚Äîamid all the chaos‚Äîhas just announced that it has exited the short-selling game after two decades.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Short sellers, particularly the naked variety, are not helping police the markets and route out bad companies, as Bloomberg suggests.¬†**Naked short sellers are not motivated by moral and ethical reasons, but by profit alone.**¬†They attack good, but weak and vulnerable companies.¬†**They are not the saviors of capital markets, but the destroyers.**¬†Andrew Left may be a ‚Äúcasualty‚Äù, but he is not a victim. Nor likely are the hedge funds with whom he has been working.

In a petition initiated by Change.org, the petitioners urge the SEC and FINRA to investigate Left and Citron Research, noting: ‚ÄúWhile information Citron Research publishes are carefully selected and¬†distributed¬†in ways that do not break the law at first sight, the SEC and FINRA have overlooked the fact that Left and Citron gains are a result of distributing catalysts in an anticipation of substantial price changes due to public response in either panic, encouragement, or simply a catalyst action wave ride.¬†Their job as a company is to create the most amount of panic shortly after taking a trading position so they and their clients can make the most amount of financial gains at the expense of regular investors.‚Äù

On January 25th, the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce¬†published its final report for Ontario‚Äôs Minister of Finance, noting that while naked short selling has been illegal in the United States since 2008, it remains a legal loophole in Canada. The task force is recommending that the Ministry ban this practice that allows for the short-selling of tradable assets without first borrowing the security.

The National Coalition Against Naked Short Selling ‚Äì Failing to Deliver Securities (NCANS), which takes pains to emphasize that is not in any way against short-selling, notes: ‚ÄúNaked short-selling transfers the risk exposure and the hedging expense of the derivatives market makers onto the backs of equity investors, without any corresponding benefit to them. This is fundamentally unfair, and must stop.‚Äù ###

for any doubters and shills. how will selling any amount of ape help shorts cover $amc?,"Title says it all, how does buying ape shares cover AMC shares? That's the play, isn't it? Yea many ideas about ape came out, but at the end of the day they have the same short positions on either stock (minus any variation in the short pattern since ape hit the market). That's like saying the pot of water won't boil because you turned off the opposite burner.

This is in no way shape or form financial advice, just a question that I'll be astonished if you can actually answer without a variation of ""it doesn't"".

Daily CEI updates and DD,"Highlighting a few reminders as we invest in this amazing stock! 

I‚Äôd like to start by reminding newbies, swingers, and day traders, that this is NOT a memestock or a momentum play. This is a medium- long term hold for those who are serious about where CEI is going and how far we‚Äôve come TECHNICAL WISE.

Without further adieu  let‚Äôs discuss some of the rumors, 
1. No reverse splits, Doris has made that abundantly clear and you can watch his latest Vlog to verify.
2. No delisting will be taking place. We are about to merge with VKIN, and if you refer to my last update. I explain why that simply doesn‚Äôt make sense at least for us

3. Rumors that the merger won‚Äôt happen. Guys, Doris has gone through a grueling paperwork process, been sandbagged by the SEC waiting for a response, then he went the extra mile to make DOUBLE sure everything was in place which prolonged the 10k just so he could mitigate any issues. And CEI actually owns over 61% of VKIN we seem to forget that very important detail. 

4. If you guys remember I sent Doris a PM and he responded, he said the same response in a tweet. And for those who didn‚Äôt understand. He basically is saying he UNDERSTANDS the market conditions are unfortunate but he DOES have a plan to help build value in the company and that strategy is DIVERSIFICATION. These new patents, contracts and agreements are to solve those issues but we have to merge first. 

And Lastly, we have the shareholder meeting tomorrow.  You should get a link with your login code in your email prior to the meeting! You will use that to get into the live stream! Don‚Äôt expect the world in this meeting, it‚Äôs not for that, however any good stuff mentioned will be a bonus!",CEI_stock,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CEI_stock/comments/xoxsp0/daily_cei_updates_and_dd/,DD,Soft_beauty2019,xoxsp0,/r/CEI_stock/comments/xoxsp0/daily_cei_updates_and_dd/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CEI_stock/comments/xoxsp0/daily_cei_updates_and_dd/,0,2022-09-26
I'm jealous of the US stock market,"I know it doesn't make much sense but as a British citizen I'm actually jealous of the US stock market. Their bull runs make ours look like a joke. Their currency is strong as hell, they have all the best tech companies in the world. They have the worlds only private space company. They have so much land that housing is way more affordable outside of major cities. They have tons of natural resources and don't depend on anyone really.

I'm not really a nationalist but I want to be proud of my country but right now it's so hard to do that. We have barely any tech companies, as weak as fuck pound, a stock market that's barely moved in 20 years, hardly any natural resources and record high house prices.

Short overview on $RGC and why it could be the next breakout stock,"Regencell Bioscience (NASDAQ: RGC) has a market cap of 387.784mil and is mostly owned by founder and CEO Yat-Gai Au, the largest shareholder with an 81% stake. On the other side of the coin, the remaining shareholders own roughly 19% of RGC stock.

Currently, insider owners own at least $333 million of the $416 million business. Both general public ownership (11.2%) and private equity ownership (7.6%) are still substantial, and it gives them some power to influence company decisions on performance and growth. Yet, while large enough to play a role, it's not big enough to change company policy.

Recently RGC published their results for their secondary efficacy trial to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of Regencell‚Äôs standardized TCM formulae in reducing ADHD and ASD symptoms through a holistic approach during the course of a 3-month treatment. 

The ongoing second efficacy trial using standardized TCM formulae have shown a mean percentage improvement of 21% in ADHD symptoms and a mean percentage improvement of 22% in ASD symptoms, based on the scoring systems under VADRS and ATEC respectively, after 3 months of treatment.

Besides that, RGC is the top performing stock of all 2021 IPOs according to [stockanalysis.com/ipos/2021/](https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/2021/). As of August 1, 2022, RGC is still ranked #1 with a 237% return above its IPO price of $9.50. 

The short volume ratio has similar pattern as that of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), whereby both averaged  over 40% in the past year.

How are we so backward?,"I know this is a question asked time and time again with little of an answer other than ignorance or propaganda. It is mostly a rhetorical question. But I am at wit's end thinking about it all.

I am so tired of hearing about Republicans. It used to be that we would have these political differences, but the good guys would win and the conservatives would adapt to the changing times. While I feel Republicans have never contributed positively to this country, they were at least always considered mainstream and discussed in a way that allows them to be apart of the conversation and spread their values.

But that shouldn't be the case anymore. I am amazed at how far right this country has become, where the GOP is considered a legitimate party with views that should be tolerated. They offer absolutely nothing. And frankly, I do not understand how anyone votes for them outside of total ignorance or pure hatred for humanity.

This country cannot even pass a law on universal health care. Marijuana is still federally illegal, and in many states, governors believe weed is bad for public safety. We have the largest per capita prison population in the world, with many of those people committing minor offenses or offenses that can easily be dealt with through rehabilitation. Everyone is up in arms over a $10,000 student loan debt cancellation. The governor of my state effectively outlawed all abortion, then a few days later promoted his campaign for $200 payments to all residents to help with inflation, instead of using our surplus for infrastructure, or homelessness, mental health services, and the like. Fast food workers are still paid $12/hour in many places, and despite billions of dollars in income, Starbucks is cracking down on unions. People cannot afford rent unless they work two jobs. Crime is rampant and the far-right has created a culture of racism and sexism I have not seen in some time. Income inequality is always increasing, and the system of capitalism we have been forced into is deteriorating. Meanwhile, climate change is still screwing us over and we can't reach any good progress on that. 

All of this to say: the United State is straight up like, not that great of a country. And I simply do not understand how nobody cares or even acknowledges this.

How do these Republicans (I am not saying far-right Republicans; one in the same) rally for these causes? Nothing they even discuss affects them. Do you really think these random Proud Boys from some town in Kentucky are feeling the impacts of immigration or trans rights issues? What are they fighting for, seriously, what is the actual normal Republicans' plight? My father is a Republican and it seems the only thing he cares about is the economy. This is messed up. First off, the economy is usually better under Democrat leadership. Second off, expand your mind and realize that there is more to this country's issues that the economy. Capitalism has warped our brains into not caring about anything else. Life is all about taxes. Well guess what? It doesn't have to be. Learn how to improve the country outside of capitalism and you unlock so many radical ideas (like providing health care for people who didn't ask to be born)!

We praise America for being the gold standard, but when I go walk around my city, I see homeless people posted up on corners asking for money from tin cans. I have to swerve out of the way of countless potholes. I can't go to a dispensary for a naturally-occurring plant; instead, I need to drop $100+ for medication provided to me by some pharma company that probably doesn't give a crap. I have to pay out-of-pocket to go to a doctor just to make sure I'm doing okay. I'm scared to ever go to the hospital, as it would surely ruin my life. My city can't even figure out mass transit, because Republicans refuse to fund it. It all sucks, because I *like America*. I like the people here, I like certain aspects of our culture and even my city I'm trashing is still something I have pride in. But these Republicans act like wanting change means you're anti-American. It's disgusting and sad. I want to see my community succeed, to prosper. Republicans obviously do not. They attack anything and everything that can actually help the greater good, in the name of capitalism/the stock market/American values.

Point is, I am done referring to Republicans has people to work with. They are not. They offer absolutely nothing positive to society. There should be zero tolerance for them at this point. The amount of complacency in this country is ridiculous. Things are not good here. They have not been for awhile. So it's time to wake up and actually use our progressive values for good. Because I really just don't want to live in a country that refuses to do anything to help its people. That's it.

Does David ever discuss this? I feel even he has become somewhat moderate, but I also don't keep up as much as I used to. I just find it important to acknowledge how drastically far away we are from true progress before we try to implement said progress. I believe it to be impossible at this point, and we are about to hit a fascist movement not seen since the 1930s.",thedavidpakmanshow,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/xons3u/how_are_we_so_backward/,,fragileego3333,xons3u,/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/xons3u/how_are_we_so_backward/,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedavidpakmanshow/comments/xons3u/how_are_we_so_backward/,0,2022-09-26
A Case for Blackberry (BB) ‚Äì Price Target: $46/share (2024),"Hello, I would like to post my thoughts on a company called Blackberry (BB), which I believe has strong potential. I‚Äôll start with an introduction and move onto some revenue projection calculations, the latter forming the main focus for this write-up. If you agree or disagree, please let me know your thoughts. \[Note: I did these calculations Aug 11 and this write-up a few days later, so valuations will have different numbers today due to the dip in the market. But, they would still be in the same range.\]

Many may remember Blackberry: the one-time leader in smartphones, that was displaced by Apple and then completely pushed out of the industry by Android. The company has transitioned into software and its stock has largely traded sideways, apart from joining the meme craze. Really, it‚Äôs probably impressive they avoided bankruptcy. The company‚Äôs main focuses are cybersecurity (with acquisition of Cylance) and QNX, an operating system present in over 200M cars (24 out of the top 25 EV manufacturers use BB) and also found in medical devices and other industrial-type devices that require a safe and reliable operating system. However, the focus of this write-up is an upcoming product called Ivy. Because it has not been released or included in projected revenue numbers, this discussion is speculative. However, I believe enough information has been released to make some rough projections.

**What is Blackberry Ivy?**

Blackberry Ivy is essentially a platform that allows data to be collected from car sensors and then processed either in the car or in the cloud. Applications written on Ivy can take that data and use it to produce actions within the vehicle. An advantage of Ivy is it standardizes the application development process. So if 3 or 4 car manufacturers adopt Ivy, a programmer can create an application on Ivy that can then be used by any of those manufacturers, rather than having to write 3 or 4 versions of the app for each of the manufacturers‚Äô software (Just like an Android app can work on different phones ‚Äì Samsung, Huawei, etc.). Ivy is a 50-50 joint venture with Amazon, but BB is the main player driving it.

**Why would manufacturers** **use Ivy?**

Manufacturers are very motivated to monetize the software experience in cars. Manufacturers can make money two main ways: financial payments (i.e. taking a cut from all payments made from a car ‚Äì fast food drive-thru, gas/electric station, tolls, etc.) and subscriptions (e.g. monthly payments for autonomous driving, heated seats, etc.). 

There are three main ways for the manufacturers to achieve this:  
 

1) Build the applications themselves. This is the most desired option for the manufacturers, but it is also terribly expensive and most will likely produce mediocre applications. It also makes it difficult for third-party programmers to build apps if each manufacturer is using their own custom software. 

2) Partnership with big tech (Apple, Google). This is what manufacturers dread the most. While they‚Äôd be happy for big tech to provide infotainment options, they don‚Äôt want to give their lunch away to big tech. Manufacturers do not want to be reduced to hardware manufacturers and see the big money in software. Even a partnership would likely have manufacturers nervous of big tech eventually taking over. While this option may be chosen by manufacturers, I think they will do their best to avoid it.

3) Outsource to a third party. Here is were BB comes in. BB has built a relationship with auto manufacturers over the last decade with the introduction of QNX. This has built trust between them. Unlike Google and Apple, who want to own the data, BB has promised to give the control and ownership to manufacturers. BB will also likely be first-to-market, giving it a jump over other competitors. Third-party programmers would also be able to build apps for any manufacturer using Ivy, creating a marketplace for applications. This is the most practical option for manufacturers, but the difficulty will be signing the first few manufacturers, then momentum will build.

&amp;#x200B;

BB views itself as the leader for the 3rd option, especially given their investments in cybersecurity. My calculations assume BB is successful in getting some manufacturers to adopt Ivy. BB says manufacturer interest in Ivy, at this point, is high. Decisions should be made in 2023, but I believe we could even hear something by late 2022.

I expect some manufacturers not to select Ivy, such as Tesla and 1 or 2 manufacturers who might go it alone (Ford?). However, once 2 or 3 manufacturers pick Ivy (VW? BMW?), the critical mass will cause others to join-up or fall behind. This is also how Android took over the last of the smartphone market from BB.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*CALCULATIONS\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

**What is Ivy worth to BB in revenue?**

This is a big question as, while QNX is a one-time payment believed to be roughly $3-4/car (assuming no additional services), Ivy is expected to be re-occurring revenue for the lifetime of the vehicle. 

Here I do some rough calculations (I show two different methods for determining revenue) and assume Ivy is adopted by at least some manufacturers. I don‚Äôt actually know what BB would charge, but since Ivy has similarities to Apple‚Äôs App Store and Google‚Äôs Play Store, I use those as benchmarks. Apple/Google charge 30% of revenue from apps, but also have a lot more leverage against app developers than BB has against manufacturers. On the other hand, BB will have to invest significantly in maintaining security and functionality. I am estimating BB would want at least a roughly 20% cut of revenue generated by manufacturers through apps. \[Note: This isn‚Äôt saying BB would sign a percentage deal instead of a flat rate deal with manufacturers, I‚Äôm just spit-balling what they would like the value to be near in order to create a baseline for revenue estimates\].

The next question is how much manufacturers could make from these apps, which would then allow us to determine what BB‚Äôs cut would be. Here I try to take into account the manufacturers getting a cut from all in-car purchases and potential subscription revenue. This is difficult to do. BMW was in the news for wanting to charge $12/month for heated seats. If fully automated driving happens, they could perhaps charge $300+/month. EV owners tend to be wealthier and spend more than the average person, but some people would avoid subscriptions altogether. 

I decided to use a starting point for average manufacturer revenue of $10/month/car ($120/year/car) as an estimate. This may be a conservative number, but allows me to do some rough calculations and provide a baseline. Again, this is just a baseline. I would expect the actual number, whatever it is, to grow over time as the software develops.

Ivy‚Äôs roughly 20% cut of $120/year/car would be $24/year/car. Since Ivy is a 50-50 partnership with Amazon, I am estimating then that BB would aim to receive $12/year/car.

The next question is how many cars would have Ivy? Currently, BB‚Äôs QNX is installed in approximately 20M new cars each year. I play-out two scenarios. First, where half of this QNX production adopts Ivy (‚ÄúHalf QNX‚Äù = 10M cars/year) and, second, where all of QNX production adopts Ivy (‚ÄúFull QNX‚Äù = 20M/year). \[Note: 20M QNX cars per year is just a rough estimate.\]

Here would be the estimated revenue (again, assuming a $12/year/car for BB):

Year 1 of Ivy ‚Äì 2024:

Half QNX adoption = $120M

Full QNX adoption = $240M

That is my estimated range of revenue from Ivy for BB, just in 2024. 

**How accurate is this estimated revenue?**

BB recently mentioned that they believe the SAM for Ivy-related products in 2024 will be \~$800M. My $120M-$240M estimate falls within this. The excess would include Tesla and any manufacturers who do not adopt Ivy. Even then, since BB believes there is no similar competitor to Ivy on the market, my numbers look to be conservative and may underestimate the revenue potential.

*{****Alternative method****: If you do calculations working backwards from the SAM estimate, Half QNX adoption could be valued at $182M and Full QNX adoption could be $364M just for 2024 (Based on \~20M QNX cars and \~2M Tesla cars.* *These revenue numbers are just BB‚Äôs revenue from the 50-50 Ivy partnership.).* *This is likely the better method as it avoids my arbitrary $10/month/car in* manufacturer *revenue and instead focuses on BB‚Äôs projection.* *I will continue to use both the more conservative numbers of the first method as a baseline and this alternative method as a comparison.* *Interestingly, this alternative method also suggests the cost BB is expecting to charge* manufacturers *for using Ivy will be approximately $36.36/year/car ($18.18/year/car of which will be BB‚Äôs share of the 50-50 venture) Note: These calculations assume that the entire estimated 2024 SAM is in the automobile industry and not other potential industries like aerospace and medical and that Ivy-like products cannot be retroactively applied to cars already on the road.}*

I have yet to see anyone on-line discuss BB‚Äôs SAM disclosure for Ivy-related products. I consider this a huge piece of information as it gives insight into what BB may look to charge for Ivy. This takes the discussion away from complete speculation to more reasonable estimates. Of course, BB is not guaranteed to get the price that it hopes for, but BB‚Äôs SAM estimates provide better foresight than random guesses on the internet. BB bears will rightly point out that these numbers mean nothing if BB fails to sign any manufacturer, but I am trying to determine what the future value of BB could be, not determining what its current value is.

The SAM disclosure can be found here @ 24:17 (Note: FY 2025 for BB is essentially calendar year 2024): https://wsw.com/webcast/oppenheimer23/bb/2273700

**Post-2024 Revenue Estimates.**

Assuming production of QNX cars continues at a rate of 20M per year and maintaining the same $12/year/car for BB from the first, conservative method, I did a further estimate of revenue for 2026. Keep in mind, this is reoccurring revenue, so 2024 and 2025 Ivy-installed cars would also be included.

Year 3 of Ivy ‚Äì 2026:

Half QNX adoption = $360M

Full QNX adoption = $720M

Keep in mind BB‚Äôs total revenue for FY 2022 (essentially calendar year 2021) was $718M. So, Ivy revenue could double BB‚Äôs total company revenue by 2026. 

*{****Alternative Method****: The alternative method would predict $545M for Half QNX adoption and $1.091B for Full QNX adoption for 2026.* *This is calculated by multiplying the estimated $18.18/car BB will receive for Ivy by the estimated number of cars (30M for Half QNX adoption and 60M for Full QNX adoption)}*

**What does this do for share price?**

This kind of revenue would turn BB into a high-growth stock. For valuation of BB‚Äôs potential share price, I look to the Price/Sales ratios of different companies. P/S ratios are not the only way to value a company, but, since these are rough calculations, they will give us a guide. A mature software company like Microsoft has a P/S ratio of 11. However, higher growth software companies tend to have higher P/S ratios like Crowdstike (26), Cloudflare (31), and ZScaler (24). Blackberry currently has a P/S ratio of 6 and is not priced anywhere near a growth stock. \[Note: These values were from Aug 11. These growth companies are now in the 20-25 range, which, while lower, is still close to my estimate\].

If we now consider BB to be a growth stock and estimate its potential stock price based on a P/S range of 10 to 30, my revenue estimates, just for 2024, would put the value of the company at between 2.5 to 8.3 times its current value \[Note: I did these calculations Aug 11 when the stock price was about $7/share and about $4B in market cap ‚Äì I used these rounded numbers in calculations\]. The corresponding projected share price would be between $17.30/share (Half QNX adoption, P/S of 10) and $58.10/share (Full QNX adoption, P/S of 30). This is only for 2024.

The share price in 2026 would be valued at between $27.53/share (Half QNX adoption, P/S of 10) and $101.48/share (Full QNX adoption, P/S of 30).

This provides a wide range. To determine a specific price target, I considered a P/S ratio of 25 and Half QNX adoption as being the reasonable benchmarks, which would give a price target of approximately $43/share (2024) and $69/share (2026).  The Half QNX adoption takes into account there may be unknown competition in the Ivy space or that some manufacturers may be slower to adopt Ivy. Remember, this is based on my more conservative, first method, not the alternative method using the SAM estimates.

*{****Alternative Method:*** *Using the alternative method based on BB‚Äôs SAM estimate, reasonable price targets would be $46/share (2024) and $77/share (2026)}*

Based on these calculations, BB could be a ten-bagger by 2026. Of course, it‚Äôs difficult to be a ten-bagger in such a short period of time and even more difficult to predict it, so I welcome your thoughts. Of course, these are just rough calculations and make a number of assumptions. But, as the alternative method is based on Ivy‚Äôs SAM as provided by BB, these numbers are insightful.

**Bear argument**: BB stalled Cylance growth after acquiring it and probably botched the recent patent sale, how can we trust management to pull this off?

**Bull counter-argument**: BB was so focused on this high-growth Ivy project, that the patent sale looks like pocket change in comparison and even the specific focus on cybersecurity products has taken a back-seat. 

**Final Thoughts:**

BB has stated we should hear more about Ivy revenue projections by the end of this fiscal year. That means I expect to know if Ivy will be a success by the March 2023 earnings call. There are two other earnings calls in the meantime (September 2022 and December 2022), where we may also hear news. That is a relatively short period of time to wait for news on something with so much potential as Ivy. Maybe it will be a flop, or maybe it will revolutionize the auto industry.

GEOJIT FINANCIAL SERVICES (NSE:GEOJITFSL) - Broker at a discount.,"Date: 26.09.2022; CMP: 47.75

I prefer ~~discount brokers~~ brokers at a discount.

I had invested in 4 companies the week before last. I wrote about 2 (OFSS and KSCL). I'll try to post an analysis on the 4th one (Zensar Technologies, if anyone is interested) soon.  Today, I'm writing about Geojit Financial Services. It's a short one (relatively).

Before that, I said I'd update if I sold out of any of the positions I wrote about, so updating here that I sold ASIANTILES today at 53.5/share. I tried to intraday trade the holding but it rose higher. I have this arbitrary rule to sell a stock I'm holding onto if profits get to less than 50% of their highs. I might jump back in if I get it lower.

Now, onto Geojit.

**About the company**

Geojit Financial Services Limited offers a complete spectrum of financial services. Key services include broking, margin funding, portfolio management and equity research advisory. The company also partners with other institutions like ICICI Lombard, Bajaj Allianz and Star Health to provide general, health and life insurance. It generates a small portion of revenues through the development and maintenance of financial software. The financial services and products component accounts for 95% of company revenues.

The company largely caters to clients that have delivery-based requirements in equity. Its products include Selfie (a trading and investment platform), Funds Genie (a mutual fund investment and analysis platform) and Smartfolio (a product similar to Smallcase).

**Company Metrics**

This company doesn‚Äôt need a detailed financial overview. Some key metrics should give perspective.

* Cash is 75% the share price.
* The company trades at 1.5x tangible book value.
* The company has negative net debt, a current ratio of 60 and an interest coverage of 26.
* The Graham number is 64.
* Dividend yield at current price is 6.3%.
* The company‚Äôs EV/EBIT (assuming the company gets book value of short-term investments) is 1.8. Less than 2 years‚Äô FY22 EBIT buys you the whole company.
* Stock trades at less than 2x NCAVPS (liquidation value) of 26.

**Valuation**

I value the stock somewhere between 60 and 75. This estimate assume an 8-10% growth rate in 3 year average net income per year and a 30% reinvestment of net income each year. I use a 16% and 20% discount rate for the base and conservative case.

This represents a potential 40%+ upside from current levels.

**What‚Äôs priced in?**

Another way to look at the stock is to see what assumptions we‚Äôd have to make to arrive at current levels.

If we assume the company reinvests 30% of net income each year and use a 20% discount rate - even if 3 year average net income fell 10% annually, the stock would still be undervalued looking out 3 years and just 5% overvalued looking out 10 years (i.e. net income falls 10% each 3 year average period over 10 years). If 3 year average net income fell 15% each year here on out, the stock would be fairly valued looking out 3 years and just 10% overvalued looking out 10 years.

Yet another perspective: 3 year average net income between FY18 and FY20 was 55,55 and 52 cr (TTM net income is 135 cr). Assuming everyone who entered the market and a few more that used Geojit‚Äôs services left their platforms such that net income here on out stayed constant at 50 cr (less that 2016-2018 average net income), the stock would still only be between 3% and 6% overvalued looking out 3 or 10 years.

The stock looks cheap any way one looks at it and offers minimal downside with 40%+ upside. I have 7.25% of my portfolio in this stock at an average price of 48.5/share.

"Pick a color, any color and you'll win 10% . China Stocks (A-shares)","Picking the right color will win you 10%. This is great for ""poor sighted "" people.  They dont have to search through all those confusing MA lines.  

You must realize banker/dealers can cheat on any indicator.  If you use MACD,KDJ or RSI, they can mislead you because afterall, they are painting the picture of the incdicators.  But one thing they cannot cheat on is ""VOLUME"". Simply put, if nobody is buying, how can the stock go up?  So that's why volume is crucial.

Let me explain using colors to represent volume. The following are some of yesterday's 10% stocks.  

[Pick a Color, any color](https://preview.redd.it/ugkqjo2vq8q91.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5a0833618f3d5232d3228ac263b635aa69a6d30)

But there are so many! Which one should I choose?  Well, let me first explain what the color means, they represent degrees of volume during trading session:

&amp;#x200B;

* low= COLORMAGENTA;
* mild= COLORYELLOW;
* active= COLORORANGE;
* average= COLORGREEN;
* Heavy volume= COLORMAGENTA;
* Huge amount= COLORGREEN;
* weird/strange= COLORYELLOW;

After running many tests, I have found that Orange/active volume is the most steady winner.  You dont want to go with heavy, huge and weird volumes although they will also get you 10% ,they are just not as steady. What I want is ""STEADY"" wins.

It works great on its own but I changed it a bit myself to fit it to my personal needs.  So, If I know what color is most steady, there is no need to see the other colors.  So, I just weed them out and the result is thisÔºö

The scenario we described in our [Hot Take](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6978424807331635201-_zX3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop) is playing out: Markets are melting everywhere, and the bond holders which were buying and holding with their eyes closed are now taking large losses as rates increase. When will the pain end?

# Fed Hikes 75 bps

&gt;**TLDR: worse case scenario averted, but forward expectations show 125 bps more hikes.**

The market took the news in stride, but the follow up rhetoric was very tough on inflation as expected and markets tanked. The Dow Jones index broke down below the 30,000 level as of the end of Friday. Rates markets had a similarly bad reaction, with 10y rates reaching decade highs of 3.70%.¬†

## Global Catch Up

&gt;**TLDR: Super Thursday -¬† 9 central banks respond following Fed hikes.**

Everyone from the Philippines to Norway are [increasing rates](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-09-22-2022/card/central-bank-interest-rate-increases-come-thick-and-fast-on-super-thursday--3q5MfNKretWwP21gmhpj?mod=article_inline). Meanwhile Turkey has cut their rates despite nearly 100% inflation rate. But clearly it‚Äôs not enough, the U.K. just released a budget with meaningful [tax cuts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-announces-package-of-sweeping-tax-cuts-11663926079), causing the pound to go down 4% intraday to multi-decade lows.

Needless to say, the U.S. sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold.

## Energy and Commodities Ease

&gt;**TLDR: One bright spot is crude oil, which tanked 5% to below $80 a barrel on Friday.**

Energy prices tanked partially due to Fed hikes, along with expectations of lower demand due to global rate hikes. Agricultural products also came along for the ride with similar sized drops.

The impact of these price drops will take some time to flow through the economy,¬† but the combination of these factors leads me to believe‚Ä¶

## Ivan‚Äôs Take

We are at the peak of pessimism. Most of the future hikes are priced in, while inflation data has been slow to come down, it is coming down in the US. With mortgage rates north of 6% and lower commodity/energy prices coming down the pipeline, it‚Äôs likely that we are approaching a level of tightening that will meaningfully cool the economy.

Other international factors at play include a resolution to the Russia Ukraine conflict, and China‚Äôs slowing economy, which will also translate into lower inflation into the U.S. due to depreciating currency. Perhaps I‚Äôm overly optimistic about pessimism? We shall see next week!

"How did we miss this?! A ""Spectator Mode"" Case Study: With Tuesday Morning &amp; EXPR at the risk of bankruptcy/delisting again, how does it affect GME/the meme basket?","**TL;DR:** 

* **Based on the common reasons for delisting (usually having a stock go under the $1 mark for an extended amount of time), fellow meme stock EXPR is at heavy risk for delisting.**
* **In addition, heavily shorted (once to the tune of 92 days to cover) Tuesday Morning ( TUEM) is as well and--to my knowledge--beat the record for most days under $1 at 167 days, beating Bethlehem Steel's record of 157 days.** 
* **Hedge fund Ayon Capital and Retail Ecommerce Ventures ('REV"") recently threw a lifetime to Tuesday Morning as its at risk of bankruptcy using (ahem) convertible debt financing. Sound familiar? Similar to what had affected GME and other meme stocks. REV also owns properties like Linens n Things &amp; Pier 1 Import who (surprise surprise) are already bankrupt.**
* **This brings up the question that hope we can track over the next few days: what happens to meme stocks when they are at risk of bankruptcy/delisting a 2nd time/post-sneeze. Can they be delisted again after all, or do the mechanics of MOASS-centric stuff stuff mean that they can't be? My initial guess is one possibility is that they might resolve to go private ASAP, so that the CUSIP info/FTD data is lost as GME's MOASS causes sneezes all over the market.**

&amp;#x200B;

[from the original \\""Spectator Mode\\"" post](https://preview.redd.it/6epr17pz29q91.png?width=1676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30f1eada5db13df7d66093a4d28f9399b3f68491)

Hi y'all. Will keep push this out quick for now and build additional edits as I go. Just trying to get this out as fast as possible.  


Long story short, one of y'all in the comments brought up in the Daily on Friday that fellow meme stock Express (EXPR) that's in the meme basket along with GME was barcoding, ping ponging between an incredibly dense spread of $1.10 to 1.12 or so.

&amp;#x200B;

[EXPR's movement over the past 5 days. Notice anything about Friday's shape relative to the other days?](https://preview.redd.it/yd9b2myk19q91.png?width=1385&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=081cef140740886d46f4065f84611996e87adef7)

Yes, much of it can be explained the balls low volume: recent days have been trading far more lower than average volume, and you see that the values above are still less than 1/2 of average trading volume with an hour to go until market close.

**This stood out to me for a few reasons, not least of which it was crazy to see barcoding over 2-3 cents (!) on a stock trading on the public stock market. But even more so because of the line it was hovering over: the $1 line. This is often a do-or-die line where stocks gets delisted, and I first wrote about this in my post "" Spectator Mode: Zombie Stock Birthday Songs &amp; The Delisting Death Rattle"":** [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sp5xwx/spectator\_mode\_zombie\_stock\_birthday\_songs\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sp5xwx/spectator_mode_zombie_stock_birthday_songs_the/)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w01sc6yk29q91.png?width=1263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c656e794bef5621a7540859f3b0a9cffaf23433a

 The relevant TL;DR: 

&gt;**TL;DR:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Although delistings can sometimes hit the market all at once, like in the dotcom crash or the 2019 Chinese stock delistings, on a case-by-case basis delisting rules are applied super inconsistently....**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Despite different reasons, some stocks are delisted the day after while others for up to 2 years after first being warned. Staying under $1 a share for an extended amount of time can be a common reason for delisting across exchanges.**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Apple reseller Cool Holdings had been partnered with GME. Its stock got a shit ton of FTDs around the time it was at risk for delisting. It got delisted a few months later right before it needed to pay back GME, who was dealing with its own financial issues and FTDs.**

As I talked about in that post, delisting rules are applied SUPER FUCKING INCONSISTENTLY. 

 

https://preview.redd.it/nhj5fgt739q91.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1349991e8c37b26205e25b8b101c126709861735

 

&gt;Since more than 1 exchange exists (like the cumwaffles at BATS, the mayo-dripping MEMX, crime-filled ""Expert Market"", or the badasses at IEX), exchanges generally have close-ish rules for delisting stocks off their exchanges. **Different rules apply as to why a stock might be delisted across different exchanges but here are the main ones most of us know:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Don‚Äôt stay under $1 for a long time**  
&gt;  
&gt;**File regularly**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Keep a solid market cap**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Surprisingly, one late 2000s study found of all the reasons, listing at under the $1 requirement was #1 cause for delisting for Nasdaq, #2 for NYSE. Hm‚Ä¶**  
&gt;  
&gt;Ok, sounds good! Well, just as long as the rules get applied, then investors can sleep at night right? Well, let‚Äôs hope these rules are consistently applied!

[from the original post](https://preview.redd.it/a34wjxuv29q91.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8090a8f2c5547de28adc0258a8204209fae60d7)

Nope!  


&gt;**Inconsistent application of delisting rules, where some violate them but still trade for months or years later (Bethlehem Steel in violation of the 30 day rule for 157 days--where a stock needs to be above $1 or not get delisted). Others get the ax pretty much right away (Mutual Risk Management after violating the rule for ONE FUCKING DAY)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bankruptcy delistings are inconsistent, with some being booted the day after (Global Crossing), others after a month (Enron) or others TWO YEARS LATER (Owens Corning)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Even when firms are caught doing immediate fucked up shit (Enron) it‚Äôs not grounds for immediate delisting**. (Surprise fucking surprise)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; **Researcher Yu Zhang said historically not only do heavily shorted stocks generate BIG negative returns (price drops), they are almost most likely to be delisted**.... **On Oct. 24, 2018, NASDAQ delisted Sears. They listed the reason as trading below $1 a share for 30 days.** It closed near 0.38$ on its very last day. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/frw3u7bp49q91.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bffef0131da21e715ca9f4d260537a6598d3d1b0

With EXPR being so damn close to the event horizon of falling into delisting, it made me wonder if we could see a case study of the following: what happens when not just a heavily shorted stock but a ""SNEEZE"" shorted stock risks bankruptcy?  


As GME holders, we all like to talk about GME is never going bankrupt thanks to the awesome positioning by RC, Mat Furlong and the support of all you awesome GME holders. But what happens when any of the other meme stocks do run at risk of bankruptcy/delisting? **Can they be delisted and the same ol' rules apply with some hedge fucks and MMers breathing a sigh of relief? Or what if they can't?**

What made me dig into this even further is that I was refreshing info for an old post that featured another stock we are all familiar with: ""Tuesday Morning"". I wrote about them in Pt. 1 of ""The Big Mall Short"" and found out a lot (which actually drove me down that CMBS rabbit hole.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cvzc87g259q91.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b0573abd567fb9fe6a8fe710174440031709436

The relevant TL;DR there?  

**Tuesday Morning (ticker TUEM) had a high amount of average trading volume near the sneeze:** In fact, TUEM started trading on January 13th, 2021. It opened with about 200-500K worth of trading volume in mid-January, **then its price edged up on 1-2.5 million shares traded between Jan. 21st-27th during the sneeze**.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tsezypat59q91.png?width=1564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ac7580897e1349b424d6616aa5fba0680f962f6

But then it had even WEIRDER abnormal-er trading volume where the price flash-crashed in mid-Sept. with over 20 million shares traded then bubbled back up. Per Yahoo Fud!nance: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Tuesday Morning Corporation (NASDAQ:TUEM) was sure having a rough Thursday morning. The retailer's stock was down by more than 39% on the back of fresh quarterly results.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tuesday Morning is not followed by many analysts (*fOrGeT Tuesday Morning? Chukumba much?*); Yahoo! Finance lists but a single one‚Ä¶‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

[you can see the flash crash numbers in Sept here](https://preview.redd.it/gwy5cn2u59q91.png?width=1540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58f57d6f2eed9b348a5bc79d0b9d3180a7967d48)

**Even crazier, the company's ticker TUEM WAS NOT ITS FIRST. It had actually gone previously bankrupt in 2020, and was heavily fucking shorted so bad that it had 26% short interest with 92 days to cover (!). Even the same dude that had been talking shit about towel stock saying it was going bankrupt because ""the stores were cutting AC"" (Neil Saunders) was talking shit about Tuesday Morning back then.**

&amp;#x200B;

**So why is this relevant? Here's its price action now:**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t947ottb69q91.png?width=1017&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db45ee9f3cb577f18b17224da7acada035284a29

**Since April 19th of this year or for the past 167 days (more than Bethlehem Steel, which was at risk of delisting for 157 days!) it has been floating under the $1 mark. It has been at risk of delisting this entire time and this also potential pseudo-meme stock has not been delisted yet.**

Now caveat: even my own post/research found this shit gets applied inconsistently and as of recently, they got a lifeline a few days ago after one of its heads announced her departure on August 12th and rumors of a second bankruptcy filing grew. 

Of course, though with all this bankruptcy talk, I hope that there wasn't any fuckery right?

&amp;#x200B;

[fuck you investor place](https://preview.redd.it/z7jrwl1389q91.png?width=1815&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4aad0dafd5e39f4b7392373fec24f6b4d9d53409)

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;**Tuesday Morning** (NASDAQ:[**TUEM**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tuem-stock-quote/)) stock is soaring higher today as investors boost shares amid talk of a potential bankruptcy filing.  
&gt;  
&gt;TUEM stock has had a rough time lately. Reports now claim the company is considering filing for bankruptcy protection. That, alongside the recent loss of its CFO and guidance cuts, has pulled shares lower these last few weeks.  
&gt;  
&gt;**However, it now looks like meme traders see all of this as a green light to invest in TUEM stock. As a result, shares are climbing today with heavy trading. Some 31 million shares are being traded as of this writing; the company‚Äôs daily average trading volume is closer to 1.9 million shares.**

**Wait what? Meme traders? I'm sorry...are these taint sommeliers blaming US again? Let's take a look at this totally normal chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[yes totally fucking normal, a stock reaching its entire outstanding shares over 2 days, perfectly normal ](https://preview.redd.it/brr9ni8i89q91.png?width=1495&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19971dd6e119403557ed608857c4a08d8cf0f8be)

**I'm too lazy to debate whether there's even a chance that there is SOME bad actors that will use all our ""It's Tuesday Morning!"" memes as eventually bullshit excuses to say meme traders have been buying up this stock as a result but I'm 100% sure that exists or will exist at some point in the future by a hedge fucko rubbing his nipples pulling off his best Shaggy (singer not Scooby Doo) impersonation**.

&amp;#x200B;

Which bring us to Ayon and Retail Ecommerce Ventures.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hiz9gui899q91.png?width=909&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abfc2f45bbccb901a0f2b8788770aeb416745e5b

As of a little over a week ago, a hedge fund and retail portfolio company gave out a lifeline to them.

&gt; **Tuesday Morning** has received a **$32 million** investment from **Retail Ecommerce Ventures** (REV), the parent company of **Pier 1 Imports**, **Linens ‚Äòn Things**, **Stein Mart** and other brands, and Ayon Capital. The funding, along with **$3 million** in convertible debt financing from certain Tuesday Morning leaders including CEO Fred Hand, will help the troubled retailer implement an omnichannel turnaround plan. 

**Convertible debt financing? OH WAIT THAT NEVER GOES WRONG (see popcorn or even GME back in the day). Even juicier, look at who the fuck REV owns: Pier 1, Linens n Things are ALL bankrupt.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Another perfectly normal FTD chart for Pier 1 imports](https://preview.redd.it/tgfimasw99q91.png?width=1107&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9bc6d5df0c05272e05dc03eb481725d351ae7f7)

So what does tell us now? We know that the meme basket theory has been proven to be true over and over again (credit to criand and all the other DD writers for the creation of the theory and verification of it!) but we know that these pictures evolve. Look no further than what's happening with sticky floor rn and its new dilution.

&amp;#x200B;

But what does it mean for the  meme basket? As of right now, I'm not sure what this tells us but it should be tracked. Because there are a few possibilities:

1. **SHFs and MMs still need these companies to go bankrupt, and delisting is the track they need to be on as they were originally meant to be (including all the naked shorting to MMs heart's content)**
2. **SHFs and MMs still need these companies to go bankrupt, but they CAN'T delist them anymore (see EXPR's barcoding over the $1 line possibly, or the 167 day stretch of TUEM not getting delisted).** 

**If #2 is the case, then maybe it's a possibility that there might be a way that some of these firms are looking to avoid MOASS for some of these other stocks, and something that Ayon might point too: take them private ASAP. This way when MOASS squeezes it eliminates the fallout as much as possible without perhaps some weird shit happening IN CASE these stocks can't normally delist anymore.**

&amp;#x200B;

[remember kids, WE didn't cause the third impact](https://preview.redd.it/1kvi62i5b9q91.png?width=498&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af0794b04d86eb9847d0e5ff0eba4ee0a87c175e)

As mentioned this is a completely new aspect for the meme basket (meme stocks perhaps at risk of going bankrupt a 2nd time) so I have no idea what will happen. **Maybe old delisting rules don't work anymore, and going private ASAP is necessary because it also hides the bodies as fast as possible (can't track all the CUSIP numbers as easily imagine once a company is sold off for parts).**",Superstonk,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/xotp6z/how_did_we_miss_this_a_spectator_mode_case_study/,üìö Possible DD,throwawaylurker012,xotp6z,/r/Superstonk/comments/xotp6z/how_did_we_miss_this_a_spectator_mode_case_study/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/xotp6z/how_did_we_miss_this_a_spectator_mode_case_study/,0,2022-09-26
A pickup truck for firesmarting!,"I'm in the market for a used truck for work that's reliable and is able to tow a 16ft trailer up and down a mountain hwy. I'll have mostly brush and logs. We have a GMC 2500hd that pulled our trailer but it's not mine. We were able to carry a full trailer of fire wood without any struggle. The trailer I'll be using has brakes and a full wiring harness. 

I'll be mostly be working about a 4500ft above sea level. I don't need to drive a lot of km to do this job because there's a brush fire pit near where I live. Sometimes I'll have to bring a load to the town dump which is another 1500ft lower in elevation. I'd be carrying a full load down the MTN but not up. 

What should I look for in a used truck? I'd prefer a 4 foot bed, a 2 door or 4 doesn't matter. I want to find something that's stock but if it has an aftermarket bumper and hitch that's a big bonus. I'm not sure if I will need 4x4 or if I should just go for studded tires all round in the winter. Some of these driveways around here are very steep so that's another thing to consider.

Investors yank $138 million from company planning merger with Trump's Truth Social,"Investors have pulled almost $140 million in commitments to a ""blank-check"" company planning a merger with the parent company of Donald Trump's Truth Social forum, the latest stumbling block for the proposed deal.¬†

Digital World Acquisition Corp., a so-called¬†[special-purpose acquisition company](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-media-technology-group-investors-digital-world-acquisition-spac/), said in a [regulatory filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312522250281/d384791d425.htm) on Friday that unnamed investors have sent ""termination notices"" representing about $138.5 million of $1 billion in commitments to the merged entities. ¬†

Digital World didn't immediately return a request for comment. Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/some-investors-backing-out-spac-merging-with-trumps-media-firm-2022-09-23/) that one of the investors that had withdrawn its commitment to the merger is Sabby Management, which had pledged $100 million. Sabby Management also didn't immediately return a request for comment.¬†

Shares of Digital World fell 17 cents, or 1%, to $16.33 in Monday morning trading. The stock has plunged 68% this year.

The merger between Digital World and Truth Social's parent company, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, has encountered numerous headwinds this year, including investigations by both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Digital World earlier this month [asked](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-truth-social-merger-vote-delayed/) its shareholders for more time to complete the merger because of delays caused by the probes.

The SEC probe in particular is a setback for the company because the agency needs to sign off on the Digital World-Trump Media merger for it to be completed. Trump has called the investigations politically motivated ""witch hunts.""

## Delay allows investors to bail

Because of the investigations, Digital World has asked its shareholders to approve more time to consummate the deal, which had been slated to close September 6. But earlier this month, the company [failed](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-truth-social-merger-vote-delayed/) to muster enough shareholder votes to support a one-year extension to complete the deal. Digital World has since [pushed back](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-truth-social-merger-vote-delayed/) its shareholder meeting on the vote until October 10.

As first envisioned, the merger between Digital World and Trump Media &amp; Technology Group would transfer $1.3 billion in funding to the former president's media company. About $300 million was expected to come from Digital World, while the remaining $1 billion was pledged by institutional investors through a so-called ""private investment in public equity"" investment, or PIPE.¬†

As part of the agreement with PIPE investors, they may exit their securities purchase agreements if the deal was not closed on or before September 20, according to Friday's regulatory filing.¬†

Digital World said it is also possible that the PIPE could be restructured or renegotiated ""in view of the PIPE closing conditions, evolving market and regulatory conditions.""

I'm a British citizen and I hate that my country is falling apart,"I am a 33 year old British citizen and I'm old enough to remember when the UK used to be a power house of an economy. The great London Stock Exchange was the envy of the world along with the NYSE, the GBP was head to head with the dollar and companies around the world wanted to list on the LSE.

Students would come to the UK for university and stay here after to build their companies. Now they are going to America after their studies instead. I know the world in general is a bit of a cluster fuck at the moment but it just seems like the UK in particular in falling apart at the seams.

Record high house / rent prices makes living unaffordable.

Record low GBP makes purchasing foreign goods expensive.

Brexit

A stagnant stock market that has barely moved in 20 years.

Lack of technology companies makes innovation very difficult.

All we really have left to brag about is our universities are still some of the best in the world.

What Is a Liquidity Crisis?,"A liquidity crisis is a financial situation characterized by a lack of cash or easily convertible to cash assets across many businesses or financial institutions simultaneously.

In a liquidity crisis, liquidity problems at individual institutions lead to an acute increase in demand and a decrease in the supply of liquidity, and the resulting lack of available liquidity can lead to widespread defaults and even bankruptcies. 

In simple words when individuals and institutions start demanding their investments and returns simultaneously in form of cash and businesses, institutions are unable to provide that due to illiquid assets leading to such a situation. 

\- **A liquidity crisis is a simultaneous increase in demand and decrease in the supply of liquidity across many financial institutions or other businesses.**

\- At the root of a liquidity crisis are widespread maturity mismatching among banks and other businesses and a resulting lack of cash and other liquid assets when they are needed. 

\- Liquidity crises can be triggered by large, negative economic shocks or by normal cyclical changes in the economy.  

**Most of the major economical crises in the world are related to liquidi**ty. In the 2008 crisis, banks gave out home loans irresponsibly to everyone without checking an individual‚Äôs capability to pay back. This led to a huge liquidity crisis.

Best Worst Case: We Lock the Float by February 2024. Weekly Analysis 9/27/22,"**TA;DRS: Yay more shares, lock by February 2024, for the free float degenerates: lock by September 2023.**

Not a lot of news this week - we had some slow circle days the past few weeks, but looks like we're picking up steam again.

This may move up a bit next week - JonPro03 hasn't updated the Reddit Scraper portion of Computershared since early Saturday, so we're missing a few days' data. Hope you're well, Jon!

# The Update

[Technically, the date moved into January, but as I realized I don't have holidays built into my projection, it's probably 12 trading days later than this.](https://preview.redd.it/21210f51ufq91.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=974373eed68d54a0d5e33456d02db0004478c38f)

What the colors mean:

* Green - the most likely - uses only repeat DRS data from 2022 and excludes clear outliers as everyone moved the bulk of their shares from 2021 in their second DRS post. (The top 2021 weeks were several times the average - way outside of norms.) \*This is starting to change with the post-splividend wave. May revise this in the fall.
* Yellow - less likely - uses all repeat DRS data back to September 2021.
* Red - the least likely - this is just how long it would take based on total DRS power (hard to predict first time buys) and what would happen if no one registered anymore shares. As well as when Gamestop could buy all non-registered shares directly.

To compare against last week: [9/19/22](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/xij13x/best_worst_case_we_lock_the_float_by_february/)

For what it's worth, even though I'm giving dates, don't set your clock by this stuff - I'm just doing the math to see where it ends. These dates are going to move based on how fast/slow first time apes DRS. I'm not predicting THE DAY, I'm just looking at how many more ""one more days"" shorts could possibly have.

Reminder that this is all worst case. All of these predictions assume NO further dividends, NO insider buys, and the only buying pressure from apes that feed the bot more than once.

# Introduction

What is the absolute longest it could take apes to lock the float? How many ""one more day's are left in SHF? This analysis looks for just that. Assuming no other news, buy ins, or turnarounds, no new apes registering shares for the first time, no good news at all - how long would it take for apes with recurring buys to lock the float?

By relying on a data-backed model predicting price trends, DRS bot and Reddit Scraper bot data, and a few assumptions, we can predict the longest it could take to lock the float based on the last closing price.

This is a great post for a couple of reasons - mainly, it's an analysis tracking options on ETFs that tie back to predictions of price runs. (A better explanation of cycles, if you will.) [u/-einfachman-](https://www.reddit.com/u/-einfachman-/) dropped a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/txnwhu/checkmate/) that goes into great detail on capturing efficiency of lowered prices. They meant it in terms of a stock dividend increasing the total number of shares, but it also applies to an algorithm reliably dropping the price each day.

# Assumptions:

**THE PRICE IS FAKE**. Due to dark pools, buy-writes, married puts, volatility swaps, naked shorting, and a mayo-crusted bedpost, the price is largely controlled by an algorithm with the exception of unexpected large insider buys.

Apes don't have piles of cashing hanging out to FOMO in anymore. Recurring buys are now on a regular basis.

‚ÄúExisting Accounts‚Äù are shares bought by those that already opened a Computershare account and are adding to their position as much as they can as regularly as they can. This clearly ignores the ‚ÄúScout and Reinforcement‚Äù style of registering so many have done, but without getting more detailed data from our AMAZING DRS gurus, I can‚Äôt control for that. (Not saying I particularly want that data, but if there were a way to see unique (still anonymized) data, I would further refine this.) If IRA's start getting registered like I think they will post-splividend-gate, there's not a good way to keep this from skewing data.

Everyone is DRSing as fast as they can. Shares posted on a date are assumed to have been bought the week before due to settlement and transfer times. (On the Friday before if posted on the weekend.) As we've seen with the uptick in DRS reported in the June call, plenty of apes are registering and *not* posting it. If people with auto-buys aren't posting the first and fifteenth of every month, it means this analysis underestimates the recurring spend, which means the day we lock the float will be *before* anything in these analyses.

Most apes that registered a few shares to figure out the process then sent all of their shares to CS later did so in 2021. By excluding 2021 buy data, we can see a more accurate picture of what apes are spending on moon tickets each week. (This is backed up by the highest priced weeks being in 2021 clear outliers in the data.)

There are a lot of moving parts, so I wanted to add contingencies for A) Inflation, B) the presumed algorithm driving price down in an attempt to stay alive just one more day, and C) Gamestop's short hammer - $101M earmarked for buyback.

**Inflation:** We don't want to discount that we've just started the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Inflation is real. Because JPow go BRRR, I've added 2% inflation each quarter. Yes, there are better ways to calculate this, but we should expect to lose some purchasing power in the coming years. I‚Äôm assuming 2% per quarter since we've hit 8% or above a year.

**""Float"":** Personally, float means everything but insider shares. Once all of those shares are locked, if anything is reported ANYWHERE else... Smoking gun, naked shorts, MOASS, etc. Others argue that MOASS starts when we overlap with reported shares in Edgar - that is the institutions, ETF's, mutual funds, et cetera. I dislike ""free float"" as a metric because those fillings are updated, at best, quarterly. It is certain to start a spasm in the market though once we have more than the stated free float.

**""Taste the Rainbow"" Rate of Price Decay:** We know the price won't stay constant. In fact I'm a strong subscriber of the ""One more day"" shorting crush to keep the price from going over a margin call line. To further illustrate, [u/TiberiusWoodwind](https://www.reddit.com/u/TiberiusWoodwind/) put up a great series of posts [here (external link to DD library)](https://online.fliphtml5.com/lvrgy/fhlb/#p=1). If you follow this line of thought, the price has to be knocked down on a regular slope to avoid ~~a margin call~~ something, and that price intercept / danger zone is constantly approaching zero. The more frequently the price hits that line, the more frequent the halts, grayed-out buy buttons, and other unpredictable BS. This analysis tests and repeatedly confirms the slope is -0.5% per trading day.

**Gamestop Buy Back:** Gamestop has $101M in cash on hand for a buy back. This is the ultimate middle finger to hedgies - if the price gets too low, the trap card is activated and Gamestop buys every single non-registered share and takes the company private-ish (At least private between apes and insiders). Gamestop Can't Fail.

# Methodology:

I‚Äôve copied over the data from the Reddit Scraper table ‚ÄúShares Counted‚Äù from Computershared.net.

I pulled the past year's price data from [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) and came up with an average cost for the day based on the day‚Äôs high and low. (Would love some extra thought on this. Maybe average that number with closing cost to account for those buying at market open/close?)

Shares registered multiplied by the average cost of a share the week before equals apes‚Äô regular buying power that day.

To project that forward, I summed up money spent each week by existing accounts, then averaged.

For funsies, I‚Äôve applied the same methodology to total number of shares posted in DRS bot to see what our average weekly DRS cost is including new accounts. This is pretty specious as it requires new accounts to continue being created at the rate they have been ‚Äì which at some point will have to stop because we‚Äôll all have DRS‚Äôed and no new blood will join.

In order to predict the buy pressure across all accounts and not just those feeding the bot:

1. I take the high score of accounts and divide by the average number of accounts per ape.
2. Then I take the percentage of apes that have posted more than once (in the comments of Roid\_rage\_Smurf's updates) versus the whole multiplied by the above.
3. I divide the average weekly buy by the number of apes that posted more than once.
4. I multiply step 3 with number of apes in Computershare (step 2)

So let‚Äôs assume that this cash is our regular allowance from the wife‚Äôs boyfriend. A regular spend rate, if you will. We can now calculate how far down it will be before we lock the float barring any other influences like one-time DRS apes, dividends, insider buys, and MOASS. (I think it's safe to say at MOASS, we won't be locking the float until sometime later.)

Now that we know how much money we will have, we need to know the price. We use the rate of decay from Taste the Rainbow (about half a percent per trading day) and apply that forward until our daily DRS buy eclipses the remaining float.

All of these predictions are based on apes registering AND REPORTING more after their initial account set up at Computershare. To accelerate things: if you're registering more and haven't updated the bot, please do so. This rolls your additional buy into the average!

All these predictions COMPLETELY IGNORE one-time bot-feeders. These brave individuals are taking their shares out of DTCC but are not influencing the ""regular"" buy pressure. The more that register - even once - the faster this goes as they're raising the floor brick by brick.

# ""Want now! What Do?""

""Mup, you crusty queef stain, I'm in this for the immediate gains! Get this out of here!"" How do we accelerate this from here?

Social Media - if you know a hodler, ask them to register their stash. And don't just think of people you know. Apes are among us. Two people know I'm an ape in real life. We need to get a little louder and get the non-stonkers on the bus.

If you've read this far and haven't registered your shares, I'll assume you are trapped in a crap broker or tax advantaged account. If you're not, why haven't you locked your float?

Retirement Accounts - we need to push investor relations, RC, the board, et cetera to allow Computershare to hold retirement accounts for GME. Yes, you can risk a Custodial account. Yes, you can take the tax hit. The easiest way to get more shares registered is to get retirement accounts accepted RISK FREE.

APRN - Everyone loves to buy high and sell low,"What‚Äôs up everyone.

Follow up to my last post.  Previously, I posted about APRN when it was at 5$ and it ran to 8$.  Today I‚Äôm unfortunately going to explain why most of you aren‚Äôt making money.

Background - APRN had a private placement set to close on august 30.  When it ‚Äúclosed‚Äù, aka no one heard anything for a while about it eventually getting amended, the stock rallied in that time frame.  Currently, we are approaching the new date, September 30, and are sitting on higher short interest, high options ramp to October 21, and the price is below the placement.

If you really sit and think why people presented this stock previously, you realize that you are even better off considering it now.  Across the board, except the overall market picture, the situation has improved.  Logically speaking, why wouldn‚Äôt you at least begin DD again and potentially enter the trade.

Trading and investing all comes with proper preparation - if you saw it then, you even moreso see it now.

As always, no PT‚Äôs given, but I have a feeling that September 30 onward, we are heading to 5.65 (placement price) and beyond.",Shortsqueeze,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/xp9a6t/aprn_everyone_loves_to_buy_high_and_sell_low/,Discussion,Zealousideal-Yam-375,xp9a6t,/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/xp9a6t/aprn_everyone_loves_to_buy_high_and_sell_low/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/xp9a6t/aprn_everyone_loves_to_buy_high_and_sell_low/,0,2022-09-27

Using country Delight is so complex,"Ordering groceries from country delight is such a tiresome task. There are so many things that simply require too much effort from the user.

1. **UI:** Their UI is so complex and confusing that I often get lost in the app. Maybe it is a part of their strategy to make user spend more time on their app or there is some psychology level hack to it, I don't know but it is crazy.
2. **Confusing features:** I want to order groceries, not give an aptitude test                               
One of the biggest problems is that you want to order a product for tomorrow but it ends up starting an everyday delivery is a pain. Even to figure out how to stop it is a pain in itself. The experience can simply be like the other apps that are there in the market. Zepto, Blinkit,   
 Instamart and even Milkbasket have such a simple and easy to use UI. 
3. **Out of Stock or out of sense:** There is a reason I am ordering groceries a day in advance because i wan to avoid all the last minute pain and hassle but they do the exact opposite. The app will take your order but deliver half of the next morning with a rationale that things were out of stock. Now it's your job to panic and arrange groceries at 7 AM in the morning. 

I understand that they send the good stuff but the dread of opening the app everyday because I can't avoid is just too much and hence I think its better to rely on some other apps.

Buy and Hold Trading Strategy in the Forex Market,"# Buy and Hold Strategy in the Forex Market

The ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù strategy is quite popular in the stock markets but is often seen as useless and even dangerous in the Forex market. Many books simply state that this strategy cannot be applied to forex trading. 

While there are certain limitations in using the buy and hold strategy in Forex compared to the [stock market](https://howtobloggingmarketing.quora.com/Best-Investment-Newsletters-What-is-an-investment-newsletter), it is a viable technique which can appeal to many traders and investors specializing in the forex market.

As its name suggests, it consists of two stages. The first is a process of selecting and buying one currency against another. The second stage of this technique is based on keeping the position open for a period that can last even several years so that the price of the currency bought rises against the currency sold. 

Despite the fact that the name of this strategy only uses the word ‚Äúbuy‚Äù, in reality the trader is not limited to buying positions only. Sell ‚Äã‚Äãtrades work just as well in the Forex market.

**The main features of this system are the following:**

* Possibility of obtaining high profits in the long term.
* It is a trading style that allows you to ‚Äúopen and forget‚Äù new trades.
* Positions with a positive interest rate spread offer additional income as this spread is added daily to the trader's account for each additional day the position is held open in the market.
* On the contrary, positions with a negative interest rate differential accumulate costs for this item that in the long term can be significant.
* The strategy does not have clear entry and exit criteria.
* It requires a lot of patience, especially if the swaps are negative.
* The broker must be reliable and stable enough to keep a position open for years.

# Setting up and using the strategy

* The selection of a suitable currency pair plays a fundamental role in these strategies. Ideally, the selected pair should pay a positive swap (due to a positive spread in their currency interest rates) in the direction of the trade. But that part can be ignored if the negative swap is insignificant relative to expected long-term earnings.
* Fundamental  factors  should be a high priority in this strategy. Long-term considerations such as central bank policies, global economic development, and trends in unemployment rates can help inform a decision.
* A ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù position must be opened with the minimum leverage or with enough free margin in the trading account to prevent countermoves in the market from causing a margin call, forced closure of the position or even catastrophic losses.
* The exact moment of opening the position, although it can be used to obtain some additional advantage, is not as important as in conventional Forex trading which is mainly speculative. Waiting too long for a pull-back to occur that offers a better entry point can cause us to miss the opportunity to open a long-term position and should only be considered in special cases.
* An extensive waiting period should be employed in this strategy. It is not uncommon for ‚Äúbuy and hold‚Äù positions in the Forex market to last for years and even decades.
* The output of this type of operation is even more complicated than the input. Ideally, a long-term foreign exchange investor exits his position only when there is a need for capital or market conditions have changed dramatically. Alternatively, these trades may be closed when high profit levels have been reached or the level of loss has become intolerable.

The image above shows a long-term chart (monthly time frame) of the USD/CHF which covers the period from 1999 to the end of 2012. In this case the price of this currency pair has been moving in a steady downtrend for all that period of time. 

The price has fallen from a maximum value of around 1.8300 (mid-August 2012) to a minimum value of 0.7064 in the month of April 2011. As the graph shows, the fall in the price has undergone upward corrections that in no time have they broken the downtrend line, so a short ""buy and hold"" position that would have been opened between 2000 and 2001.

Stop pretending that this might not screw us,"Half a billion dilution on APE is a big fucking deal. It eliminates some AMC debt, but could also be another giant roadblock for us to get over. 

If they (tutes) somehow get majority vote (since ape has same voting privileges), they can vote to convert those half billion shares into AMC shares and cover and or close a fuckload of shorts. This hurts our short squeeze potential, or at the very least kicks the can down the road several miles. Whats to stop them from creating synthetic shares and ruling the vote? The SEC? The people that are in their pockets? 

Can we stop pretending that this is a good thing? AMC eliminates some debt or refinances some of it, that doesn't help any of us retail investors. My account is still red, yours is still red, AMC paid off like 1/5 of their debt though. It helps AMC as a company that's a fundamental play. That's it. Not us. 

The only pounce I've seen has been on us, we're nearly back down to where we started. Where is the share recall/recount, justice for crime against the company? I've put a lot of money into this and I'm pissed off. I'm tired. Tired of the hype and subsequent disappointment every fucking time that something is supposed to be the catalyst. 

Nobody is coming to help any of these meme stocks. We're going to have to do this on our own, and we need more than buy and hodl, because it ain't working chief. We need more than strongly worded letters and emails. 

The only thing that is going to get results is millions of angry people on the ground not taking No for an answer from the SEC/Government/DTCC and demanding stock market change. Until then, nothing is going to change.

Quick Lie Detectors on the Internet: Or How We Know the Liars Who Often Attack Trump.,"Frist, the biggest lie on the Net is If you buy X, tghen you get Y, frfee.

Point ofr logic. If you buy something, then it's not free. Because you have to buy something to get something else, it's not free. Taht is a global ads tadtic and it's caca del toro, and falls to the outragious contradiction of facts it is.

Next, we se the It's more, it's better, it's healtheir5, the Comparative Adjecive lie.

Every comparative, to be true MUST have a meaningful Objecet. It's bigger than a house. It's more than just $10. It's the size or, or lartger than a beebee or a pea. Saying that some product ""x"" si better, ore more, or other words without an objedte, is totallly meaningtless. And that's the p4oblem with that.

The last, an beggest lie of all we see on the net, ar3 the 3-4 word phrases that get tossed out, often on the final screen of the ad. Subaru is for Love. BS, it's a profit driven business like all the rest.
Buidling Begtger. B etter than what? An expert construction company? A good stock investor?
We are not told because it's BS.

IF YOU can learn to detect the BS, adn then buy the product ,prepare for trouble. Liars lie. YOu buy for quality and price, that gtive you the most value for the least cost. Not bettger, or because you get something exta th5's not free; or some trite meaningless 3-4 word phrase that's as emty of balue as sand in your 

carburetor.

Went to the market. Found store brand honey nut kind of brand, 21.2 Oz. for 30 Cents less for 19 oz. fro same. Better buy, by comaprison process? Clear cut. Same product by taste, for less. That's how it[s done!! Compare, compare, compare, and that creates the info we need for good decision making.
Don't be fooled by the madia and their lies, IOW.

And tehse are how we detect the liars also, who attack Pres. Trump.

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 tried to bounce back from their lowest closing levels in nearly two years.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1%. Those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 157 points, or 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The British pound rebounded slightly after plunging to a record low against the dollar earlier in the week. Sterling traded more than 1% higher at $1.087 per dollar after hitting an all-time low of $1.0382.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields also came off their highs, boosting sentiment. The benchmark 10-year yield dipped nearly 5 basis points to 3.823%.
*****
&gt; The move in futures comes after five straight days of losses for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at its lowest level since 2020. The Dow dropped more than 300 points on Monday, putting it in a bear market after falling more than 20% below its record high. The 30-stock average also posted its lowest closing level since late 2020.
*****
&gt; Technical indicators show that the selling has been historic. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the 10-day advance decline line for the S&amp;P 500 has hit a record low, meaning market breadth is at its worst level in at least 32 years.
*****
&gt; The latest round of selling appears to have several catalysts, including an aggressive Federal Reserve and surging interest rates, which in turn have roiled currency markets. On Monday, the British pound slid to a record low against the dollar, unnerving investors on both sides of the Atlantic.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúTypically, US investors wouldn‚Äôt care too much about something like this, and especially more recently. And so this to me says that now there is this fear that is gripping investors a lot more than it did before. That in turn will lead to a capitulation moment where we really are at a bottom,‚Äù said Max Gokhman, CIO at AlphaTrAI.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, investors will get several new pieces of economic data, including September consumer confidence, August durable goods orders and July home prices. Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned that the Fed‚Äôs six-month-long inflation fight will push the economy into a recession.

&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.8%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1%. Those tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 157 points, or 0.5%.
*****
&gt; The British pound rebounded slightly after plunging to a record low against the dollar earlier in the week. Sterling traded more than 1% higher at $1.087 per dollar after hitting an all-time low of $1.0382.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields also came off their highs, boosting sentiment. The benchmark 10-year yield dipped nearly 5 basis points to 3.823%.
*****
&gt; The move in futures comes after five straight days of losses for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at its lowest level since 2020. The Dow dropped more than 300 points on Monday, putting it in a bear market after falling more than 20% below its record high. The 30-stock average also posted its lowest closing level since late 2020.
*****
&gt; Technical indicators show that the selling has been historic. According to Bespoke Investment Group, the 10-day advance decline line for the S&amp;P 500 has hit a record low, meaning market breadth is at its worst level in at least 32 years.
*****
&gt; The latest round of selling appears to have several catalysts, including an aggressive Federal Reserve and surging interest rates, which in turn have roiled currency markets. On Monday, the British pound slid to a record low against the dollar, unnerving investors on both sides of the Atlantic.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúTypically, US investors wouldn‚Äôt care too much about something like this, and especially more recently. And so this to me says that now there is this fear that is gripping investors a lot more than it did before. That in turn will lead to a capitulation moment where we really are at a bottom,‚Äù said Max Gokhman, CIO at AlphaTrAI.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, investors will get several new pieces of economic data, including September consumer confidence, August durable goods orders and July home prices. Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned that the Fed‚Äôs six-month-long inflation fight will push the economy into a recession.

Is this a good time to move sell NYSE listed ETFs and buy on TSX?,"I have a bunch of unregistered investments in NYSE listed ETFs (such as [ITOT](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239724/ishares-core-sp-total-us-stock-market-etf)). I bought these when I had USD cash and was too afraid that I'd mess up Norbert's gambit.

These are a mild headache because
- I don't foresee ever using USD, so I'll have to convert them at some point.
- I have enough that I need to fill out a T1135 for the CRA. I don't mind doing this, but I'm mostly afraid they will find a small error and impose some draconian penalty.
- I might move them to an RRSP at some point, but AFAIK I'd have to sell first.

Now that USD to CAD conversion rates are favourable, is it a good idea to sell these off and buy something like VGRO instead?

How did I know we was going to dip,So if you have realised yet there‚Äôs algorithms and everything is rigged what I‚Äôve learnt the worse time to invest is the first 30 mins of trading opening (noticed I said invest not trade) i am not a trader I am investor. Anyway during market open you have order fulling contracts being wrote etc too much noise in my opinion the best time to invest is between 90 mins and 4 hours of the market being open that gap there when volume is lower noise is lower people are busier that‚Äôs the time to buy where as open usually in the case of this beloved stock go up then dips or goes down then up only to dip (when I say dip I don‚Äôt mean go red just drop in price),Superstonk,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/xpi0cn/how_did_i_know_we_was_going_to_dip/,ü§î Speculation / Opinion,InvestorUK2019,xpi0cn,/r/Superstonk/comments/xpi0cn/how_did_i_know_we_was_going_to_dip/,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/xpi0cn,1,2022-09-27
Deadliest Duty/Self defense ammo? Super vs sub? Q Honey Badger 7‚Äù truck gun for patrol vehicle,"Just got my first .300 and trying to understand it‚Äôs ballistics better.  In my AR I use Brown tip (Barnes 70gr vor-tx)

I currently have .300 Barnes Vor-Tx 120gr (all that was in stock not sure if 110gr is superior) currently but am curious what else is on the market, is their 110gr better?

Chinese officials have asked fund managers &amp; brokers to help stabilise the stock market ahead of the 20th Party Congress. Do you think US-listed Chinese stocks like Alibaba (BABA) &amp; Didi Global (DIDI) might rally?,"Chinese officials told some fund managers and brokers recently to avoid major equity sales ahead of the Communist Party‚Äôs five-yearly Congress, which will be held in about three weeks time.

The order, which aims to avoid big market fluctuations, was orders were given verbally by the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges through so-called ‚Äúwindow guidance‚Äù, or unofficial policy directives with no written documents, one source said.

‚ÄúThey asked (us) to avoid abnormal trading activities, including massive sell-offs and buy-ins. Basically it‚Äôs a move to stabilise the market,‚Äù the source said.

Another buy-side source said they also received the notice. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs politically sensitive,‚Äù the source explained. They asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. 

China‚Äôs ruling Communist Party opens its 20th Congress on October 16. It is likely to end with President Xi Jinping anointed for a third, five-year term as the supreme leader and a shuffle of personnel on the decision-making Politburo.

In late July, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) vowed to maintain market stability ahead of the Party Congress, saying it will ‚Äúresolutely‚Äù prevent big and swift swings in capital markets.

A compliance officer at a Shanghai-based mutual fund house said he had not received window guidance, but that helping to ensure market stability ahead of the congress ‚Äúis a natural responsibility‚Äù for fund managers.

China‚Äôs main stock benchmark CSI 300 has lost roughly 6% so far this month, and more than 20% so far this year.

Risk appetite has been dampened by gloomy growth prospects as Covid outbreaks, property market woes and heightened geopolitical tensions hurt economic growth.

China‚Äôs Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

"Credit Suisse course at all-time low, rumours, bosses in panic mode","**There's a fire in the roof at Credit Suisse**

The big bank Credit Suisse is running out of time. The stock is in free fall and the rumor mill is churning. Only at the end of October does the CS top want to inform about the future of the bank. Then it might be too late.

Credit Suisse does not come to rest, although the leadership around President Axel Lehmann (63) and CEO Ulrich K√∂rner (59) is trying everything to calm shareholders, employees and customers. The slogans to persevere are becoming more and more urgent, panic is brewing, patience is required. For example in an internal memo that was made public over the weekend. There is talk of an ‚Äúambitious schedule‚Äù. You are making good progress with the ""comprehensive strategic review"" of the bank's business model, as it also says in a media release from CS on Monday.

The problem: the CS leadership has run out of time. Only on October 27 does the bank want to explain what its future should look like. Then it might already be too late. The CS leadership has already underestimated the time factor. The talk of the ""transition year"" cost Thomas Gottstein (58) his job as CEO in July. The year 2022 can no longer be a year of transition, it must be the year of the rescue of Credit Suisse.

**Can the tactics of the CS top work?**

The calming pills and perseverance slogans calmed the markets somewhat for the time being ‚Äì but only briefly. The CS share recovered temporarily from the all-time low of CHF 4.04 on Monday, but closed again in the red. There were probably some bargain hunters at work during the day. As long as the CS leadership does not come up with a convincing new strategy, there will be plenty of room for rumors and speculation.

**What could the new strategy look like?**

The only thing that is clear is that the CS investment bank has to be shut down. Will it be smashed in whole or in part? Will investment bank First Boston be rebranded? With its purchase at the end of the last century, the bank entered the USA on a large scale. A withdrawal from the US market could even be imminent in this business area. Asset management with services for institutional investors is also available. The new CS should stand on two pillars - global wealth management and a strong Swiss bank. A kind of UBS light.

**Why is the stock market price plummeting?**

The CS share price has more than halved since the beginning of the year because investors cannot see which business model the bank would like to use in the future. The latest crash was triggered by rumors of a multi-billion dollar capital increase. Because that would dilute the value of the share, the previous investors would lose even more money with the title. However: CS urgently needs money for the dismantling and conversion, so it should hardly be possible without additional capital.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is the CS worth anyway?**

Not much anymore. At the moment, the big bank is still worth almost eleven billion francs on the stock exchange. Significantly less than their book value, which is around CHF 45 billion. This means that the stock exchange values ‚Äã‚Äãthe entire bank significantly lower than the sum of the individual parts. With this market capitalization, CS is only worth a little more than the private bank Julius Baer. The finance portal [Tippinpoint.ch](https://Tippinpoint.ch) estimates the value of the largest cantonal bank, the Z√ºrcher Kantonalbank, at around CHF 20 billion - significantly higher than that of CS.

**Why are there no prospective buyers?**

Because nobody wants to burn their fingers on it. Anyone who buys the CS is dealing with a large mountain of problems. The realignment of the bank initially costs a lot of money before profits can flow again later. European banks have problems of their own; the US banks would have the necessary ""small change"", but they would have more of it if CS withdrew from the US market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Who really needs to worry?**

Shareholders and employees in particular have real cause for concern. Because nobody knows where the deep fall of the once so proud share will end. Only at zero is it really over. The bank's realignment will not take place without major job cuts. There is talk of 3,000 to 5,000 jobs, i.e. about a tenth of the workforce. Only the customers of the Swiss bank can look to the future relatively calmly, because the Swiss business is solid.

**Good Morning**

The market delivered another huge disappointment on September 26 as benchmark indexes fell more than 1.6 percent, reflecting a fall in global peers amid rising recession worries. **The considerable selling by FIIs, as well as currency devaluation versus the US dollar**, impacted the mood.

On the daily chart, the Nifty50 has produced a lengthy bear candle with a gap-down opening, indicating a market decline. Despite the fact that the 50-stock index has fallen about 1,000 points from its high of 18,000, there is little evidence of purchasing emerging from the trough.

The Nifty's main **support level is set around 16,900, followed by 16,850**. If the index continues to rise, the major **resistance levels to monitor are 17,200 and 17,320.**

**Bank Nifty:**

Following severe selling pressure from higher levels in the aftermath of the Fed pronouncements, the Nifty Bank has violated critical support at 40,000 on a closing basis. This supports the breakdown. The index is still in a sell-on-rise condition, **with a resistance level at 40,500 and the next support level apparent at 39,000.**

**The pivot point,** which will serve as critical support for the index, **is set at 38,300, followed by 38,050. The important resistance levels on the upside are 39,100 and 39,500.**

**SGX Nifty:**

Trends in the SGX Nifty indicate a somewhat bullish start for India's wider market, with **65.5 points higher**. On the Singaporean exchange early Tuesday Indian time, the Nifty futures were trading **around 17086.50 at 8:15 IST.**

**US Market:**

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the day down 1.11 percent at 29,260.81 points, while the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.03 percent to 3,655.04. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6 percent to 10,802.92 points.

**At 8:15 Dow future is trading with 190 points plus 29534.**

At 7:15 a.m. on Tuesday, the Nikkei rose 0.68 percent, while the Shanghai index gained 0.40 percent. The Topix index increased by 0.66 percent. The Kospi in South Korea was slightly higher, and the Kosdaq gained 0.64 percent.

**Call/Put OI Data:**

According to exchange statistics, the biggest call open interest is gathered at the strike price of 17,500, with 1.7 lakh contracts, and the next highest at 17,700, with 1.4 lakh. The largest put open interest, on the other hand, is at 16,000, with 1.4 lakh contracts, and at 17,000, with 1.3 lakh.

"As part of the community, I would like to say some words. What we thought we knew is not really what is going on.","You may not agree with me, and this is ok.  My grandma had a saying, and it goes like this ""not everyone is a gold coin"".  Now let me explain what this saying means, it means that you can't like everyone and that not everyone is going to like you.  Having said that I have seen a lot of people who have called themselves apes, and who have said I will hold for you if you hold for me, talk bad about others and call others shills, in fact I have been called a shill myself.  No one can have a different perspective of things otherwise they are hated on.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen Trays video and I saw it all the way to the end, and I agree with him.  As the Ape army we like to call ourselves we are not united.  Many of us came in for the money and we have found that there is crime going on in the Market and decided to stay for that reason.  We are all falling apart at this moment because we are all in the red, we do not consider that everyone else who is in this play are also in red.  We said we had a conviction that we loved the stock, but yet today we are all at each other's throats.  Tray mentions on his video that he has people constantly attacking him for them being in the red.  Many of us have said that we will wait as long as it takes.  Some of these people attacking Tray may not be you all, but I have seen posts where people have said that he is a traitor, twists the words he says.  He said he is not going to talk about AMC anymore because of this reason.  He does still believe in the play, he said he isn't leaving, but he does see that not being an ""influencer"" is going to help all of us grow.  Now I don't know about that because I had never seen his videos before, and I learned to do my DD on my own.  I have done my DD by reading many of the posts that you all have contributed to.  I do believe we need to grow and if we are determined to fight crime in this market than we need to be united.  We need to stop the bickering and weather this Storm together.  Just like we pumped ourselves in the beginning, lets pump ourselves again.  Please remember we are all human and we all have feelings and loved ones that we would not like to get hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

We are going through a storm, a real heavy one.  If you all haven't noticed all the stocks are down, not just AMC and APE.  Some of us work for a living and we have always said we will buy more, and we will hodl and we will buy more.  I hold AMC, APE, and GME.  I would have never imagined myself holding stock in the stock market if it weren't for you all.  I'm talking to the ones that pumped me up, not the ones that called me a shill and down voted me to oblivion when I said certain things.  It isn't bad to seek information, it isn't bad to look at the media, it isn't bad to watch youtubers, it isn't bad to read books, it isn't bad to read articles.  It is bad to not seek the truth, it is bad to not be informed, I know many of you do not believe in the Bible, but there is a quote there that I really like, I'm taking this out of context, but it helps me in my everyday life; ""1 Thessalonians 5:21-22 Test everything; hold on to what is good, reject what isn't good"".  I bet many people are going to bitch and moan about me quoting the Bible, but we don't do this, and it is a good principle to live by.  I went to a twitter meeting with twitter Apes tonight, and they talked about what is happening with this dilution issue that we have come across today.  Many of these people that were talking there, explained that this proposal is not happening anytime soon.  There are many more things that I didn't know that I found out by attending this conference.  This is why I urge you all to have an open mind and to start acting like we do love each other as Apes.  No matter what you do with your money in the future, stop letting people know!  We are at war; We have said these many times.  You do not let your enemy know what your next move is going to be!  I recommend for everyone to read the whole clause with the selling of 5m shares of ape, there are a lot of things there that I didn't know before I spoke out.  I already know what they are because I was at this twitter conference, I told you all about.

&amp;#x200B;

If you were here and read all of my rant, thank you, it is more than I deserve.  I have issues in my life, and I don't consider myself to be better than anyone else.  In fact, I consider myself to be a nobody.  I hope that you can agree to my point of view and if you don't it is ok.  Please let's get back to basics which are, we love the stock, we hodl and we buy more.  Let's be patient with one another and respect other people's opinion.  Remember that we are all Apes now, we are a family of strangers that got together by chance do to GME having a mini squeeze that was shut down by crime and that now we are here fighting for a fair market.  Things will take time!  Learn patience and become informed.  

I would like to apologize if at any time I called any of you a shill and you were not.  Let's be careful of the real SHF that infiltrate our communities, let's not give them an inch by being aggressive toward each other.  Above all be patient in this bear market, ride the wave.  I'm holding my shares, first for me, and secondly for you all.",amcstock,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/xp4j4q/as_part_of_the_community_i_would_like_to_say_some/,Discussion üó£,OriginalRagerFox,xp4j4q,/r/amcstock/comments/xp4j4q/as_part_of_the_community_i_would_like_to_say_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/xp4j4q/as_part_of_the_community_i_would_like_to_say_some/,0,2022-09-27

Interest rates matter a lot to the Equity Market. Also Quantitative Tighetening,"#Why do Interest Rates to the Equity Market?   

These are the reasons I think how interest rates affect the equity market (these reasons are inter related)  

**1) Portfolio allocation:**   

When interest rates go up, people increase their debt allocation &amp; decrease their equity allocation. So lesser money goes into the equity market.   

**2) Risk Premium:**   

Why do people investment in equity instead of in safe bonds &amp; debt? It's the hope of a higher return from equity.  

If interest rate I get on a risk free bond is 5%, then I would invest in equity only if I hope the get 7% return from equity (these are imaginary numbers used just as example). If the interest rate was instead 7%, then I would invest in equity only if I can get 10% from equity - i.e. with the increase in returns from risk-free investments go up, the need to invest in investments with higher risk goes down. In 2020, interest rates went down all the way to almost 0%, so more &amp; more money got diverted into stock markets.  

**3) Cost of capital for Businesses:**   
When interest rates go up, the cost of capital for businesses taking loans increases.    

Net income = Operating Income - Interest Expense - (other stuff).  

So profit goes down when interest rates go up.  

**4) Intrinsic value of a stock:**   

When we do a Free Cash Flow analysis of a stock to find it's intrinsic value we discount future free cash flows &amp; future residual value using a discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows in a discounted cash flow (FCF/DCF) analysis. Discount rate goes up if interest rate goes up, discount rate goes down if interest rates go down. Hence whenever interest rates goes up, intrinsic value of stocks go down &amp; vice versa.

Let's take a simple example. Let's say company has free cash flow of Rs. 100 each year for the next 5 years &amp; then a residual value of Rs. 800 at the end of 5 years. Now the intrinsic value of this company can be calculated as 

Discounting Rate = D   
n = no of years   
Present value = (Future Value)/(1+ D)^n

Let D = 5%   

Year | FCF (Rs) | PV (Rs)  
---|---|----
1 | 100 | 95.24
2 | 100 | 90.7
3 | 100 | 86.38
4 | 100 | 82.27
5 | 100 | 78.35
Residual | 800 | 626.82  

Total Value = Sum of last column = Rs. 1060   
If there are a total of 100 shares of the company, then intrinsic value = **Rs. 10.6** per share

Now say the interest rate goes up &amp; discounting rate goes up to 7% (assume fcf remains the same - it actually may go down, but let's ignore that)  


Year | FCF (Rs) | PV (Rs)  
---|---|----
1 | 100 | 93.46
2 | 100 | 87.34
3 | 100 | 81.63
4 | 100 | 76.29
5 | 100 | 71.30
Residual | 800 | 570.39


Total Value = Sum of last column = Rs. 980   
If there are a total of 100 shares of the company, then intrinsic value = **Rs. 9.80** per share

So the value of the stock went down from Rs. 10.6 to Rs. 9.80 because of an increase in interest rates.

The US Fed rates have been mostly on a downward trend for 40+ years now - https://imgur.com/p2cRWIa.png - one of many reasons for decades of a secular bull market.

Most people in the market have mostly spent last 10-15 years with very low to zero interest rates. As Taleb said ""Basically experience in finance with a discount rate near zero is like having studied physics except without gravity.""

---  

#Quantitative Tightening (QT)

From 2008 on, the US feds have been feeding money into the system by buying debt. When the debt matures, they renew it so that money remains in the system. This is Quantitative Easing (QE). And from 2020, they increased the QE. Now, they have stopped QE - i.e. no more new money pumped into the system.

Other than stopping QE, they have started a passive form of Quantitative Tightening where they no longer renew the QE debt which matures. Their plan was to take out 145 Billion$ out of the market from June in the first 3 months &amp; then 270 Billion$ more in the 3 months after that. This a passive form because they also can start selling QE debt which hasn't matured which will be active QT.

QE was the 2nd reason for a secular bull market for more than a decade &amp; the 2021 super bull was also because of increased QE.

The amount QT which has happened till now is very less &amp; more is to come unless there is a Fed Pivot - https://imgur.com/63fPSSW.png

A lot of people keep saying that we are going to ATH soon.

It happened as projected! Citadel Cycle Swaps theory holds true! With bonus HKD tie-in,"**Note to apes of new: Give me a few minutes to add images. This note will be removed when images are all added.** 

I‚Äôm a quiet ape. I‚Äôve been here since before the beginning, watching, buying, learning. I‚Äôm not a financial ape, just a humble ape with a knack for patterns and big pictures. [I have 496 shares purchased directly through CS and 100% DRS in my name](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/xpkkhz/i_put_my_money_where_my_mouth_is_428_for_the_bot/). Everything below is my own due diligence, is not financial advice. We are individual investors who happen to share common end goals. I chose to share this theory because this community has given so much to me, most importantly this investment opportunity.

**First, if you aren‚Äôt familiar with the Citadel Cycle Swap Theory, or need a refresher**, go read my posted titled [Citadel swap cycles, Headphones, the meme basket, and the tombstone tweet. A detailed look at how we got here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vn0kyi/citadel_swap_cycles_headphones_the_meme_basket/) ""MEME STOCK"" = Popcorn. At the time (due to my first post??) even ""popcorn"" was banned. The rest of this post will make a lot more sense and the read doesn‚Äôt take too long. 

Seriously, you‚Äôre doom scrolling Superstonk New upvoting purple circles, go spend a few minutes and read it. 

**Then go check out my short update on August 9th** [REVISITED: Citadel Cycle swaps and RC 11 dimensional chess. Recent action hints I was right?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/wkhitl/revisited_citadel_cycle_swaps_and_rc_11/) for a fascinating ‚Äúin the moment‚Äù read on what was about to happen, and my call on BBBY. 

I apologize for the term ‚Äúmeme‚Äù but im lazy and for this post it works. I detest the MSM use of the term. 

# Tinfoil moon hats strapped on? Buckled up? Let's jump in! 

**Scientific Method**

*noun*

1. a method of research in which a problem is identified, relevant data are gathered, a hypothesis is formulated from these data, and the hypothesis is empirically tested.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/yngxh0n8nfq91.gif

In other words, we have a problem: **The major market participants and regulators as a whole are complicit in criminal market manipulation to destroy companies and profit.** 

I‚Äôve gathered the relevant data from Citadel‚Äôs own reporting and used readily available market capitalization data to spot a unique pattern.

Next, we need a hypothesis to test.

The hypothesis as outlined in my previous posts: 

1. **Citadel (among other market participants) are involved in large off the official books swaps involving GME, Popcorn, BBBY, EXPR, KOSS, BB, and NOK. Ryan Cohen knows this.** 
2. RC Ventures has made two large GME stock purchases, each time causing these swaps with popcorn to flip against Citadel. Approximately 133 days after the first swap flip against Citadel, we had the January 2021 sneeze. 
3. **August 15th 2022 was approximately 133 days after the swaps flipped against Citadel for the second time. Therefore, these stocks should spike and/or act oddly the week of August 15th 2022.** This spike or odd behavior should be less than Jan ‚Äô21 because RC ventures purchase was only 1.6% of the company vs 9.6% in August 2020. 

\-----------------------------

**THE TEST PART I: SHOW ME THE DATA**

Pictures are worth a thousand words: here are stock prices, last 3 months for GME, popcorn, BBBY, and KOSS all spiking exactly as predicted:

\[GME CHART\]

\[popcorn CHART\]

\[BBBY CHART\]

\[KOSS\]

And my favorite because no one is talking about EXPR, anywhere. It just magically follows and no one would be the aware if it‚Äôs buy button wasn‚Äôt removed in Jan ‚Äô21.

\[EXPR CHART\]

Those are some very volatile yet coordinated jumps across a unique set of stocks. It seems like they are pulling up the entire market:

\[SPY CHART\]

\[DOW\]

\[NYSE\] 

Note: Crypto starts crashing on Saturday August 13th. Liquidity? HKD can only go so far (keep reading for the HKD tie-in)

\[Bitcoin CHART\]

\[Etherium chart\]

&amp;#x200B;

**THE TEST PART II: RC KNOWS**

**A key piece of the hypothesis is RC‚Äôs awareness of these swaps and is making financial moves and communicating via twitter based on this knowledge.** 

[August 16 and 17th RC sells entire BBBY position for $68.1M profit.](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/other-memes/ryan-cohen-made-a-very-profitable-trade-with-bed-bath-beyond-stock#:~:text=GameStop%20Chairman%20and%20activist%20investor,after%20the%20news%20was%20released.&amp;text=Ryan%20Cohen%20sold%20all%20of,halting%20the%20BBBY%20meme%20rally) This sale then causes the entire stock market to crash /s 

# Or

It took nearly three weeks for Citadel and company to swallow the load and we appear to be back on the same algo downward slope as before that August micro sneeze. 

RC ventures has made four declared financial transactions, two GME purchases (technically August 2020 was two purchases 5,800,000 shares and 415,326 making it five total declarations), one BBBY purchase, and one BBBY sale. 

The two GME purchases led to sneezes and the only sale occurred during the second of these sneezes. I lost several nights sleep debating investing in BBBY options after my post in June, I didn‚Äôt. However, I think it was a win win for RC. He either gets what he wants from BBBY and can fight Citadel on two fronts, or he pulls the rip cord during the inevitable sneeze. He just needs to know which path within the 133 days. These are my own opinions and, I for one, am happy to see that gain porn! 

**RC knows. Warren Icahn knows.** 

\---------------------------------------

**CONCLUSION: HYPOTHESIS IS CORRECT, SWAPS EXIST AND MANIPULATE THE MARKET**

&gt;Both times RC ventures has made GME purchases, the swaps with popcorn flip against Citadel, and approximately 133 days later all hell breaks loose! To my knowledge, no other theory, or TA projecting this behavior. 

\-------------------------------

# SO WHAT? Why does the Citadel Cycle Swap Theory matter?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**It means there are tens or hundreds of millions, maybe billions, of synthetic shares in the market.**   
&gt;  
&gt;**It means we must HODL! Patience is on our side**   
&gt;  
&gt;**It means that RC is watching and will strike at exactly the right time.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**However, for it to be the right time, we must first DRS.**

"Denmark, Germany and Poland warn of ‚Äòsabotage‚Äô after Nord Stream leaks - Berlin says Russia‚Äôs involvement cannot be excluded after damage to gas pipelines at centre of Europe‚Äôs energy crisis"," ***""The destruction that happened...is unprecedented. It's impossible now to estimate the timeframe for restoring operations of the gas shipment infrastructure"" - Operator of Nord Stream*** 

Two Russian pipelines sprang unexplained leaks and Russia's state gas giant threatened to stop sending fuel through Ukraine, raising nerves about Europe's ability to get through winter without rationing natural gas.

Suspicious leaks on two Russian gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea **are likely the result of sabotage, officials in Denmark, Germany and Poland have warned,** heightening concerns over the vulnerability of Europe‚Äôs energy infrastructure.

Europe had filled up gas stores at a rapid clip in recent months even after Russia cut supplies -- a move European officials describe as an economic attack designed to weaken their support for Ukraine. Tuesday's developments led traders to brace for further disruption to Russian gas exports, which could drain stockpiles to precariously low levels over winter. Prices rose 20%.

[A gas leak in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor in Bornholm, Denmark \[Danish Defence Command\/Forsvaret Ritzau Scanpix\/via Reuters\]](https://preview.redd.it/uutatvilxgq91.png?width=759&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed3a8199255c886fcdd9b7aa4c09a83dd33f8a2c)

European authorities said they were investigating leaks on the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 pipes to Germany. Some officials, including the Polish prime minister, said the pipes had likely been sabotaged. **Analysts said Moscow might have damaged them to boost gas prices and hurt the European economy.**

The Kremlin said it was concerned by the news and called for an investigation.

Hours later, state gas giant Gazprom PJSC said Moscow might impose sanctions on Ukraine's national energy company, NJSC Naftogaz, if it pursues international arbitration proceedings against Gazprom. Naftogaz said this month it had filed a request at the International Court of Arbitration, alleging that Gazprom hadn't paid on time or in full for the transit of gas through Ukraine.

Gazprom said Russian sanctions would stop it from transacting with Naftogaz. That could halt the flow of Russian gas through Ukraine, the biggest remaining pipeline route. A Naftogaz spokeswoman declined to comment.

The Pulawy Separation Plant will process the purified mixed rare earth carbonate produced at Songwe Hill.

Through its ownership of Maginito ([www.maginito.com](http://www.maginito.com)), Mkango is also developing green technology opportunities in the rare earths supply chain, encompassing neodymium (NdFeB) magnet recycling as well as innovative rare earth alloy, magnet, and separation technologies. Maginito holds a 42% interest in UK rare earth (NdFeB) magnet recycler, HyProMag ([www.hypromag.com](http://www.hypromag.com)) with an option to increase its interest to 49%.

[Megathread] Why Bonds Still Have a Big Role to Play in Your Portfolio.,"We're on Reddit right now, so we're guessing that you're interested in learning more about investing. Maybe you've splurged on an underdog stock, maybe you've purchased a few memecoins or NFTs. Whatever your strategy has been thus far, we also want to make sure you're not forgetting about an element of investing that doesn't get a lot of attention: 

https://preview.redd.it/ah2aay9t5gq91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63b9d2c4d6c62996cbd0de62c7dd219af160fafe

 *(Surely you knew this was coming? You read the headline, right?)*

# Key Takeaways Before We Dive Into The Details:

* Despite a rough first half of 2022, [bonds](https://www.ishares.com/us/strategies/invest-with-bond-etfs?cid=scl:ish:up:prv:pi:re:bonds:bonds:aud:thread) can still have an important role to play in your portfolio, providing potential income, diversification, and capital preservation.
* After adjusting to the Fed‚Äôs rate hikes, short-term corporate bonds now offer roughly the same or more than dividend-paying stocks, and historically have been less-volatile investments.
* 20 years after iShares launched the first bond ETFs, investors are increasingly turning to bond ETFs as a low-cost, efficient way to customize their fixed income portfolios.

# Yes, investors felt the pain across both stocks and bonds in the first half of 2022.

The stock market posted its worst first half since 1970, while the bond market had its worst first half return on record.¬† It is truly rare for stocks and bonds to decline at the same time. Going back to 1929, there have only been three years where bonds didn‚Äôt go up when stocks went down. The most recent example was more than fifty years ago, in 1969.¬π¬†

With the bond market failing this year to balance out stock market fluctuations, many investors may be asking: *What are the pros and cons of investing in bonds right now?*

Past returns don‚Äôt guarantee future performance, but bond ETFs have historically provided ways for investors to diversify portfolios, generate income and preserve capital. Still, you may need to rethink how you're using fixed income, including the mix of bonds in your portfolio, as detailed below.

# 3 Ways Bonds Can Still Help Investors Meet Long-Term Goals 

https://preview.redd.it/yyjr1xv06gq91.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c79daad31d7ad83a0bc3816fd01225d220e0c75a

**Income** ‚Äì What‚Äôs fixed income without the income?¬† Investors can use bonds to generate income as most bonds make payments to bondholders, known as a **coupon**, on a regular schedule. With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, bonds are now providing more income.¬† For the first time in a very long time, you can get just as much income from short-term corporate bonds as you can from dividend-paying stocks. And these bonds historically come with much less volatility and lower drawdown risk (a measure of the time it takes to recoup losses) vs. their stock counterparts. 

&amp;#x200B;

[ Source: Bloomberg, as of 8\/15\/22.¬† The yield for High Dividend Equities is represented by the Index Estimated Dividend Yield of the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index while the yield for short investment grade corporates are represented by the Yield to Worst of the ICE BofA 1-5 Year Corporate Index. ](https://preview.redd.it/3x6l811c6gq91.png?width=2052&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=56fe458217b2dbc83f9e7033af9cf142d9a4c7b7)

This chart shows the difference in yields of dividend-paying stocks vs. short-term corporate bonds. First the first time in a long time, corporate bonds are yielding roughly the same or more than their equity counterparts.

Investors can get even higher levels of income, or yield, from high yield or emerging market bonds. These bonds typically come with an incremental increase in credit risk, or the likelihood a bond issuer will not make their regular payments on time.

The [iShares Broad USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (USHY)](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/291299/?cid=scl:ish:up:prv:pi:re:bonds:ushy:aud:thread) is a low-cost ETF¬†that is broader than any other high yield ETF.2 Emerging market bonds can also provide more yield, with   

[iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Market Bond ETF (EMB)](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239572/?cid=scl:ish:up:prv:pi:re:bonds:emb:aud:thread) providing exposure to over 50 countries.¬†

The [iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (USIG)](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239460/?cid=scl:ish:up:prv:pi:re:bonds:usig:aud:thread) is another investment to consider if you're looking for higher income than government bond yields but less credit risk than high yield or emerging market debt.

&amp;#x200B;

**Diversification** ‚Äì Keeping bonds in the mix of your investments can improve your overall long-term returns. As noted above, bonds historically provide investors a counterbalance to stocks, especially in down years. Historically, bond performance has tended to be good following periods of weakness in bond prices --which move in opposite direction as bond yields. Furthermore, bonds now offer more income to buffer against future price drawdowns as the market adapts to higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions.

The [iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG)](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239458/ishares-core-total-us-bond-market-etf?cid=scl:ish:up:prv:pi:re:bonds:agg:aud:thread) is among the largest bond ETFs at over $80 billion in assets under management.¬†This ETF tracks the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, a widely used benchmark for fixed-income portfolios. AGG gives you broad exposure to investment grade bonds and is a low-cost, easy way to diversify your portfolio using fixed income.

&amp;#x200B;

**Capital Preservation** ‚Äì Inflation can chip away at the value of a dollar. Bonds can act as a buffer by providing higher yield than idle cash. Investors seeking this goal should consider their time horizon, liquidity needs and risk tolerance to any loss of capital. Shorter maturity bonds tend to change in price less than longer maturity bonds and can be beneficial during periods of rising rates.¬† ¬†

The [iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV)](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/314116/?cid=scl:ish:up:prv:pi:re:bonds:sgov:aud:thread) can be a beneficial tool for capital preservation.

# Bond To Be Wild

All types of investors are recognizing that bond ETFs can help modernize fixed income portfolios. Sophisticated institutions, financial professionals and do-it-yourself individual investors all can potentially benefit from competitive performance, low costs and deep liquidity. Ultimately, your investment strategy will come down to what you feel comfortable with. Hopefully this was a helpful insight into another avenue for your financial planning.

# DISCLOSURES

**Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting** [**www.iShares.com**](https://www.ishares.com/?cid=scl:ish:up:prv:pi:re:meg:selfdrivingevtechetf:aud:thread) **or** [**www.blackrock.com**](https://www.blackrock.com/?cid=scl:ish:up:prv:pi:re:meg:selfdrivingevtechetf:aud:thread)**. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.**

**Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.**

Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher-rated securities. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency and its return and yield will fluctuate with market conditions. There is no guarantee that any fund will pay dividends.

International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets and in concentrations of single countries.

Diversification and asset allocation may not protect against market risk or loss of principal. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares of an ETF will develop or be maintained.

Transactions in shares of ETFs may result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.

This material contains general information only and does not take into account an individual's financial circumstances. This information should not be relied upon as a primary basis for an investment decision. Rather, an assessment should be made as to whether the information is appropriate in individual circumstances and consideration should be given to talking to a financial professional before making an investment decision.

This information should not be relied upon as research, investment advice, or a recommendation regarding any products, strategies, or any security in particular. This material is strictly for illustrative, educational, or informational purposes and is subject to change.

My 3 favorite long-term metrics on the app are:

1. Growth Rating- How likely a company is to grow in revenue and/or size in the next 1-2 years
2. Profitability Rating- How likely a company is to be profitable in the next few years
3. Upside Breakout - Higher scores indicate a larger chance of a sharp move upwards in price, any time within the next 1-2 years

&amp;#x200B;

My 3 favorite short-term metrics on the app are:

1. Net Institutional Flow- Tracks if institutions are buying up or selling off a stock, or options
2. Net Options Sentiment- Provides information on how long or short the market is on short duration options
3. Net Social Sentiment- Gauges positive &amp; negative sentiment from social media, as well as the difference between them

Can passive investing work during periods of high inflation?,"For the last 40 years, we've had a systematic decline of inflation and interest rates. This is partly due to increased globalization, cheap labor, a ""peace dividend"", and cheap energy. As a result, markets have steadily trended up, and while there were crashes like the dot com or the 08 GFC, eventually the Fed was always able to step in to prop up assets since inflation was low.

Before this period, during 1966 - 1982, there was massive structural inflation, and the stock market went literally nowhere for 14 years. On an inflation adjusted basis, you would have lost money. No one was recommending to dollar cost average into a broad index, because it just didn't work. The incentive for a passive strategy simply didn't exist. In contrast to today's world, after 40 years of assets grinding higher as interest rates grinded lower, the incentive for passive investing was born, and the rise of ETF's along with it.

With inflation now at 40 year highs and the Fed relentlessly raising interest rates, it seems impossible for an index ETF strategy to do well. Some might say as soon as we've dealt with inflation, things will go back to normal. Rates will go down, the market will go up, and all will be well.

The problem is, it doesn't seem that we're just going to slip back into a low inflation environment. We're dealing with deglobalization, geopolitical tensions, rampant inflation, and climate change, all of which is creating more competition for limited resources.

After Covid, the world realized it needs to onshore certain supply chains, and things like this along with Russia/Ukraine and rising tensions with China is having a deglobalizing effect, making input costs higher. In addition to these higher input costs, higher wages and Owners Equivalent Rent are proving to be sticky.

Jerome Powell said it appears we are entering ""a new normal"", referring to inflation being higher for longer, unlike the period from the last 40 years.

All of this seems to be the perfect recipe for another lost decade. One in which indexing simply does not work, and investors will be forced to become more active as the volatility of the world seeps into markets.",stocks,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xptqx0/can_passive_investing_work_during_periods_of_high/,,LuxGang,xptqx0,/r/stocks/comments/xptqx0/can_passive_investing_work_during_periods_of_high/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xptqx0/can_passive_investing_work_during_periods_of_high/,1,2022-09-27

Dark Pool Shorting Of Shares Held In Margin Accounts Is Dragging The Market Down,"Many stocks are currently being heavily shorted off-exchange (via dark pools), as is evident from calculations from [FINRA Off-Exchange Daily Short Volume Data downloads](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/browse-catalog/short-sale-volume-data) and from FINRA Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files, a.k.a. FINRA Consolidated NMS files, available [here](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/browse-catalog/short-sale-volume-data/daily-short-sale-volume-files), showing the aggregated daily short volume. The data for those stocks indicates little or no shorting occurring from the lit pool. Below are 2 such stocks, including $NVAX, for which I am showing the data from the above 2 FINRA sources consolidated in a single spreadsheet. In the below spreadsheets the Aggregated Lit Short Volume is calculated, as follows:

Aggr Lit Short Volume = Aggr Short Volume + Aggr Short Exempt Volume - Aggr Dark Short Volume

The data for these stocks clearly shows no shorting occurring in the lit exchanges and all the shorting is occurring off-exchange on shares held in dark pools.

&amp;#x200B;

Similar observations can be made for many stocks in the market, right now and it shows heavy shorting of shares for those stocks maintained in the dark pools by MMs. This gives the false impression that long term shareholders are dumping their shares, when they are actually not and paints a more gloomy picture of the market than the real situation. It also artificially increases the supply of shares as these dark pool shares can be short-sold multiple times before the short position is closed and that suppresses the stock price. Now let's look at where MMs are getting these shares from into their dark pools, as discussed in the  following paragraphs.

Per this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mojbj4/confirmed_tdameritrade_is_lending_shares_out_on/) brokers like TD Ameritrade  typically lend out shareholder shares to MMs held in a margin account, even if shareholders are not using it. This is in line with their [Margin Disclosure Document](https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/AMTD845.pdf) which states that shares held in a margin account can be sold at any time, which presumably could include short sales.

Fidelity states in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fidelityinvestments/comments/mn3dy2/hot_topic_how_fidelity_lends_shares/) ""If you do not have a debit  balance  in a margin account we will not lend your shares. If your shares  are  held in a cash account we will not lend your shares.""

[SEC bulletin on margin accounts](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_marginaccount) states the following:

&gt;**Securities Lending**  
Some  margin accounts allow the brokerage firm to lend out securities  in the  account to a third-party, at any time without notice or  compensation  to the account holder, if the investor has any outstanding  margin loan  in the account. While shares are lent out, **you may lose the voting rights**   associated with those shares. You will still receive a payment for any   dividends related to lent out shares. ¬†However, since you are not the   official holder of the shares, **the payment you receive may be taxed differently**.   Ask your brokerage firm if its margin accounts allow for securities   lending, and if so, to explain how it works and may impact the   securities in the account.

Also, there are programs like [E\*Trade Fully Paid Lending (FPL) Program](https://us.etrade.com/what-we-offer/our-accounts/fully-paid-lending) that allow brokers to lend fully paid for shareholder shares for shorting.

So,  shareholder shares held in margin accounts or those that have been lent  as part of programs like E\*Trade FPL are being used by MMs for dark pool shorting to drag the entire market down. All it takes to prevent  this manipulation is a call to your broker to ask to convert any margin  accounts that you have to cash accounts and to discontinue enrollment in  programs like E\*Trade FPL.",NVAX,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVAX/comments/xpcklc/dark_pool_shorting_of_shares_held_in_margin/,Discussion,Life_Relationship_77,xpcklc,/r/NVAX/comments/xpcklc/dark_pool_shorting_of_shares_held_in_margin/,https://www.reddit.com/r/NVAX/comments/xpcklc/dark_pool_shorting_of_shares_held_in_margin/,0,2022-09-27
Lens Upgrade Opinions,"Hey Everyone üòä Just to preface to say 1) Thank you in advance for any responses and 2) I did a search on the page for my query but a lot of responses are quite a few years old so I just wanted to inquire should there be something better on the market now. 

My Camera Gear: 
I have a Nikon D7500 with a current lens kit of 18mm-140mm for my general day to day shots and a Sigma 18-35mm. Type of photography I do is mainly landscape &amp; nature/animals. I'd do the odd aviation shoot depending when I can get to the airport or when there's an airshow on. 

What I'm Looking For: 
I was looking at getting the Nikon 18mm-300mm AND the Nikon 200mm-500mm (for the extra zoom/mm) but I understand, at least in Dublin, Ireland there is no Nikon stock at the moment because of chip shortages. I'd like a lens that can be a one for all, if possible. 

I've had camera stores recommend me the Tamron 18mm-400mm. Is this any good? When I look at photos online that people took with the lens, some backgrounds can look grainy and the subject isn't too sharp looking? I would love a lens that can give me 18mm for the likes of landscape shots and then a high enough zoom for the likes of photographing birds and planes etc. Is this possible? üòÖ Thank you again I am advance for any responses üòä",Nikon,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/xplrli/lens_upgrade_opinions/,What should I buy?,Jaeger_91,xplrli,/r/Nikon/comments/xplrli/lens_upgrade_opinions/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nikon/comments/xplrli/lens_upgrade_opinions/,0,2022-09-27
How to use money to generate more money?,"I'm very good at saving despite being on a low income. Unfortunately I think I'll always be a low earner (life is a lot harder for me than other people due to learning difficulties and ADHD but I don't qualify for PIP or anything like that). Having said that, I don't spend much and find savvy ways to get things cheaper by shopping around, cashback, discount codes etc.

I know BTL's don't generate what they used to so I want to explore other ways to use my money to make more. I already invest in the stock market a bit but this doesn't generate me much unless I sell the stocks which I don't plan on doing anytime soon (I guess I could go for more dividend stocks). I'm intrigued by P2P invest which I might explore further as the interest rates are crazy good. What other methods are worth exploring?",UKPersonalFinance,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/xpllct/how_to_use_money_to_generate_more_money/,,Friggintherigging,xpllct,/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/xpllct/how_to_use_money_to_generate_more_money/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/xpllct/how_to_use_money_to_generate_more_money/,0,2022-09-27

is F a bad stock to own in the long-term now?," I'm tempted to buy more to bring down my avg price  but I keeps dipping !

Today seemingly there was some good news that Ford is investing 700 mill in a Kentucky truck plant, creating jobs, and somehow the stock dipped 2% ? 

It seems like it's just been moving in lockstep with SPY. 

Someone has told me Ford is in a mountain of debt because of their transition to electric, but I figured they pay a good dividend and with the high demand of the f150 lightning, they're well positioned to compete with Tesla for US market, and their valuation is down to earth.

A little advice from the past,"from the ""FIRE"" sub:
https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/uo15zl/to_those_who_went_through_20082000/

""I had little investments in 2000. I was mid twenties. I remember lots of people going broke and people were looking for answers and trying to understand what the hell just happened. I read the popular book ‚Äú Rich Dad Poor Dad‚Äù by Robert Kiyosaki. It was a hit. Is Kiyosaki bat shit crazy? Absolutely. But his book ‚ÄúRich Dad Poor Dad ‚Äú is rock solid and is written so an imbecile like myself can understand it. I read it and followed it to pursue multi family housing.

In 2002 I moved into my apartment building. I was broke. I had invested everything into the business and couldn‚Äôt afford a house. A few years past and by 2007 figured I had missed my opportunity to ever buy a home for my family. Home prices didn‚Äôt make sense. There was just no way in hell home prices could go up from there (sound familiar?). I felt I missed the boat and would never be able to own a home. I was 35 years old.

2008 was like a slow motion shit show. Really bad news was released periodically yet most people held on to stock even though the bad news kept getting worse. We haven‚Äôt seen any news like that yet.

People were looking for answers and desperately searching for investment professionals to guid them. Whether it was stock news channels or internet gurus. Everyone was confused and then Lehman Brothers news hit. Then the market was officially dead. Or at least on life support.

I held on thinking I could withstand the pressure of the loss. Then about six months into 2008 I sold not far from bottom. I had never experienced anything like this and couldn‚Äôt find any mentors to guide me.

That decision probably cost me around $100k in today‚Äôs dollars.

After waiting and watching the market come back slowly, I still was suspicious, I was leery, I was scared.

It wasn‚Äôt until 2010 that I started to dip back in. I spent lots of time reading and learning from the old school pros.

That hesitation to get back in probably cost me something around another $100k.

Warren Buffet once recommended that if he didn‚Äôt have Berkshire he would have his wife put 90% of her money in index funds and 10% cash.

I wish I knew the power of index investments and buy and hold long term when I was younger. Just buying index funds and never selling until you actually need the money is the best course.

I also have learned over the years that I am an absolute moron when it comes to picking stocks. I could start a YouTube channel as a stock picker and if you shorted all my recommendations, you would become rich!

So, I invest in index funds and I don‚Äôt worry about my stock investments.

The premise of the OP insinuates that the answers here might guide them for today‚Äôs market conditions.

I will tell you from my experience, today‚Äôs situation is totally different. We are experiencing the fall of the U.S. This isn‚Äôt new, ask your parents about how Japanese cars were viewed in the 70s. We have been declining for several decades.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the U.S. is the world leader economically, technologically, militarily and on and on. But, one must consider our debt, our political division and our competitor‚Äôs (China) exponential acceleration to complete with us.

Ooh, did that sound terrible and pessimistic? It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs important to know where you are in reality. How does our situation mimic history?

The U.S. may be on the precipice of a long, slow descent of economic health. We are near the end of a long term debt cycle and have a multitude of pressures challenging our success including China, war, climate change and political divisions.

I really don‚Äôt know what the hell will happen over the next 30 years but people smarter than me are indicating that history has shown that we very well may be entering some very difficult times.

I‚Äôm very hopeful of the U.S. technology companies making great progress and innovation and saving our lazy asses. I think the U.S. is the absolute best country in the world and grateful to live here!

My retirement is 80% RE 20% stock. Of the stock funds, 30% is on the side in cash waiting for a little lower entry point. I‚Äôm not selling a lick of stock. I‚Äôm not making the mistake again of thinking that I‚Äôm smart. I‚Äôm not. In fact, I‚Äôm probably making terrible decisions with this plan.

You see, the older you get, the more life shows you how many ways it can kick you in the balls. After the pain of those lessons, you realize that you aren‚Äôt near as smart as you think you are.

As a side story, I bought a foreclosure single family home for $110k in 2014. I renovated it and just sold it for $710k. I just made over $50k a year for the last 8 years tax free. I know and have experienced the power of real estate. I trust real estate‚Äôs intrinsic value. Don‚Äôt ever question the value of human‚Äôs basic needs. Food, water, shelter. Bitcoin isn‚Äôt one of them.

I‚Äôm a total moron and have just been lucky in life. I have learned to focus on macro economics and not daily news.""",stocks,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xpnv95/a_little_advice_from_the_past/,,NumerousAbility2332,xpnv95,/r/stocks/comments/xpnv95/a_little_advice_from_the_past/,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xpnv95/a_little_advice_from_the_past/,0,2022-09-27

I am on my last year of high school,"In the past months I thought to myself what I want to do in my life? I am very good student (started to learn math and CS in university at age of 16). 
My country is west country but the stock market is not pupolar and no one is ever heard about trading there.
In the summer vaction I heard about trading from friend of mine. I started learning about it. stocks and how to trade them by watching the SPY and learned about how to make money from gap (although I was on paper account and it was only to months I think I learned this tactic).

My quistion is: which abilitiles day trader should have?
Here is what I think abkut two months of learning, and I would like if you would try to correct me:
Like chart - I like charts amd can look at thoose for hours.
Have money - I can make about 25k a year if I work as a waiter so after two years I will have decent money to work with.
Do I need to like to take high risk? - because I am not and I dont know if this can be a problem",Daytrading,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/xpvpks/i_am_on_my_last_year_of_high_school/,advice,Oz_werty,xpvpks,/r/Daytrading/comments/xpvpks/i_am_on_my_last_year_of_high_school/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/xpvpks/i_am_on_my_last_year_of_high_school/,0,2022-09-27
DD - Crime happens at night ü•ê,"I recently started a little mission to look at the price action for AMC and make correlations with real events, to get a better understanding at what may be happening behind the scenes.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my coworkers told me a few months back that ever since around the AMC/GME saga last January, day trading and swing trading has gotten MUCH more difficult... I decided to take a peek and see if anything changed and I stumbled on something pretty neat (or scary).

&amp;#x200B;

What I did was look at activity during PM/AM and activity during market open.

&amp;#x200B;

I will explain my process at the end so you can perform the exact same analysis on any security of your choosing for your own knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

I took the data for AMC dating back to 2020 and split the movements from market close -&gt; market open and market open -&gt; market close.  Basically what this means is, I looked at close price vs open price and compared them to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

For the following example, if I invested 1 dollar into AMC right when the market opened every single day and sold right at the closing bell, then did that every single day for two years, compounding gains and losses, I would right now be sitting at 5 cents.

If I did the exact same thing, but invested 1 dollar right at market close then sold right at the opening bell, I would be the proud owner of 24.5 dollars!

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a graphical representation:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/43hnlpr4fhq91.png?width=1055&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=821be7309d3548ee46ad59335377609d0fe2559e

I can't even see what is happening during the day, it's that small!  Let's move it over to the secondary axis for a clearer picture.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rz0voh9gfhq91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec0b94b99468c7ccfb47a3a777c197fca07bdf46

Well isn't that interesting... the daily price drops all but stopped right during the January sneeze!

On top of that, price started declining during the night time right after the June sneeze!  This graphically shows that all of the price f@#\*ery is happening overnight while retail in large cannot trade.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see if the same is true for GME...

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/877fbufufhq91.png?width=1068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00fc2830a5b430e949eb662478edb09398ddfaaf

Looks to me like GME got the nighttime price action muted right around the march 2021 timeframe... what happened in March 2021?  The March sneeze!

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at a broader market example.. the SPY

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j5lac0y5ghq91.png?width=966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=267642e2cb1c11c8bec015c56af1d1f182ed7e66

By inspecting the SPY chart, it appears that meme stocks had little to no effect on overnight vs daytime movement... but there is an interesting reversal that happens on december 15th in this chart... let's see what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cpf12kfdghq91.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ad3e6f66afdd9104884c9bb4394b5be6fd7035a

&amp;#x200B;

Since the SPY overnight price action is largely affected by the printing of money (or so it appears), let's look at a smaller index that both of our beloved 'meme' stocks have sat for at least some time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sck8svfmghq91.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f3624204346609a5ff7ffc20fb446ba8b98076f

This is the Russell 2000 ETF.  This is the ETF in which many retail day and swing traders operate.  These traders also trade when the market is OPEN.  As you can see, the price action makes a sharp reversal around the Jan 2021 sneeze timeframe and continues that trend to this day.  

&amp;#x200B;

My coworker telling me that trading became hard after the AMC/GME saga appears to have truth to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the process in case you want to do it for yourself:

1) Search the stock you want on yahoo finance  
2) click historical data and download to csv  
3) open CSV and do Close/Open and Open/Close formulas.  
4) plot the data

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know what your thoughts are on the matter and if there's any validity to my claim that crime happens overnight.

Please avoid ordering from Razer.com at all costs.,"Speaking as a Razer supporter who has been purchasing Razer products for over 6 years. The total I have spent on products is probably around $5000 USD.

In the previous years, I lived in Asia and had no problems with Razer but recently moved to Europe. I decided to order a Razer Iskur. If you check the market price of a Razer Iskur it is 400 pounds. On the Razer website at the time (2nd September 2022) It raised the price to 450 pounds for an Iskur + Free Mouse offer, and was in stock and ready to purchase. I fell victim as a found out shortly after that I had not gotten any promotion, but was tricked. Let me explain  


Market price of Iskur: 400 pounds  
Discounted price of Razer Viper Ultimate at the time: 48 pounds on Amazon  


Total price paid in cart: 448 pounds  


You may think that I got a deal by getting a Razer Viper Ultimate for 48 pounds but not only was it not ""free"" as advertised, it was on mass sale for 48 pounds on amazon which said ""limited offer, 4 hours remaining."" I checked amazon 4 days later and the offer was still standing. I paid 448 pounds for 448 pounds worth of items. There was no ""free"" mouse or promotion.  


The biggest issue with my order was that it claimed to be in stock and available and the website policy states that it will have orders delivered in 5-7 business days. 8 days had passed and I had no update from customer support despite following up on the situation multiple times. I was told to wait ""24-48 hours"" 3 times. I did not agree to this delay in shipment and was told my customer support that the Iskur was out of stock at the warehouse, and I would have to wait longer. I was denied a refund even though they had not shipped my order out yet.

&amp;#x200B;

It was on the 21st of September after 19 days did the chair arrive, but I could not deny the shipment as I was not informed of when it would arrive. Before the chair arrived, I was also contacted by FedEx telling me I would have to pay 60 pounds of VAT+Shipping handling fee. VAT+Shipping handling fee was already paid for inside my Razer invoice, and when I went to contact support they told me that I had to pay for it even though I had already paid the amount to Razer in my order.

On the 9th of September, my order had finally started being shipped out, and Daryll from customer support said on record that I would receive a 15% partial refund sent back to my account for the delay. I agreed and he said that it would be sent back to my account the moment my order had arrived, but on the 21st I did not receive any funds and was compensated.   


On the 24th of September, I followed up on the matter and received a call from the ""VIP response team"", who told me that I would only get a 5% laptop discount code and will not be receiving my 15% partial refund. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the 26th of September, I received a call from 2AM from Fame L from ""VIP customer support"". He told me on the call that he already tried to process my refund but Razer denied him the transaction and told me he would get back in 24 hours but it has now been 2 days with no response.

&amp;#x200B;

So today on the 28th I received another call but this time from Michael Angelo and he said the same thing and said I would only receive a measely discount code and that was their final resort.  


1. If your product out of stock don't advertise it on your website saying it is in stock and ready to order.
2. Customer support did absolutely nothing and ignored my follow ups as I did not receive any responses.
3. Dirty business strategy conducted by Razer. Raising prices or having fake offers.
4. Razer held my money without sending out my product and lied about it being in stock on the website, and also had FedEx contact me to even pay for taxes+shipping fee that I was already charged for on the website.
5. It was finally agreed by Daryll that I would be receiving 15% partial compensation and Razer lied and turned on it.
6. I was denied a refund when my product was not even shipped out yet. This is a blatant scam and my money was unlawfully held.

BOOHOO INTERIM RESULTS ‚Äì WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?," 

#### Key points:

* Boohoo is scheduled to post its interim results Wednesday
* The online fashion retailer‚Äôs shares are down significantly this year
* Current headwinds do not suggest any surprises

Boohoo (LON: BOO) is scheduled to post its [interim results](https://www.boohooplc.com/investors/financial-calendar) on Wednesday, September 28, and with its share price down 69% in 2022, and over 85% in the last 12 months, investors will be hoping for a hint of positive news. On Tuesday the online fashion retailer announced that its new Chief Financial Officer, Shaun McCabe, will take up his new role on October 2, 2022.

However, investor focus is almost certainly on tomorrow‚Äôs scheduled release. Unfortunately, the current economic environment doesn‚Äôt indicate there will be much to cheer for.

## INFLATION

As we all know, the primary driver of a consumer spending decline, inflation, has surged this year. While overall, it eased slightly in the latest reading ‚Äî it was primarily driven by a decrease in energy prices. Food and apparel inflation both rose.

This will have, of course, impacted consumers. For example, online fashion retail competitor ASOS said, in a trading update for the year ended August 31, that it saw ‚Äúgood growth in June and July,‚Äù but sales in August were ‚Äúweaker than anticipated‚Äù due to the ‚Äúimpact of accelerating inflationary pressures on consumers and a slow start to Autumn/Winter shopping.‚Äù

ASOS also said it remains cautious about the outlook. Given Boohoo is in the same boat, it would be no surprise to read similar comments. 

One of the metrics that can be used to assess recent demand for a product or company is Google Search Trends.

Even though there hasn‚Äôt been a dramatic decline in search interest for Boohoo itself (other than a fall over Christmas 2021 as pandemic restrictions significantly eased), it has edged lower in recent years.

It currently sits at 32, compared to 46 in September 2021 and 63 in September 2019 (a value of 100 represents peak popularity).

However, while that suggests current demand has been pressured, we also need to look at data so far this year as a representation of how Boohoo sales may have performed. Looking at the chart, we can see search interest was somewhat stable at the beginning of the year but began to dip in July ‚Äî suggesting a similar path to ASOS sales.

Elsewhere, we can also see search interest in other Boohoo-owned brands, such as Debenhams, Burton and PrettyLittleThing, has declined in recent months, implying that inflation is weighing heavy on demand overall.

## SHORT SELLERS

Although it has not impacted how the business has performed (but certainly an indication of expectations), it is interesting to note that Boohoo, according to Short Tracker, is the most shorted London-listed stock.

The short position is said to now be 9.7% of the share issuance, up from the [8.6% reported earlier this month](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/boohoo-we-should-go-long-with-citadel-short-with-the-market/). Marble Bar Asset Management LLP and CapeView Capital LLP have the largest short positions in Boohoo at 2.15% and 1.87%, respectively. The fact it is still the most shorted London-listed stock means that despite the significant downside already, investors see Boohoo shares continuing their decline. In addition, at the end of August, Barclays cut its price target on Boohoo shares to 37p from 45p, maintaining an Underweight rating.

However, those positions go against US hedge fund Citadel, which has built a 5% stake in the online fashion retailer.

## BOTTOM LINE

Overall, current economic headwinds suggest there won‚Äôt be any upside surprises in its interim results, and the expectation is for it to be in line with guidance, if not slightly below. Although investors seem to be anticipating a continued fall in Boohoo‚Äôs share price, so a miss cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the overall focus will be on its future and the company‚Äôs expectations.",asktraders12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktraders12/comments/xpgfmz/boohoo_interim_results_what_can_we_expect/,,Asktraders178,xpgfmz,/r/asktraders12/comments/xpgfmz/boohoo_interim_results_what_can_we_expect/,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktraders12/comments/xpgfmz/boohoo_interim_results_what_can_we_expect/,0,2022-09-27

So Many Questions // An Excercise in Informational Awareness and Theoretical Probability in Activist Investor Decision Making Processes and Market Dynamics,"The following is a comment I just made in response to a question regarding ""Why did RC sell at that time?"", followed by a list of questions I followed up with.

I encourage anyone interested in this conversation to respond to specific questions listed here, in the comments section, by referring to the number associated with the question.

I am also interested in users adding questions in the comments and encourage open, constructive, and respectful discussion.

Feel free to participate, or let the post die if you do not find this conversation of relevant value.

----

Premise:

It's all up to speculation as to why that was the time and price point at which he chose to divest, but I personally believe that RC Ventures' intervention likely saved BBBY and set them on a completely different course, that RC, his investors in GME, and investors in BBBY will ultimately benefit from.

I believe it shifted market dynamics in the favor of both companies with regard to the shorts trying to put them out of business.

Questions:

1. Did he sell because he didn't want to run the price further while still being in?  Potentially bringing in fomo investors at a higher price than he thought they should get in at, at that time?

2. Did he finish his work, and reclaim capital to use again in a similar effort in a different company?

3. Did he ""give up"", ""cut and run"", despite achieving all the goals set forth in his original letter?

4. Were there forces, we are not aware of, who would have benefitted from him keeping his stake in the company at that time?

5. Why would Jim Cramer so publicly and repeatedly praise his sale, as having ""such guts""?

6. Does RC gain from Jim Cramer's praise? Or is Cramer's praise a continuation of the long term troll against RC, who he publicly and repeatedly and quite sarcastically, has referred to as his ""best friend""?

7. Why has RC refused to go on Mad Money for the last two years, despite this praise?

8. Is Jim Cramer's praise an obvious ploy to continue his attempt to turn investors against RC?

9. What conflicts of interest may arise by maintaining his stake?

10. Did RC have a net benefit to his business and reputation because of the sale?

11. Who is Jake Freeman, and why did he so publicly interact with r/BBBY and Twitter regarding his advice, despite having no power over the company decisions?

12. Why was Jake Freeman so praised for his trade across the entire financial media landscape, despite his public statement in this subreddit that he would hold his shares long?

13. Why did the price continue to go up after RC sold?

14. How does GME benefit in the market from a retooled, and not-going-bankrupt-anymore BBBY?

15. Is retail basket theory real?  Are basket swaps an important part of concealing over leveraged short positions in so called ""dying brick and mortar"" companies?

16. Has RC had any issue making highly public and highly critical statements of the previous BBBY management and short sellers?

17. Why would a very young Ben Rozenweig accept the board directorship? What implications on his future career and legacy does a success or failure at BBBY have for him?

18. Who benefits from RC's current silence?

19. Who benefits from associating him with suicide of the CFO?

20. Why would a CFO commit suicide two days after a company update that announces drastic strategy changes and revised financial outlook? (I have rephrased this question for the purposes of the exercise in this post, and it should not be construed as being in direct reference to the prior CFO of BBBY.  Please keep comments civil and respectful.)

21. Does the timing of RC's purchase of BBBY and sale of BBBY have an affect on larger market dynamics affecting shorted retail stocks?

22. Had RC been planning his exit to be at that time or was it spontaneous?

23. How does Amazon's consolidation of eCommerce factor into this?

24. Did Jeff Bezos start his career in the Hedge Fund Industry and subsequently never encounter any short pressure from said industry?

25. What similarities exist between Chewy and buy buy Baby from a business standpoint?

26. What private equity interests are at play?

27. Does BBBY have value in the world beyond the value placed on it by the public markets?

28. Why is the media so negative on BBBY now yet was full of so much praise for Mark Tritton?

29. What happened to the stock price after 2018 when new interests took a stake in the company and employed an entirely new management team, that is no longer there?

30. Why was BBBY selling NFL branded fidget spinners, which are now being liquidated along with an incredible amount of non brand name junk that they purchased?

31. Why did the previous CFO go ahead with a Billion dollars of stock buy backs despite it's negative affect on the company's cash position?

32. Why did they invest so heavily into in-house brands, that have no brand awareness to the public, and expect them to sell?

33. Why didn't BBBY lean into eCommerce earlier?

34. Does buy buy Baby have any direct competition in the marketplace at large?

35. Who benefits from BBBY heading toward bankruptcy despite owning such a valuable asset as buy buy Baby?

36. What happens to company IP and the IP of their assets if they do go bankrupt?

37. What affect on short positions is there when a company goes bankrupt?

38. Do they have to account for synthetic shares and naked shorting if that happens?

39. What happens to other overly shorted retail basket stocks when one of them, unexpectedly does not follow their course toward bankruptcy?

Again, why was BBBY selling NFL branded fidget spinners?

A significant global uranium supply deficit explained - it's like the USA and Saudi Arabia not producing oil anymore.,"Hi everyone,

Most of the investors when talking about commodities are used to hear about Gold, Copper, Oil, Gas, ...

Uranium on the other hand is a less known commodity.

The global uranium supply and demand is in a serious deficit and the uranium price today is still too low to incentives enough new production in the LT to get the global uranium supply and demand back in equilibrium.

Today the uranium spotprice is \~48.50 USD/lb, while a price of 80 USD/lb is needed (based on the global production cost curve versus the global annual uranium consumption)

The demand for uranium is also growing year afer year due to the global nuclear reactor fleet increase (China, India, ...) even Japan now wants to build new reactors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why is there a global deficit (part 1 and part 2)?**

The uranium sector was in a long bear market since 2011 (Fukushima). By consequence not enough investments were made in the sector to get new uranium production ready on time to replace uranium mines that are getting depleted now and in the coming years. In the meantime the uranium demand is increasing year after year. =&gt; **deficit part1**

Since 2022 a additional supply problem occured, namely a shift from underfeeding (=secondary uranium supply) to overfeeding (secondary uranium demand) due to a loss of enrichment capacity. A problem that  will take many years to solve. =&gt; **deficit part2**

&amp;#x200B;

The impact of the shift from underfeeding to overfeeding will lead to:

\- an additional supply gap of \~30 million ponds in 2022 (\~20 million lbs from underfeeding gone + \~10 million lbs (start of overfeeding)) (imo and Cameco saying in May 2022 that underfeeding was already gone!)

\- an additional supply gap of \~50 million pounds in 2023 (\~20 million lbs from underfeeding gone + \~30 million lbs (overfeeding in full speed))   (based on experts from the nuclear fuel cycle)

As a comparison, the global primary uranium supply in 2022 is \~135,000,000lb

&amp;#x200B;

Before the shift from underfeeding to overfeeding, TradeTech predicted a 200 million lbs uranium demand compared to only 135 million lbs of total global uranium production in 2022 + 20 million secondary supply from underfeeding, which already led to an annual global uranium deficit of \~45 million lb in 2022

**Adding the additional annual deficit of \~30 Mlbs (part 2) from the shift to this \~45 Mlbs deficit (part 1) results in a total global supply deficit   of \~75 million lbs in 2022**

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my estimates the global uranium production in 2023 could increase by 20 million pounds (If everything goes according to all the production plans. But in reality it never goes smoothly, so it will probably be  less than 20 million pounds). But ok, let's pretend a 20 million pounds increase of global uranium production in 2023, meaning a total global production of \~155 million pounds in 2023.

200 million lbs uranium demand compared to only 135 + 20 million lbs  uranium production in 2023 + 20 million secondary supply from  underfeeding that will not exist in 2023, which would have led to an   annual global uranium deficit of \~25 million lb in 2023

**Adding the additional annual deficit of \~50 Mlbs (part 2) from the shift to this \~25 Mlbs deficit (part 1) again results in a total global supply  deficit of \~75 million lbs in 2023**

&amp;#x200B;

Important to note here is that the estimated global production increase of 20 million lb in 2023 is only possible if the uranium price goes  significantly higher than the \~48.50 USD/lb today. Uranium miners will not start or restart production to sell uranium at a loss. Period!

&amp;#x200B;

**What is a global annual 75 million uranium deficit?**

The global annual uranium supply deficit in 2022 is \~75Mlbs (45+30) and again \~75Mlbs (25+50) in 2023 compared to a annual 200Mlbs uranium consumption. So this 75Mlbs deficit is a 37.50% shortage for global  consumption + no spare enrichment.

**It‚Äôs like having the 2 biggest oil producing countries (USA and Saudi Arabia) not producing oil anymore!**

Today the uranium spotprice is at \~48.50USD/lb, while US miners need a sell price well above 60USD/lb and Cameco said in May: ‚Äùto restart our US assets we need at least 80USD/lb‚Äù

Note: High season (September/October till February/March) in the uranium sector is about to start.

&amp;#x200B;

If interested:

a) **Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN on the TSX and SRUUF on US stock exchange) is an investment in  physica uranium (no  uranium on paper!) without being exposed to the   mining risks

U.UN share price at 15.75 CAD/share represents an uranium price of \~46.00USD/lb.

17.00 CAD/share represents an uranium price of \~49USD/lb.

18.50 CAD/sh would represent an uranium price of only \~54USD/lb.

21.50 CAD/sh would represent an uranium price of only \~63USD/lb.

25.00 CAD/sh would represent an uranium price of only \~73USD/lb.

b) **Yellow Cake** (YCA on London stock exchange) is also an investment in physica uranium without being exposed to the mining risks

Yellow Cake (421 GBp) still trading at a discount over NAV of \~8.5%

c) **Sprott Uranium Miners** etf (URNM etf): well diversified 100% uranium sector etf

d) Individuel uranium company stocks (Cameco, Kazatomprom, Paladin Energy, Global Atomic, UR-energy, Denison Mines, ...)

Someone was intentionally attempting to discredit the Meme Traded Bible or unintentionally discredit it (my response to them saying I was doing something illegal is posted here for your review ‚Äî I won‚Äôt say their name),"No. You are under informed. 

Edit:

For example‚Ä¶Right now I am coordinating a similar movement ‚Äúbuying union‚Äù for APE with AA. You can miss out or stay on Reddit listening to non-credible people. With that said, thanks for being honest. I am sure it comes off that way, because my message is on Reddit along side weirdos, but please know collective stock buying like collective bargaining is legal. For example RC (Ryan Cohen) advertises his buying plays in advance to members of his hedge fund. In fact he sent our messages to members of his investment pool before and after he sold. You likely were not on that distribution list, just like many other who are now mad at him and claiming he betrayed our movement. No he did not. He published his moves to people in his circle. So what I am doing is all RC does ‚Äî but without the hedgefund restrictions because I do not buy for you and APE WORLD ‚Äî I just ‚Äústock screen‚Äù and offer specific advice on when to buy and sale. I can legally do it because we are a not for profit federal IRS recognized investment club and retirement advice group 501(c)4. 

By the way RC is the one who put me on the game. God bless you bro or sis.

Edit: 
Also, I encourage you to go to theJSF.club the website looks trash ‚Äî remember I operate a not for profit but the content is good. If I was you, and I wanted to learn options trading or how to buy and sell with 1000000 other retail I investors I would start there. Also ask me anything because I here to ensure millennial investors can retire in 10 years, but we do not discriminate on the I generation, or boomers. But again ask me anything, that is what my foundation pays me to do. Answer questions on forums like this and for workshop attendees. 

Edit:

Lastly, in reference to you discrediting my Amazon Kindle published book please learn this: all content is reviewed by Amazon.com. Jeff Bezos is a billionaire. So I doubt he is going to publish my writing if they were as you said ‚Äúillegal‚Äù and risk getting suited for me. The point is it is legal, and you now know that. The question is will you decide to win with us or be like shills and naysayers. Not saying you are. Just communicating frankly. That is how I got to this place in life. Honestly. Again, thanks for your opinions. Opinions matter, and I would not be here with the OPINIONS OF OUR retail investors crew ‚Äî APE WORLD !

You all are the one buying the most. I just have maybe $100k in the stock market right now, so my MAIN point is you and all the other investors on Reddit have the true power. Many just don‚Äôt know how collective buying allows the price action to fly high fast, but I am trying to tell you. That way you can be informed. 

Lastly, just read the book and judge for yourself (once it‚Äôs cleared for sale) instead of opposing my truth as if you read the book already. If the book is trash, just do a book review‚Äî and say your opinions. That is what book reviews are for.

On the real though‚Äî just talking like a millennial‚Äî so I hope my words (do not offend) are not to rough for you. If they do offend I apologize in advance. 


Also here is free game: Get some ape too. Those who follow my lead will be buying that soon too, but if you buy now you will be ahead of our whole crew. I have not released that information formally. And I have not written that book yet. Drama with my wife right now, but once me and AA are on the same page ‚Äî look for that John Saunders book too. So I guess it‚Äôs sort of like you have ‚Äúinsider‚Äù information now ‚Äî yes still legal.",OptionsMillionaire,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OptionsMillionaire/comments/xpw9y0/someone_was_intentionally_attempting_to_discredit/,,ZealousidealFlow2523,xpw9y0,/r/OptionsMillionaire/comments/xpw9y0/someone_was_intentionally_attempting_to_discredit/,https://www.reddit.com/r/OptionsMillionaire/comments/xpw9y0/someone_was_intentionally_attempting_to_discredit/,0,2022-09-27

"9-27-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","As exciting as it is to live through these ‚Äúonce in life time moments‚Äù they are getting quite old. Today we just closed our 6th red day in a row‚Ä¶ This is something that has not happened since the Feb 2020 covid crash which saw 7 red days in a row and dropped 15.7% over that time period. 

SPY currently has fallen 7.4% over 6 days now. Kinda crazy to think we have had 6 red days in a row for the first time in 2.5 years yet we have only fallen half the distance that the covid crash saw. However, since August 16th (30 trading days) we have seen a total drop of 16.5%... falling just a few % short of the March 29th to May 20th 17.7% sell off over 38 days before we finally saw a meaningful bounce. With SPY officially putting a new low of year in here, the VIX making a new higher high (breaking the downward trend started in January) its hard to be bullish here especially with from what I have seen besides the CPI -4.35% red day I haven‚Äôt felt ‚Äúcapitulation‚Äù or that fear pumping scary that the bottoms never coming sell off. 

CNBC on Friday mentioned that historically this is the ‚Äúworst week of the year for stocks‚Äù with the weekly only being down -1.24% total currently‚Ä¶ and some -5% to -6% red weeks to compete with‚Ä¶ I wonder how this week is going to finish out.

Looking at SPY weekly here we have the black downward channel still intact, we have a blue falling wedge forming and we also have a red falling wedge forming inside of that falling wedge. 

The one thing that I am really seeing here though is that the red horizontal channel with resistance at 370.6 was broken underneath on September 23rd and we have now rejected that resistance 3 days in a row and made a new lower low each day. I am actually a little surprised that when we made a new official low for the year that we didn‚Äôt just see a face melting dump. We consolidated for almost 3 hours around that 362 level. I do wonder if we are about to see that level broken and see the 350s for the first time since November 2020 tomorrow. Despite the now 6 red days in a row‚Ä¶ I have a hard time being bullish while SPY rejects 370 and make a new low for the last 11 days straight.

Taking a look at futures we are seeing a fairly similar pattern with the black bear channel and the blue falling wedge. I have highlighted two arrows (in blue) where we could be at. Looking at the trend of two days of sell candles followed by a gravestone doji we could be starting a two day bigger sell off tomorrow. Looking at trends generally when a gravestone doji like todays candle pops up on a downward sell off it usually leads to a continuation not a reversal. I do suspect further downside. I would be bearish based off futures as long as we are making lower lows, closing lower lows and as long as we hold under 3770. 

Key support- 3635 -&gt; 3615 (blue support) -&gt; 3590 -&gt; 3545

Key resistance- 3670 -&gt; 3706 (blue resistance) -&gt; 3770

Looking at apple this morning once again‚Ä¶ which has been trend for the last week‚Ä¶ we have seen nothing but strength from apple and tech overall. Today however, we did see weakness in the tech side of things with the exception of Apple, Tesla and Nvidia. However despite an early morning breakout attempt we saw weakness end of day and did see apple even flash red momentarily. With a break of that potential V bottom support we should be looking at further downside. 

I was as I called out yesterday (before VIX rocketed and SPY made a new lower low) that we would see a potential breakout with a inverse head and shoulders. AS of now that is technically still intact, however, if Apple loses 149.2 that will negate the pattern. With Apple attempting to break out, closing its 4th doji daily candle in a row, and failing to close over its daily 8ema 3 days in a row I would suspect downside to come. 

The thing I am waiting for now that SPY put in a new low is for the tech sell off. SPY is at the 75% retracement of its 2022 bear channel with apple still holding at 50% retracement along with Tesla. Tech is in far better shape then the general stock market and SPY. We have seen a NYSE driven sell off for the last week. The reason in my opinion we haven‚Äôt hit capitulation and we haven‚Äôt been seeing 3-4%+ sell offs is because people have not abandoned their tech positions yet. If and when tech finally loses support and loses its buy pressure that is when SPY will put the bottom in and that is when we see the worse week in market history play out. As long as Apple and tech in general hold semi bullish‚Ä¶ this is likely to be a slow burn sell off. 

Key supports- 150.7 -&gt; 149.3 -&gt; 147.1

Key resistance- 152.4 -&gt; 154.5

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rabr1ak0bhq91.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=421f0e076579dbbf7cccfc8a56f8f154fa23a45e

Tesla is another one that I was expecting could see a bigger breakout despite a looming downward pattern. With the rejection at daily 8ema and rejecting/ closing below 283.9. I suspect with that big 4 day sell off last week followed by now a 2 day dead cat bounce is about to see its next leg down. Which if Tesla truly is on its next leg down here that means tech could be the catalyst of doom for SPY and the markets. 

Tesla actually had a ton of movement today with a total of $11.16. Being up almost 4.5% and down the lowest I saw a +0.7% closing up 2.51% may seem like a victory for the tesla bulls, however, to me this showed weakness. I will be keeping an eye on that 283.8 resistance tomorrow. As long as Tesla holds below that I am bearish. Once and If we break through 270.3 support I think that will trigger that bigger sell off I was alluding to. 

Support- 270.3 -&gt; 264.4 (50% retracement/ black falling wedge support) 

Resistance- 283.8 (falling wedge resistance) -&gt; 292

&amp;#x200B;

Just when I finally said it was time to give up on the VIX and it was no longer pertinent to my everyday trading‚Ä¶ it goes and makes itself important again. Today actually was an extreme bearish day overall technical wise. Not only did SPY put in a new lower low for the year we saw the VIX break its black dotted bear channel resistance line that dates back to January 24th 2022. This means the trend of the VIX continuously making lower lows has been broken. The VIX is now pushing higher and higher. Many people have been saying true bottom is not in until we see the VIX hit 40-50‚Ä¶ I am not saying that is what is going to happen but this is the highest the VIX has been since the June 16th previous low. The question now is will the VIX attempt to make a 52week high (38.94) tomorrow, or is the VIX reaching max fear levels and much like January, March, May and June when the VIX breached 33.7 the top was in.

I am pretty indifferent here. On one hand historically speaking for 2022 making a new low on SPY, and VIX breaking 33.7 is a time that we should consider going long on some Calls. However, I haven‚Äôt really seen that big flip back to bullish sentiment, and we have not seen tech catch up (more like drop down) to the sell of intensity that SPY is experiencing. 

The next few days are going to be interesting on SPY and you can expect with the VIX over 32 again for high volatility and unpredictability. 

10% challenge-

You know honestly not my best day today‚Ä¶ I had some 1dte and 3dte calls that were hella red overnight that I swung. Was able to close the 3dte naturally for a nice win at open and then a quick average down at open got me to breakeven on the 1dte calls. 

From there it was downhill for a little while. I was still under the impression that we were going to be seeing a green close today and I was also under the impression that the bottom was in and that we were going to take 370 out finally. I was very wrong. Thankfully EOD I was able to get on board and able to close out a decent week day. 

This is one of those days where being TOO biased to start the days and being ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù than the markets can really hurt you. The best thing I did today was having hard stop loss price targets for my calls. I was able to recognize I COULD be wrong and that if I WAS wrong it was time to GTFO before a manageable loser became an unmanageable loser. 

I am very indifferent where markets are going to go from here. On one hand I really do think we could see the 340s-350s this week and on the other hand we are hitting some extreme levels on SPY and the VIX and we very well could have just put the bottom in. I really don‚Äôt know where to go from here‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs why when in doubt we don‚Äôt swing and why for the most part I recommend intraday plays. 

Overall I think as long as tech holds support (Apple closing over 149.2 and Tesla over 270.1) it is hard for me to be full bear. But in a market as volatile and vulnerable as now anything can happen overnight.

DD - Crime happens overnight!," I recently started a little mission to look at the price action for GME and make correlations with real events, to get a better understanding at what may be happening behind the scenes.

One of my coworkers told me a few months back that ever since around the GME saga last January, day trading and swing trading has gotten MUCH more difficult... I decided to take a peek and see if anything changed and I stumbled on something pretty neat (or scary).

What I did was look at activity during PM/AM and activity during market open.

I will explain my process at the end so you can perform the exact same analysis on any security of your choosing for your own knowledge.

I took the data for GME dating back to 2020 and split the movements from market close -&gt; market open and market open -&gt; market close. Basically what this means is, I looked at close price vs open price and compared them to each other.

For the following example, if I invested 1 dollar into GME right when the market opened every single day and sold right at the closing bell, then did that every single day for two years, compounding gains and losses, I would right now be sitting at 41 cents.

If I did the exact same thing, but invested 1 dollar right at market close then sold right at the opening bell, I would be the proud owner of 23.4 dollars!

Here is a graphical representation:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4p720w3zjhq91.png?width=971&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f3d18bb967e0e8c2e48cd023fcfb360c7b393a8

I can't even see what is happening during the day, it's that small! Let's move it over to the secondary axis for a clearer picture.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6fiphl22khq91.png?width=1072&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47bbdb2ff39d41b58b86d32d75c0feeb51945459

Well isn't that interesting... the daily price drops all but stopped right after the January sneeze!

On top of that, price started declining during the night time right after the March sneeze! This graphically shows that all of the price f@#\*ery is happening overnight while retail in large cannot trade.  On top of that, over the past several months, the daytime price is RISING while the overnight price is SHARPLY FALLING.  This proves that the negative GME price action is occurring while retail CANNOT trade.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let's see if the same is true for our other friendly 'meme' stock...

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0qusyczckhq91.png?width=1179&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef3b4acf8581295769421682ea29b4a8baaea009

Yikes... looks like they started getting laddered down at the beginning of June, while the daily action stayed mostly flat.  I wonder what happened in June...

&amp;#x200B;

Let's now look at a broader market example.. the SPY

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xw8k0nntkhq91.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d30037bc568b9e04589f73ab1e4fa84a36d2460

By inspecting the SPY chart, it appears that meme stocks had little to no effect on overnight vs daytime movement... but there is an interesting reversal that happens on December 15th in this chart... let's see what it is.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h4rj8u40lhq91.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=621ede19db20365f7d552d156a9d2cf60f679c25

Since the SPY overnight price action is largely affected by the printing of money (or so it appears), let's look at a smaller index where GME sat for a period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wj3l0rm4lhq91.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54f2970d321ec2b7de53bea50343d55f9fc129df

&amp;#x200B;

This is the Russell 2000 ETF. This is the ETF in which many retail day and swing traders operate. These traders also trade when the market is OPEN. As you can see, the price action makes a sharp reversal around the Jan 2021 sneeze timeframe and continues that trend to this day.

My coworker telling me that trading became hard after the GME saga appears to have truth to it.

Here is the process in case you want to do it for yourself:

1. Search the stock you want on yahoo finance
2. click historical data and download to csv
3. open CSV and do Close/Open and Open/Close formulas.
4. plot the data

Please let me know what your thoughts are on the matter and if there's any validity to my claim that crime happens overnight. Retail traders are kicking butt during the day and getting robbed when the exchanges are turned off.

"S&amp;P 500 Will See 3000-3400 Later this Year, Morgan Stanley's Wilson Warns Again","With the Fed removing ""any remaining doubts about its commitment"" to strongly tackle extremely high inflation, Morgan Stanley's top equity strategist Michael Wilson is increasingly confident in his prediction that U.S. stocks are yet to hit the real bottom.

The strategist sees both stocks and bonds taking ""another leg lower"" in response to the growth trajectory in earnings and the economy, as well as the strong dollar.

""While hard to predict such ""events,"" the conditions are in place for one, which would help accelerate the end to this bear market,"" Wilson told clients in a note.

Wilson also sees an ""untenable situation for risk assets"" for risk assets given the soaring U.S. dollar, which could prompt ""a financial or economic crisis, or both."" Morgan Stanley strategists have a $118 price target on the dollar index (DXY), which suggests more upside.

""On a year over year basis, the DXY is now up 21% and still rising. Based on our analysis that every 1% change in the DXY has around a -0.5% impact on S&amp;P 500 earnings, 4Q S&amp;P 500 earnings will face an approximate 10% headwind to growth all else equal,"" the strategist added.

Morgan Stanley's top strategist also sees accelerating negative earnings revision in the next 1-2 months, a development that should facilitate the next log lower in stocks.

""We remain highly convicted in our view that the bear market in stocks will not be over until the S&amp;P 500 reaches the range of our Base and Bear case tactical targets ‚Äì i.e.,3000-3400, later this fall,"" Wilson concluded.

Is F a bad stock to own in the long-term?,"

I'm tempted to buy more to bring down my avg price  but it keeps dipping !

Today seemingly there was some good news that Ford is investing 700 mill in a Kentucky truck plant, creating jobs, and somehow the stock dipped 2% ? 

It seems like it's just been moving in lockstep with SPY. 

Someone has told me Ford is in a mountain of debt because of their transition to electric, but cant read a balance sheet. 

I figured they pay a good dividend and with the high demand of the f150 lightning, they're well positioned to compete with Tesla for US market, and their valuation is down to earth.

$APRN - Some Market Observations,"Not financial advise, merely observations. It's been awhile, life's been busy, but I won a best ball golf tournament, which was cool because I'm ass at golf.

Update on my Ortex tracking, closing prices, versus shares short:

https://preview.redd.it/we2ydaap5mq91.png?width=441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80a8bf5f3dfc4da2961619b629eeb42f5221ea7b

I continue to see a bullish pattern as the PIPE is being finalized the high short interest is still fantastic news and the lower the share price the greater the buyback. Even with the short term bull run these last two days, I still believe Sanberg will execute on his plan. Why?

Form 8-K Filing:

&gt;On September¬†20, 2022, Peter Faricy notified Blue Apron Holdings,¬†Inc. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) of his decision to resign from the Company‚Äôs Board of Directors (the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù), effective October¬†15, 2022. Mr.¬†Faricy will also resign as a member of the Company‚Äôs Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. His resignation is not the result of any dispute or disagreement with the Company, the Company‚Äôs management or the Board on any matter relating to the operations, policies or practices of the Company. 

I believe this is clearing the way for Alex Chalunkal, Sanberg's Chief Investment Officer, to take his place on the board per their 13D/A Filing. 

I continue to be a believer that S3 has more accurate SI %. Ortex and Yahoo have a float of 12.6M shares, but my calculations based on SEC fillings still put it around 9.4M ***AT THE MOST:***

[If anyone can prove a higher float than \~9.4M be my guest and show me](https://preview.redd.it/eozgbbyy1mq91.png?width=437&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f23fc982051ebfa26e40c09b00bdac3149867cd)

There's a strong chance both Ortex and S3 have estimated the same quantity of shares short, but have wildly different percentages due to the difference in share size. That being said, if my float is in line with S3's, their SI share estimates would put us at close to 6.8M shares short at the opening bell yesterday. That's crazy. 

Borrowed shares continued to fluctuate with 250,000 being available at one point (not bullish), but has since returned to 0 (bullish) as of today based on the source I use. I welcome others to confirm share availability to borrow from various sources. And cost to borrow has risen from 25% to 30% from that same source (bullish).

The TA, which is admittedly a weak spot/blind spot for me, confirms bullish analysis. I'd recommend checking out user ItsAllJustASickGame for recent and incredibly in depth TA.

Failure to Deliver data for the first part of September comes out early next week. I'll be watching.

My PT remains a minimum of double digits before I start selling *any* pieces of my play. I did not sell at $8 and I did not sell when I was getting yelled at by bears on here for being a ""bagholder."" My average share price is $5.5 and I'll continue to not sell any until the price of this stock is where it deserves to be. With the short interest now higher and the PIPE closing by Friday, I would not be surprised to see $20+ in the near future. 

My next meal kit arrives on Friday. Togarashi Tilapia and Fried Rice that I'll enjoy preparing myself and an Oven Baked Chickpea Shakshuka that only needs 25minutes in the oven with zero prep. 

The craziest stat I've heard during this entire play:

# It would only take 5,000 people holding 2,000 shares to lock the entire float. 

Repeat that line every chance you get. That shit's insane.

Can someone enlighten me what is going on with this stock? Too big to fail, about to emerge from bankruptcy, banks, creditors and shareholders approved the business plan, in a market ready to explode with tourism back on track - and drops 66% in the last two months?!

*From the outside, it looks well maintained, pleasant, and snug. Bricks and thick, hard wooden logs make up most of the building's outer structure. It's difficult to see through the curtained windows, but the clinking of glasses and boiling of water from within can be heard outside. If not seen for a trail of white and cyan blue smoke coming from a few of the pipes and the chimney of the house. With a sign hanging just above the entrance, made from finest birch wood, serving as a point of reference or destination depending on the person. Offering a variety of goods despite its recent and rather sudden change. Just below the name, it was all there, written and drawn on the sign:*

*Potions, ointments, salves...*

As easy as it is to visit the market and spend a fortune on rare ingredients and top-quality glass. It is never certain if one of those **slackers** calling themselves adventurers would bother to even come over and spend their silver or their gold that they ""earned rightfully"" through a trip to some abandoned dungeons or ruins that were more than likely a resting place of someone's ancestors or aristocratic family.

*But there were necromancers inside raising the dead! We had to intervene!*

**BUT DID YOU HAVE TO STEAL EVERYTHING THAT APPEARED VALUABLE!?**

*Ekhem.*

Got a little personal there, but where was I? Ah yes. The struggles of an Alchemist.

Or rather, owner of a general store that specializes in alchemy.

See. Despite the talent, personal requests when it comes to brewing specific tinctures and specialized medicine, taxes in [Montera](https://i.imgur.com/UMRj22x.png) are no joke. It is a land of opportunity but only if you have the coin.

That's why I had to adapt a little. Redesinging and repurposing one of my older workshops into the [forge](https://i.imgur.com/nFmO07U.jpg) was difficult, not to mention the heart attack when the dwarf told me the original cost of my request. Needless to say, I was grateful Odrun was a dwarf kind enough to have a sick son I managed to help out with a potion I brewed for him. May Shalya bless his soul and keep him safe from another Crimson Rot infection. Nasty thing.

We settled on a larger workplace, both for my assistant and myself. Sacrificing two of my magazines to fit in the forge and my own laboratory. One which she would visit quite often just so we can stock up on supplies.

Yes, the idea with the General store relies heavily on her arrival. I'm quite aware of how specific I was in the requests but it simply won't work even if I were to have a true genius that had even more experience in knowledge in regards to the sacred arts of my work.

No, I needed the strong folk of the mountains, loud, strong but also honorable neighbors to the Dwarves and Orcs. Hardy folk are as famous for their horns during a charge and for the amount of milk their women can produce. None other but minotaurs, holstaurs, cow-people, and bull-people if you will.

Devoted worshipers of Shalya, goddess of life and fertility. *Which fits quite nicely with the jokes you can hear at the tavern about them.*

Yes, that's where my plan is going. To ensure that alongside the potions, herbs, and general supplies. I could expand on the range of goods I have to offer. With my assistant handling the forge and any requests and also resupplying me with **dairy products**.

It's a dangerous game, especially with the fact I haven't stated that in the contract for the job. Nor did I tell that specific detail to anyone in the guild, but it's the milk, and perhaps another fluid that I seek from the hardy Holstaur women.

It is said to have properties that would enhance my potions. It's something I wish to see for myself. That's why I'm hoping to see some hardy adult, or better yet, a mature holstaur woman that has seen her fair share of things. Ready to settle down with a forge as her main workplace, and my lab as a place of relief for her.

Course saying that upfront won't get me anywhere...But that's why I know how to make aphrodisiac and a few other things to make sure her body is willing to cooperate and produce the said milk...No?

I'm certain the creators look down at me right now. No matter what pantheon or aspect. **BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE TO PAY TAXES IN THIS BLOODY CITY!**

*Now did I check on the Alembic? What's that hissing soun-*

You've read all of it? Are you actually interested in this idea?

Yay.

I mean, it would be amazing if you were. The role is painfully specific but if you don't mind playing some MILF or at least some top-heavy gal...Well, all I can say is that I'm as always aiming for mix of story and smut...So while it's gonna be lewd I do imagine other activities to write about and describe. And on that note, long messages. Multi-paragraphs. If you're interested hit me up. If you doubt my writing due to the rambly nature of this post then check out the other prompts!

Feel free to tell me if you'd like to also change something! I'm not against mixing things up! Or even the idea of how he acquires her. Etc.

Though if it's up to me. Some wholesome and lewd combo would fit best. With moments where the theme changes to something more serious/realistic, dealing with taxes, plague, some disease, nothing that ends with death or misery, at least not for our characters. 

Limit wise: Underage and extreme abuse.

But that's for us to discuss. So thanks for reading and hope you have a great day!

"In court brief, Musk says the SEC is unlawfully muzzling him","Elon Musk has some crazy tweets and some tweets that have had a large impact on the crypto market. The crazy thing is that all of his tweets, even those that do not deal directly with Tesla, have to be approved by an attorney. Apparently, Elon Musk does not follow that rule 100% of the time or so the SEC thinks due to some tweets he made about a year ago.

He is now saying in a court document filed with the federal appeals court in Manhattan that the [SEC is muzzling him](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-inc-securities-fraud-907c2915c0484aee8643ada35689938f). 

&gt; The brief says that a provision in the settlement requiring Musk to get prior approval before tweeting about the electric car company is an illegal ‚Äúgovernment-imposed muzzle on Mr. Musk‚Äôs speech before it is made.‚Äù The settlement required that his tweets be approved by a Tesla attorney before being published. The SEC is investigating whether Musk violated the settlement with tweets last November asking Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock.

He has previously unsuccessfully tried to get the settlement that he made with the SEC thrown out by a U.S. District Judge in New York, but was utterly unsuccessful at that. 

I wonder what he is trying to post that his attorneys are not allowing him to post or if this is just posturing due to his tweeting last year. I would not want to be the attorney in charge of reviewing Elon Musk‚Äôs tweets, that is for sure. 

I want to think that crypto is mature enough that a random businessman that likes dog coins and coins named after him does not hold enough power to alter a giant market just by a random shower thought tweet. Unfortunately, I do not think that is the case right now. Right now, the stock market is influenced by mainly government officials comments. Since there is not a government that controls crypto, it could be that there will always be a few people throughout the world that have the power to cause a change in the crypto market based off of a public comment. 

All I know is that Elon Musk is pissed that he has to have his tweets reviewed by a lawyer before they get posted. He also is probably pissed that he is being investigated by the SEC again, but that is a different story. His tweets have not had a huge impact on the market lately and  I personally think that is great. It could be that in a bear market people care less that China is thinking about banning crypto for the 11th time and that Elon Musk thinks that he is the president of DOGE and plans on taking it to Mars with him. 

At least we get some comedy in the midst of this bear market of seeing Elon Musk try to grapple with the SEC and get a settlement that he agreed with overthrown. The one thing that I know is that if he does get unmuzzled there will be some very amusing tweets to follow.",CryptoCurrency,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xqco6j/in_court_brief_musk_says_the_sec_is_unlawfully/,DISCUSSION,pbjclimbing,xqco6j,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xqco6j/in_court_brief_musk_says_the_sec_is_unlawfully/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/xqco6j/in_court_brief_musk_says_the_sec_is_unlawfully/,0,2022-09-28

How to Profit with Crypto from Inflation Surges | Investment Options," 

* Gas prices have continued to fall and will continue to push down headline inflation
* Inflation expectations have dropped recently, and falling gas prices should also help that continue
* Nominal wage growth isn‚Äôt taking off, staving off concerns about a wage-price spiral
* Global supply chain pressures continue to unwind
* Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures.
* The foreign exchange markets provide a unique opportunity to capitalize on inflationary environments.

**How Inflation and the Fed Affect Cryptocurrencies**

Cryptocurrencies behave similarly to other risk assets during periods of inflation and higher interest rates. For example, the Federal Reserve typically responds to inflation by increasing its benchmark interest rate. This tends to reduce the demand for speculative investment assets by making secure, debt-based securities more valuable. This also tends to slow down investor activity overall by making liquidity more expensive. Therefore, in an inflationary environment, the Fed will raise interest rates and there will be less capital in the market to invest in cryptocurrencies. The same function is used to explain why the stock market and corporate bond markets similarly underperform during periods of inflation.

Overall, it‚Äôs easier to invest in speculative, risky assets like cryptocurrency or stocks in an era of cheap money and high liquidity. Indeed, one of the prevailing theories on how cryptocurrency grew so valuable is that investors simply had lots of money and few better alternatives. Both of those trends will change as the Federal Reserve raises its interest rates. This will likely lead to a brief continuation of downward price movement among all capital gains-oriented assets until inflation comes back down to target levels.

**Opportunities**

As traders, inflationary pressures and resulting market imbalances represent opportunities to capitalize on global momentum. 

As investors, you naturally stick to a long-term strategy and turn a blind eye to a red portfolio. But is this the only option? Is there a way to earn interest while simply waiting for the bull market to return? There are several ways actually, for example, one can come to crypto investment companies that use different strategies for both bull/bear markets and continue to earn high yields. As an example here, let‚Äôs consider some of the strategies that [Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/), CeDeFi custodial crypto investment platform, uses to combine working with digital assets and various protocols to create profitable investment products:

The first and foremost investment strategy is Fixed Yield, which allows investors to earn high APY (Annual Percentage Yield) rates on their crypto assets. In fixed yield strategies, investors earn industry-leading yields on their staked cryptocurrency assets. As of now, APY on staked Bitcoin sits at 6.5%, 7.8% on Ethereum, and 11.6% on stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Investors are projected to earn more than 20% on their staked CVX, the highest amongst custodial crypto investment platforms. 

The platform has also unveiled three ‚ÄúCeDeFi‚Äù strategies, offering investors the best of both worlds. The three CeDeFi strategies are ‚ÄúSoft Long on ETH,‚Äù ‚ÄúSoft Short on ETH,‚Äù and DeFi Token Farming. The first two strategies aim to generate 45% ROI and 25% ROI through price movements of ETH and rewards for providing liquidity. The third strategy is a basket of incentivized liquidity pools with DeFi tokens on popular AMMs (like Curve) that can generate up to 40% ROI.",investing_discussion,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/xqf147/how_to_profit_with_crypto_from_inflation_surges/,,MDiffenbakh,xqf147,/r/investing_discussion/comments/xqf147/how_to_profit_with_crypto_from_inflation_surges/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/xqf147/how_to_profit_with_crypto_from_inflation_surges/,0,2022-09-28
Investing in Tech Stocks,"Many of the most valuable companies in the world are technology companies. These are some of the most dominant and impressive tech stocks that investors should consider in the fourth quarter:

[Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the leading online retailer and the leading provider of cloud computing infrastructure. Founder Jeff Bezos stepped down in July, opening a new chapter for the dominant tech company.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a dominant software company known for its Windows PC operating system and Office productivity software. Microsoft is also the second-largest provider of cloud infrastructure behind Amazon.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes the iPhone, the iPad, and Mac computers. Intense customer loyalty ensures plenty of repeat customers, and a growing array of services makes Apple‚Äôs ecosystem sticky.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Intel designs and manufactures central processing units (CPUs) for PCs and servers, as well as specialty chips for uses such as artificial intelligence. The company is betting big on manufacturing, with plans to make chips for other companies.

Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the dominant provider of the enterprise networking hardware that forms the backbone of the internet.

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the top dog in the video streaming industry, spending billions of dollars each year on content to keep its ever-growing subscriber base hooked.

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is the largest social media company, with more than 2 billion daily active users across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. The company sees virtual reality as its future.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the parent company of online search giant Google and the popular Android operating system for smartphones.

Would you mortgage an inherited house and invest in an index fund?,"The value of the house is about ¬£300k and is located in a foreign country where one can mortgage it at about 3.5% at current prices.

My thinking is front-loading investments into an index fund, pay off the loan instead of investing the equivalent into the stock market. On top of that, receive rent on the property.

This is my modelling:
Assuming a stock market return of 8.5%:

A 300,000 sum at 5%/year over 25 years, would equate to ¬£967,529

The counter factual is not mortgaging the property and putting the +/- ¬£1500/month directly into an index fund. At a 8.5% return, this would be ¬£118,000 over 25 years.

Is there a reason to not do this? The rent coming out of the house would pay for the loan payments.

Key Part Financial Plan,"Continuing my studies, and there is one thing I just can not get around: 

How do people not prioritize Whole Life insurance?

The answer is simple. People are just not educated on what it offers them. Instead, they think of it as a cost, a bill that only provides a payout in the case of a death. 

However in the case of whole life, it not only provides a payout on your death, but it is also used as a flexible investment vehicle with virtually no downfalls. 

So, for a little bit of education today, I would like you to think of a investment vehicle that‚Äôs tax free, not tied up to the stock market (inconsistent), where you can use the money you‚Äôve invested without interupting the ‚Äúsexy‚Äù part of compound interest‚Ä¶..

When Isekai Goes Wrong: Chapter 8,"Chapter 8

Sun was just cresting the horizon, the first rays of light just beginning to creep their way through windows as the bells started ringing.¬† This was not the humble tolling to call early risers to morning masses.¬† The bells clanged discordantly, a call to all that heard them, a warning that something was wrong.¬† A young acolyte rushed up the incline to Augustus's house, taking the stairs 3 at a time, before pounding on the door frame.

&amp;#x200B;

""Priest!¬† Priest!¬† You are needed at the shrine.¬† Calamity has come and your skills are required."" the page screamed at the top of his lungs.¬† The Head priest had sent anyone and everyone he could find, to locate and return with any villager with even a modicum of healing potential.

&amp;#x200B;

Augustus pulled the door open, and stared daggers at the young man.¬† ""It is the crack of dawn, and I had a long night.¬† This better be important.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Deathly so sir.¬† The caravan that was supposed to arrive yesterday.¬† It was found this morning by a patrol; it was driven off the road and left in a state of complete destruction.¬† Those that could be moved, have been brought to the shrine, I am told though that there are still those who require help at the site proper""

&amp;#x200B;

""Dire news indeed, I shall fetch my things and be along shortly.""

&amp;#x200B;

""There is one more thing sir; I'm told your wife's sister was in the caravan and is still at the site.¬† I bid you haste; I am told her condition is most severe""

&amp;#x200B;

The next moments were naught but a blur to Augustus.¬† He did not remember closing the door, he knew not how he ended up dressed, nor when he had grabbed his staff.¬† The only thing he could say for sure was that the next moment he clearly remembered, he was half way to the wreck; running with all his might.¬† Seconds stretched to feel like hours, his foot falls leaving him feeling like he was traversing his way through waist high swamp.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, he rounded a bend in the road and saw it.¬† The caravan had indeed by driven off the road, and set up by some manner of monster.¬† Bodies littered the ground, and blood was everywhere.¬† The wagons still smoldered and spewed forth black smoke.¬† In the middle of all the carnage, surrounded by the corpse of no less than six, lay Mary.¬† A patrol man stood next to her and poured what little magic he could muster into his attempts to heal her.¬† Upon getting closer Augustus retched at the sight before him.¬†¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Three of the corpses had their faces caved in, it would be impossible to identify who they were.¬† Though given their rough clothing and crude weapons, it was reasonable to assume that they were bandits.¬† Two of the corpses were clearly children, he guessed them to be no more than 7 years old.¬† The final corpse; huddled over them, in a vain attempt at defense or perhaps in mourning; was a man in his middle years, like as not the children's father.

&amp;#x200B;

Slightly off to the side, lay Mary, bloody bruised and battered.¬† How she was still alive was beyond Augustus, she was covered in blood, and he strongly suspected that much of it was hers.¬† Her face was beaten to the hells and back, the right side the consistency of ground meat.¬† Her body the color of over ripe figs.¬† Her right arm was beyond saving, twisted and smashed as it was, the only sane and safe thing to do was remove it before it rotted and poisoned her from the inside out.¬† Her left was barely better, clearly broken but he suspected that it could still be mended.¬† Both of her knuckles were raw and torn, bits of bone still clinging to the skin.¬†¬†

&amp;#x200B;

""Guess that explains the bandits"" he muttered to himself.¬† He kneeled down next to her and began to pour every ounce of mana he could summon, into healing her.¬† The initial shock he always felt when healing wounds, the connection of one's mana to another, renewed his horror and awe towards Mary.¬† How she was still alive was completely beyond him, the level of physical damage she had endured should have killed her twice over.¬† Even with his reserves of mana, he had no hope of healing her fully.¬† At best he could manage to stabilize her enough, that she could be moved safely.¬† Seconds turned to minutes; minutes turned to hours.¬† Slowly but surely her skin knitted itself back together, wounds at least superficially stitching themselves whole.¬† Her breathing shifted from croaking moans, to simply pained wheezing.

&amp;#x200B;

With a wave of his hand, Augustus commanded the patrol men to carry her to the shrine.¬† They lifted her onto a makeshift stretcher, and slowly made their way back to town.¬† The sun was above the tree tops as Augustus slowly made his way back to town, trying to figure out what his next move was.¬† Rumor of this tragedy would no doubt be making its way around town, and Brunhilda would need to be made aware of her sisters' presence.¬†¬†¬†But he knew his wife all too well, the sight of her sister in such a state would send her into a blind rage.¬† She would tear apart the heavens and earth to find who did this.¬† And in such a rage, she was not likely to take steps to protect herself.¬† There had been too much death already, he could not bear the thought of her dying while on her quest for vengeance.

&amp;#x200B;

As the sun crested the treetops, Brunhilda began to worry about where Augustus had gotten off to.¬† The pounding at the door so early in the morning had woken her, same as him.¬† She hadn't managed to catch most of the conversation, but he had returned shortly thereafter.¬† Gotten dressed, grabbed his things, and left as if in a daze.¬† He had been out for several hours at this point, far too much time for morning mass.¬† It was unlike him to disappear like this, and as time passed her mind twisted and churned.

&amp;#x200B;

She decided to take a walk to clear her head.¬† She would head into town, she decided.¬† Perhaps one of the other villagers had seen her husband, and if not, some pleasant conversation would do wonders for distracting her.¬† She chooses something simple but loose, she had never been a dress kind of person, but the thought of tight clothing made her skin crawl.¬† Before heading out, she peeked into Asmodaus's room, he was still dead to the world.

&amp;#x200B;

The walk into town only took a few minutes, but it felt much longer.¬† She kept expecting to see Augustus walking towards her, she wanted desperately to find out where he had gone and what was taking him so long.¬† Her head still mildly throbbed from all the drinking the night before.¬† It was her son's coming of age celebration, but maybe she had over done it just a bit.¬† Rounding the corner, she reached the edge of town; it surprised her how active it was.¬† People where running hither and tither, and she could just sort of make out a large group on the outskirts of the village shrine.¬† She racked her brain for any kind of ceremony or event that might have been happening today, it came back empty.

&amp;#x200B;

Shrugging, she made her way towards the town's market.¬† The party last night had put a bit of a dent in her supply of more common items like lard, carrots, eggs, and salt; best to restock now least an unseasonal storm blow through and the trek become overly troublesome.¬† As she entered the store, she was rather surprised at the lack of people.¬† Given how many others she had seen around town, she had been sure the market would be crowded.¬† Taking advantage of the lack of people, she takes her time to wonder around checking the shelves and trying to find the freshest produce.¬† The choices were, less than stellar.¬† She could have sworn that a caravan was supposed to have come through yesterday, surely, they must have brought something.¬† ""Perhaps they just haven't had time to stock yet"" she concluded to herself.¬† Picking up the few things she could find Brunhilda made her way over to pay for her goods.¬† As always Miss Peterson sat behind the counter, slowly paging her way through her most recent book.

&amp;#x200B;

""Slow day?"" Brunhilda inquired as she began to unload her items.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúOh, hello Brunhilda‚Äù Miss Peterson says, almost jumping out of her skin.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúMust be a particularly good book‚Äù Brunhilda thought to herself.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúYes, there have been fewer people in then normal today.  Apparently there has been some big hullabaloo¬†that happened outside of town.  Think everyone‚Äôs trying to sneak a peek.  You know how it can be in these small villages.  Even the smallest things can feel like some world shattering events.‚Äù mussing, she rang up the last of the items.  ‚Äú2 gold, 7 silver, and 24 copper please‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Brunhilda grimaced ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a little high, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúSupplies are running a bit low, supply and demand‚Äù she absent-mindedly waves her hand around.  ‚ÄúYou know how it is.  Plus, I think I heard that whatever happened outside of town had to do with the caravan we were expecting.  So, it‚Äôs going to be a bit longer till the next one.‚Äù  Peterson replied¬†matter of factly, having already gone back to her book.

&amp;#x200B;

Her business completed, Brunhilda exits the shop and returns home; ‚Äòmaybe Augustus will have finally returned and she could more information about what was happening‚Äô she thought.  Despite the sun overhead, and the lack of much wind,¬†the shadows of the forest left the air feeling chilly.  The shadows seemed to move and shift strangely, causing Brunhilda to grasp her little sack a bit more closely.  Even without her weapons, she was more than a match for anything stupid enough to try and come at her; but never a bad idea to be safe, and she could hardly risk dropping her goods in surprise.  The shadows continue to shift, and she can‚Äôt get past the feeling that something is watching her.  Step by steady step, the front door of her home inches forward.  Each step closer to home, pulls at her senses, the invisible eyes bore into her back, something deep inside of her screams to turn around; return to town, return before it‚Äôs too late.

&amp;#x200B;

One final push, and she‚Äôs inside.  Light leaks into the room from the windows, and she can smell something cooking on the stove.  ‚ÄòAsmodaus might be up‚Äô flickers through her mind; the feeling of being watched is gone, but the lingering unease that accompanied it remains.  Long quick steps bring her to the kitchen, where Asmodaus is grilling up some leftover bacon.  With a start at the sudden noise and rush of movement he turns.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúOh, hey mom, was wondering where you went.  Was dad with you?‚Äù he turns back to the stove and pokes at the sizzling meat.  The steady \*POP\* \*POP\* as the meat cooked, is somehow deeply calming to Brunhilda.  Such a mundane thing, but it represents normalcy, and somehow normalcy is what she desperately needs right now.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúNo... He had to leave early to attend to something, didn‚Äôt get the chance to ask him what was happening or when I should expect him home.‚Äù  A pained look creeps across her face.  ‚ÄòWhere was Augustus?  Why had he been out for so long?  What is¬†this feeling deep in my chest telling me to go into town?‚Äô  All these thoughts and more flooded Brunhilda‚Äôs mind.  Her mind raced; her thoughts fought each other for dominance.  Finally with a heavy sigh she made up her mind.  Setting down her purchased goods she turned towards her son.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúFinish up your breakfast Asmodaus, you‚Äôre going into town with me.  I don‚Äôt know where you father went, but I have a pretty good idea of who might.‚Äù  With a silent nod, Asmodaus quenched the stove‚Äôs fire, finished off the cooked meat, and made ready to leave.¬†

&amp;#x200B;

Upon arriving back in town, the crowded of on lookers around the shrine¬†had grown.  While picking out individual people in the crowd was impossible, the sheer size implied that basically everyone in the village was milling about shrine.  A couple minutes of pushing, and they had managed to get close enough to see the shrine‚Äôs entrance.  As luck would have it, just as they managed to get to the front of the line, Augustus was just starting to push his way through going the other way.

&amp;#x200B;

""Brunhilda!¬† What are you doing here?"" Augustus yelps in surprise.

&amp;#x200B;

""Trying to find you, you disappeared this morning and have been gone for hours.¬† What in the nine hells has been going on?"" Brunhilda inquired, her tone a mix of anxiety and frustration.

&amp;#x200B;

""From what we could gather, it seems the caravan was attacked on the outskirts of town.¬† Reports from survivors are jumbled, at best.¬† Apparently, the caravan had been running a bit behind, something about a broken wheel on one of the wagons."" waving his hand in dismissal at the specifics.¬† ""Anyway, they were getting into town late, sun was setting.¬† Seems some bandits used the shadows to set up an ambush, and drove the carts off the road.¬† The guards fought valiantly, but there were too many and far too well organized.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Bandits?!¬† Why would bandits risk getting so close to town?"" Brunhilda screeched.¬† She was about to inquire deeper when it struck her... The party last night, basically the whole village had swung by... there would have been fewer guards on patrol.

&amp;#x200B;

Noticing the shift in her expression. Augustus nodded.¬† ""Personal opinion?¬† I think they have a source within the village.¬† There's no way they would have taken such a brazen chance, unless they had it on beyond good authority that the guard would be lacking that night.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Those monsters"" she hissed.

&amp;#x200B;

""Brundee, it gets worse..."" he hesitated for a moment. ""Mary was on that caravan.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh gods!¬† No, no, no, no.¬† Don't tell me"" Howling she grips Augustus's tunic, her knees beginning to buckle.

&amp;#x200B;

""She's alive, she will live."" He blurts out, having caught his wording a second too late.¬† ""We don't know how, but she managed to take down a few of the bastards and live to tell the tale.¬† Some of the other survivors claim that she saved them.¬† She's in the shrine resting.""

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm going to see her"" a look of determination fills her eyes

&amp;#x200B;

""I can't let you do that Brundee.¬† She's not up for visitors yet.""¬† He says gently placing a hand on her arm.

&amp;#x200B;

""Visitors!?¬† I'm her fucking sister Augustus.¬† Now let me pass"" she moves to shove past him.¬† A flash of light is all the warning she gets before her husband, a man half her weight and a good 2 heads shorter than her, stops her in her tracks.

&amp;#x200B;

The air cracked and snapped as all the ambient moisture coalesced,¬†a web of frost and ice wove its way into being around Brunhilda.  Her feet became encased in a solid 5 inches of ice, her torso growing a compact 3 inches of frost.  Dark blue magic pours off Augustus,¬†""Gods damn it Brunhilda!¬† For once in your life, you will listen to me!!""¬† Augustus screams as he pulled¬†his hand back from¬†her chest.¬† His voice having lost all of its warmth.¬† His eyes locked with Brunhilda.

&amp;#x200B;

Brunhilda stares daggers at him; if looks could kill, both of them would have been turned into blood spatters across the ground.  Without breaking eye contact, Brunhilda takes a deep breath and flexes her muscles.  With a resounding crack, the ice around her body shattered and flew away; coating Augustus and Asmodaus with tiny crystalline shards.  With a slight grunt she strikes the ice around her feet, pulverizing the frozen mass of water, before turning to leave. ¬†¬† ""We WILL be talking about his later.‚Äù She said in a cold matter of fact tone.¬†¬† ‚ÄúI'm going to find the bastards who did this.""¬† She storms off back to the house, anger hastening her steps.¬† In what feels like the blink of an eye, she's throwing the front door open and storming into the bedroom.¬† From the wardrobe she pulls out her axe and beginnings to don her armor.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm coming with you.¬† We can make whoever did this to Auntie Mary pay"" Asmodaus says, rushing in behind her.

&amp;#x200B;

""No.""  Her voice monotone, she doesn‚Äôt even look at him.  Just continues to gather what she needs.

&amp;#x200B;

""But I want to help"" he cries.

&amp;#x200B;

""You are staying home, Asmodaus.""  A hint of annoyance creeps into her voice.

&amp;#x200B;

""I can follow you if I want"" Asmodaus mutters under his breath.

&amp;#x200B;

With speed that defies her size, Brunhilda whips around and hauls Asmodaus into the air by the scruff of his shirt.¬† ""You will stay here, and that is final"" she snaps at him.

&amp;#x200B;

""I'm no longer a kid, I'm going with you"" he replies, steel in his voice.

&amp;#x200B;

""THIS IS NOT UP FOR DISCUSSION!"" Brunhilda snarls.¬† Tossing Asmodaus less then gently backwards, where he stumbles but ends up¬†on his feet.

&amp;#x200B;

For the first time in his life, Asmodaus is truly afraid of his mother.¬† Gone is the over protective woman who only wants to safeguard¬†her baby from the world.¬† Gone is the mother he thought he knew.¬† What stands before him was barely contained rage, hatred boiling over, vengeance made manifest.¬† Something deep inside him warned at what might happen should he continue to push the subject.  ""Yes. Mom"" eyes downturned, sullen acceptance in every word he makes his way back to his room.",HFY,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xqlaz4/when_isekai_goes_wrong_chapter_8/,OC,Zhule88,xqlaz4,/r/HFY/comments/xqlaz4/when_isekai_goes_wrong_chapter_8/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/xqlaz4/when_isekai_goes_wrong_chapter_8/,0,2022-09-28
"MINDMED, MNMD, DOWN 50% ON MONTH, ANOTHER 33% TODAY ‚Äì WHY?"," 

#### Key points:

* MindMed had a reverse stock split only a month ago
* MNMD has fallen 50% since then and another 33% today
* The point of the stock split was to be able to raise capital ‚Äì which they‚Äôve just done

MindMed (NASDAQ: MNMD) stock has fallen 50% or so in this past month and is now down another 33% premarket this morning. That‚Äôs not a good look it has to be said. The interesting question is why this is happening? The answer to that is that MNMD has just issued more stock to provide working capital. That‚Äôs the explanation for today‚Äôs fall that is. But the explanation for the fall over the past month? More likely than not that‚Äôs the expectation that just such a capital raising exercise will be undertaken. Which is a much more interesting point for us to be aware of.

As to what MindMed does as we‚Äôve explained before it looks at the clinical and medical effects of varied psychoactives. This looks like a sensible thing to be doing. We know that these drugs have interesting effects upon human beings so let‚Äôs see if there are any positive medical effects over and above the pure fun that people take them for. This does rather depend upon governments allowing such experimentation but the Feds in the US have become markedly better at that just recently.

We do also need to note though that it still takes years of experimentation to discover anything useful ‚Äì rather than just fun ‚Äì and then proof up to approval takes years more. This swallows capital and the uncertainty means that banks and large companies aren‚Äôt going to do that funding. The risk is going to have to be carried by speculative equity funding from the public markets. Which is where we gain our little lesson here from MindMed. 

As we can see from that MNMD stock price chart there was a huge leap a month back. That was the [MindMed reverse stock split](https://www.asktraders.com/analysis/mindmed-mnmd-up-1247-or-really-down-11-for-meme-stock/). That was simply the declaration that what had previously been 15 pieces of stock was now going to be one. The reason for that was to get that MNMD stock price back over the NASDAQ $1 minimum offer price. Be a penny stock and eventually you lose the NSDAQ listing. So, something must be done.

The reason to maintain the NASDAQ listing is that it‚Äôs a liquid market that it‚Äôs possible to raise capital upon. So, a company which needs to raise capital will make sure that it retains the NASDAQ listing. Fair enough ‚Äì but then that allows us to go one step further. A development pharma company, reliant upon eating capital to do the development, when it does a reverse stock split to maintain the NASDAQ listing ‚Äì what might we think comes next? That‚Äôs right, a capital raise, that‚Äôs the point of the consolidation after all.

So, we get the reverse stock split, the NASDAQ quote is maintained, but then there‚Äôs that feeling that a capital raise could be in the works. As has in fact just happened and as has driven the MNMD stock price.",asktraders12,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktraders12/comments/xql59l/mindmed_mnmd_down_50_on_month_another_33_today_why/,,Asktraders178,xql59l,/r/asktraders12/comments/xql59l/mindmed_mnmd_down_50_on_month_another_33_today_why/,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktraders12/comments/xql59l/mindmed_mnmd_down_50_on_month_another_33_today_why/,0,2022-09-28

Digital payments in India have shot up in the last two years amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Undoubtedly, cashless transactions are very beneficial to all. It saves time, energy and paper. But along with the several benefits associated with the digital transactions, the problem of scamsters siphoning off the money from people accounts cannot be denied. Nowadays, scammers find different ways to rob people off their money.

During the lockdown induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, people received money in their bank accounts just by pressing a button, Nirmala Sitharaman said. She was speaking in Pune on ‚Äô20 years of Modi governance‚Äô. Several doubts were raised about how electronic payments would work, especially in rural areas where Internet connectivity is patchy, but now ‚Äúin spite of COVID India leads the world in UPI payments,‚Äù said the minister.

According to the data released by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), UPI transactions rose astronomically to ‚Çπ10.7 trillion in August.

The State Bank of India (SBI) has shared some UPI security Tips to make UPI transaction safer and secure. While sharing the video, SBI said, ‚ÄúAlways remember these UPI security Tips while using or making UPI transactions. Stay Alert &amp; #SafeWithSBI.‚Äù

Investing is one of the ways in which you can make your hard-earned money to do the work for you. This term is very pleasant to ears but in reality, investing does have its risk factor. The first task of any prudent investor is to make a decision on whether to invest or not based upon the trade-off between the potential risk and the returns respectively, Investing in ***gold mining*** and allied sectors is also considered to be a great investment option.

**Diversified investment portfolio:** 

By diversification, one can understand that there is prudentially in laying eggs in varied baskets. Investing in varied industries and assets which include residential and commercial properties, bonds, shares, savings accounts, and term deposits.

When you have a diverse portfolio you are not heavily exposed to a specific market-based risk. When you follow this strategy to invest in various classes it essentially means when the value of any asset class falls it doesn't result in the complete financial portfolio all across as the risk is essentially divided.

**Watch out for scammers:**

we all are aware of scammers and the sheer risk they present is sometimes ignored by us, by sweeping it under the carpet with the mindset of infallibility.

Global Market Stress Is Piling Up. Something Is About to Break,"(Via [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-09-27/global-market-stress-is-piling-up-something-is-about-to-break) non-paywall link at [https://archive.ph/qkuyd](https://archive.ph/qkuyd))

# Global Market Stress Is Piling Up. Something Is About to Break

*Central  banks have dialed up their resolve to combat inflation in recent weeks.  In response, markets have become so unmoored a major financial and  economic¬†crisis can‚Äôt be ruled out. That means global monetary policy  hawkishness may have hit its peak and something will eventually  break.¬†The impact on four big asset classes will be very different.*

## Things are starting to break

It‚Äôs [absolute mayhem](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-26/why-investors-are-facing-even-more-market-instability)  in global markets right now. In the US, the S&amp;P 500 re-confirmed a  bear market¬†after sinking through the June lows and the two-year  Treasury bond has [sold off](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/treasuries-extend-losses-driving-yields-to-new-multi-year-highs)  for a record number of days. In the UK, the currency dropped to  all-time lows against the US dollar¬†and government bond yields mounted  their highest climb ever¬†in a two-day period. In Europe, German 10-year  yields breezed through the 2% barrier,¬†having started the year with a  negative yield. In Japan, the central bank was forced to intervene in  currency markets as the yen fell to its lowest against the US dollar  since 1998. Italian bonds are taking it on the chin with¬†10-year  government bond yields rising¬†above 4.5% for the first time since the  height of¬†the sovereign debt crisis in 2013.Something is [going to break](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-23/wall-street-risks-a-breaking-point-after-week-of-monetary-mania). The Fed‚Äôs resolve will soon face [its most pressing test](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-09-27/the-federal-reserve-s-inflation-fight-how-far-will-it-go).  There are so many stressors piling up, it truly is the everything risk  right now. Policymakers cannot possibly put out all the fires. One of  these economic pathogens will metastasize into a full-blown crisis. And  that‚Äôs when the policy about-face will come. How this plays out in four  distinct financial markets --¬†equities, fixed income, currencies and  housing ‚Äî will differ.The¬†dizzying rise in the dollar is the most worrying development because episodes of prolonged dollar strength usually [end¬†in crisis](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/morgan-stanley-s-wilson-says-dollar-surge-tends-to-end-in-crisis?srnd=premium). The good news for fixed income investors is that a crisis would cap¬†[bond losses](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-24/the-great-bond-bubble-is-poof-gone-in-worst-year-since-1949).  Crisis or not, stocks are still in for a slow grind as earnings  disappoint for many more quarters into the future. Housing will¬†suffer,  too.

## The Fed is hurting housing but not labor...yet

A  litany of market strategists are screaming for the Fed to relent,  advising that inflation has peaked. But central banks can‚Äôt sit idly by  as the¬†cost of living crisis punishes households. Much of the inflation  issue is related to supply constraints ‚Äî a lack of qualified labor or¬†a  lack of industrial capacity to meet demand. Lacking supply-side tools  and committed to bringing inflation down,¬†central banks have decided to¬†  crunch demand to bring it in line with the diminished supply.When  the latest¬†US inflation numbers came out showing core CPI¬†at an  annualized rate of 7%,¬†Bloomberg Economics projected that¬† ‚Äúgas prices  will weigh on the CPI in September, while core inflation accelerates.‚Äù  Such numbers would virtually guarantee¬†more hawkishness from the Fed ‚Äî  and a rise of three-quarters of a percentage point in rates in November,  right before the US mid-term election.So  far, the rise in interest rates hasn‚Äôt cooled the labor market though.  Weekly initial jobless claims remain low and the number of continuing  claims has actually fallen recently. That‚Äôs a good thing for laborers.  But it also adds incentive for¬†the Fed to raise rates because of the  worry¬†that high inflation in a tight labor market will feed through into  wages and then back into goods and services when companies pass those  wage costs onto customers.The one area where¬†the impact of the Fed‚Äôs rate hikes is visible is housing. Mortgage rates are now up to 6.3%, the [highest since 2008](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-22/mortgage-rates-in-us-jump-to-6-29-highest-since-october-2008).  If you look at GDPNow, the Atlanta Fed‚Äôs tracker of GDP, almost all of  the weakness is coming from¬†housing. After the latest housing starts  report from the US Census Bureau, the most recent update¬†said¬†‚Äúthe  nowcast of third-quarter residential investment growth decreased from  -20.8 percent to -24.5 percent.‚Äù It‚Äôs this¬†massive reduction in  residential investment that has their GDP estimate for the third quarter  just barely positive¬†at 0.3%. Outside of housing, the US economy is  doing just fine. So the full force of the Fed‚Äôs policy moves clearly  haven‚Äôt filtered through into the wider economy yet.

## The US dollar rules over everything

The  resilience in¬†the US economy¬†has allowed the Fed to grow¬†increasingly  hawkish.¬†The result is not just higher interest rates and lower equity  prices but also a strong dollar. That currency effect forces other  central banks to take hawkish action themselves, putting additional  downward pressure on global¬†economies. The UK is the [perfect example](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/uk-meltdown-raises-specter-that-bond-vigilantes-are-returning).The  Bank of England has been raising rates at a steady quarter- or  half-percentage point rate at each policy meeting. However, that pace  hasn‚Äôt kept up with the Fed, adding to the pressure on the¬†British  pound. Then, last week, in an effort¬†to boost growth, the new British  government announced tax cuts that [went far beyond](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-23/uk-bonds-plunge-as-uk-dmo-ramps-up-gilt-sales-more-than-expected) what markets had expected --¬†at a time when the labor market is tight, inflation is high and the currency is falling.Markets  reacted negatively and violently sending the pound to a record low  against the US dollar.¬†Bonds had their worst selloff in decades¬†and the  stock market fell. The message is that any central bank that doesn‚Äôt  keep pace with the Fed will face the same unpalatable policy choice:  either allow¬†their currency to weaken, hence fueling more inflation,  or¬†take¬†rates higher, eventually suffocating the domestic economy.These¬†economic strains and the associated market volatility raise the risk¬†of [liquidity draining¬†](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/dollar-swaps-face-biggest-collapse-since-fed-2011-liquidity-plan)¬†in  safe assets¬†that will eventually produce a credit crunch. The ructions  we have experienced over the past week simply can‚Äôt continue without  something breaking. Credit crunches are inherently deflationary events.  So, if central banks press on and something does break,¬†it will subdue a  lot of the built-up inflationary pressure, forcing an about-face in  policy.

## By the numbers

* May 2002 The last time the US dollar was stronger than today

## What comes next?

The  tricky part is knowing exactly which¬†dams will break or¬†when it will  happen. My base case is that we see market stresses build to a  flashpoint next quarter, forcing a climb-down from central banks and an  easing of the pace of rate hikes. Here‚Äôs how I see it playing out  in¬†bonds, equities, currencies and housing.In  the US government bond market, the yield curve is inverted, with  investors getting lower coupons for longer-maturity debt. This inversion  is unusual because investors need to be compensated for the risk of  holding assets over a longer period of time. It generally only happens  before recessions because markets anticipate rate cuts.By  the time the Fed‚Äôs policy rate hits 4% in November or December, a  credit crunch will be visible and the rate hikes will¬†slow. With 10-year  Treasury yields already approaching 4%, we‚Äôre very near¬†a peak  in¬†long-term yields. Two-year yields are even higher, near 4.30%,  indicating that top is also close. Getting a decent yield without  concern it will climb much further is an attractive investment. Some  investors, like DoubleLine‚Äôs Jeffrey Gundlach are [  already buying](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/gundlach-starts-buying-as-10-year-us-yields-set-for-record-spike).In  equities, the environment is most¬†akin to the early 2000s because the  elevated valuations of the pandemic can only be supported in the most  benign earnings environments. I expect earnings to [continue to underwhelm](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-25/nasdaq-100-faces-10-drop-as-inflation-hits-tech-profits?srnd=premium)  for many quarters to come. That will put downward pressure on  valuations,¬†even though¬†a whole generation of investors will continue¬†to  buy the dip under the false premise of missing out on the next rally.

They  may be misguided. We‚Äôve already had four months of earnings downgrades  outpacing upgrades. My colleague Heather Burke writes that ‚Äústruggling  US stocks are unlikely to see much relief from the upcoming  third-quarter earnings season‚Äù. And a¬†recession of unknown depth and  duration likely lies ahead of us. All that¬†suggests more earnings pain  to come. Just like during the period after the tech bust in 2000, the  drip-drip of earnings misses will exact a toll on investor psychology,  grinding equities lower until we see serious capitulation. After  that,¬†the business cycles will be hopefully long enough to build gains.  That wasn‚Äôt the case¬†from 1999 to 2012 and that was toxic for portfolio  returns.

In  currencies, because stress is building, the US dollar is getting bid.  And that will continue until we hit the flashpoint that causes central  banks to reverse course. But the dollar‚Äôs rise has become parabolic,  suggesting the moment of truth won‚Äôt take long.

I  believe we‚Äôre nearing a secular peak in the dollar. I wouldn‚Äôt¬†be  surprised to see it much lower from here as it was after the double top  in 2001 and 2002.

Last  but not least is housing.¬†In the US, housing has become increasingly  unaffordable due to the double whammy of lofty¬†house prices and  rising¬†interest rates. That‚Äôs driving people out of the market for¬†home  purchases, thereby increasing the¬†demand and prices of rental units.  Rent inflation is one of the biggest problems in the cost of living  crisis.

Fed  Chair Jerome Powell said outright at the last FOMC press conference  that his aim in raising rates is to cool house prices and rents. Some  markets are [already starting to show cracks](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/us-home-price-growth-slowed-in-july-as-housing-market-cools?srnd=premium).  The decline¬†should not be as crisis-inducing as it was in the wake of  2008¬†because households carry much less debt now than they did at the  peak of the housing bubble.

Nevertheless,  as housing is the middle class‚Äô principal asset, it will inflict enough  pain on consumer balance sheets to slow consumption and, thus,  inflation.

But it‚Äôs the dollar‚Äôs vertiginous rise that mostly suggests we‚Äôre nearing peak hawkishness. It‚Äôs a sign that¬†investors are¬†[seeking safe assets](https://archive.ph/o/qkuyd/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-26/traders-who-just-want-to-survive-sit-on-5-trillion-cash-pile?srnd=premium)  as fear pervades the market. This¬†kind¬†of market environment¬†can‚Äôt last  without a release valve from policy or it ends in a crisis. When the  turn comes, it will be¬†bullish for bonds but bearish for the dollar. It  will be a while before housing and equities can recover.",investing,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/xpy1a6/global_market_stress_is_piling_up_something_is/,,polloponzi,xpy1a6,/r/investing/comments/xpy1a6/global_market_stress_is_piling_up_something_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/xpy1a6/global_market_stress_is_piling_up_something_is/,0,2022-09-28

The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 (NYSEARCA: [SPY](https://pennystocks.com/ticker/?symbol=SPY)) tapped fresh 2022 lows in the stock market today.

Apple Ditches iPhone Production Increase After Demand Falters,"&gt; Apple Inc. is backing off plans to increase production of its new iPhones this year after an anticipated surge in demand failed to materialize, according to people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg News reports.

This is inline preliminary reports from Fedex and Ford. Markets, consumer, economy, FX, and treasury yields continue to deteriorate badly, however inflation is hiding much of the pain in the numbers and statistics. Also note that headline CPI is clouded by releases from the SPR which is expected to end this October and energy is likely to spike in the winter due to the current EU/Russia conflict. 

I would also like to point out recent earnings from HD and SBUX where each reported lower volume but higher sales as a result of higher pricing. Inflation is extremely embedded into our economy, yet markets have not come to terms with the pain or the time (years) that will be required to bring it back to normal levels. 

There is also a very interesting dichotomy between corporate leaders and Fed officials. While many Fed officials see a softish landing or refuse to consider the possibility of a deep recession, note that major CEOs have flagged a hard landing as early as summer.

While the S&amp;P has begun to come off lower into the 15xish forward multiple, it should rightfully be lower as a result of the higher rates. Additionally, earnings expectations have yet to come down. This is partly why all major banks have begun to forecast a S&amp;P in the low 3000s.  

There is no such thing as a free lunch in the stock market and the gains we've seen over the last two years will be paid back in blood.",investing,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/xpzms6/apple_ditches_iphone_production_increase_after/,,Player896,xpzms6,/r/investing/comments/xpzms6/apple_ditches_iphone_production_increase_after/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/xpzms6/apple_ditches_iphone_production_increase_after/,0,2022-09-28
"TREX Global: The dollar regains its upward momentum, and U.S. bond yields hit a new high in more than 12 years","&amp;#x200B;

The fundamentals are mainly bearish

\[US core durable goods orders surge in August\]

U.S. durable goods orders rose more than expected in August, suggesting businesses remained keen to invest in equipment despite rising interest rates, which could keep the economy on a moderate growth path.

\[US consumer confidence further rebounded in September\]

Consumer confidence rose for a second straight month in September, a survey showed, also quelling fears of a recession as a resilient labor market continued to create jobs at a rapid pace and sparked strong wage growth and lower gasoline prices. It also boosted consumer confidence. More consumers plan to buy big-ticket items such as motor vehicles and home appliances in the next six months, which should help support consumer spending.

\[U.S. new home sales surged 28.8% in August\]

Data from the U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed that U.S. new home sales rose 28.8% month-on-month in August, far exceeding expectations for a 2.2% decline, compared with a 12.6% decline in July. The month-on-month increase in new home sales in August was the second largest on record, following the 30.6% increase in June 2020. New home sales in August rose to an annualized rate of 685,000, the highest since March, and were expected to be 500,000, compared with 511,000 in July.

\[Fed's Bullard says U.S. economy remains resilient\]

St. Louis Fed President Bullard said on Tuesday that rapid U.S. interest rate hikes have heightened the risk of a recession, but this is likely to be caused by an external shock rather than a collapse of the U.S. economy, which remains resilient.

\[Fed official Kashkari: The Fed is committed to reducing inflation and restoring price stability\]

Fed official Kashkari said Fed policymakers are united in their commitment to lower inflation and restore price stability. The Fed's current pace of rate hikes is appropriately aggressive. The market understands the message released by the Fed in its September rate decision statement.

\[Survey: Fed rates will be higher than previously expected, more pain ahead\]

Economists polled by Reuters believe the Fed's key rate hike has reached a higher peak than forecast two weeks ago, and the final level of the federal funds rate may even be higher than currently expected.

\[The dollar is approaching a more than 20-year high again, and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond jumped to the highest in 12 and a half years\]

The U.S. dollar index bottomed out and rebounded on Tuesday. Although it fell 0.68% during the session, it was still very strong overall. It closed up 0.04% at 114.15, only slightly lower than the more than 20-year high of 116.68 set on Monday; subject to the hawkish speech of the Fed officials Promoted, the US dollar index regained its gains on Wednesday. As of 10:00, it currently rose 0.34% and traded at 114.54. It is expected to climb to a new high in the short term, which has greatly damaged the morale of gold bulls.

\[Russia said that part of the results of the Ukraine referendum showed that a majority of four regions voted in favor of joining Russia\]

Russian officials in the four occupied territories of Ukraine reported overwhelming votes in the referendum to join Russia. At the same time, the United States plans to pass a resolution at the United Nations condemning the referendum as a sham, while Moscow shrugs it off.

\[IMF: Britain's fiscal plan disrupted international financial markets\]

The International Monetary Fund warned Tuesday afternoon that the British government's massive tax cut plan could increase inequality and weaken the Bank of England's monetary policy.

\[U.S. corporate profit forecasts frequently raise alarms, Wall Street investors panic\]

Recent profit warnings from bellwether companies such as Ford Motor Co. may point to more challenges ahead for U.S. companies, and investors have grown wary and fearful at a time when stocks have been selling heavily.

\[The U.S. stock market is getting deeper and deeper in the bear market, and the S&amp;P 500 index hit the lowest closing level in nearly two years\]

U.S. stocks sank deeper into a bear market on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at its lowest level in nearly two years, as Fed policymakers showed a willingness to raise interest rates further, even risking a recession.

On the whole, the support provided by factors such as geopolitical situation worries, global economic recession fears and the sharp drop in US stocks is relatively fragile. The intensive hawkish speeches of Fed officials have helped the US dollar maintain its strength and increase its chances of further agitation. US bond yields It has also risen sharply. The morale of the gold bulls is very low, and the short-term gold price is still facing further downside risks.

MineHub Technologies (MHUB) Enters Agreement with Sumitomo," Today I want to discuss a new discovery of mine, MineHub Technologies (MHUB). They are an enterprise blockchain platform transforming the performance of global supply chains. What exactly does this mean?  Here are some details:

* MineHub connects the many parties involved in a physical commodity transaction in a digitally integrated workflow 
* Document sharing
* Collaboration on agreements
* All supply chain management needs

MHUB is the one-stop-shop for metal and mining supply chains, offering all of the necessary features for this industry, using up and coming blockchain tech. I found an informative interview that explains the intricacies with MHUB's CEO, Arnoud Star Busmann. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psono3b6v0Q) is the link

What grabbed my attention about MHUB was an announcement that they entered a commercial agreement with Sumitomo, one of Japan's largest corporations that deals in commodities trading amongst other endeavors. Here are the highlights:

* Sumitomo will subscribe to the MineHub platform and enterprise applications as a paying customer
* Sumitomo will  adopt the MineHub platform for its worldwide network of mining companies, smelters and service providers
* It is a long term agreement

To me, MHUB's agreement with Sumitomo signals that it has made its place in Asia, a critically important market for all things supply chain. They are currently sitting at an affordable $0.19 per share, due to the hammering of the current market.

Scenario Discussion,"Hello Again, everyone!

Hope you all are doing fine!

&amp;#x200B;

On days like these I struggle to decide whether I should short or go long.. I hope someone more experienced than me can shine some light into the darkness for me. Here is the thing:

&amp;#x200B;

Market first so:

&amp;#x200B;

[SPY 1D](https://preview.redd.it/u4mtdu3armq91.png?width=1754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f0129a4d09a2e54c2ae06087ee908a1c696b345)

&amp;#x200B;

On the daily, the market is in a overall downtrend, even though we might hit support at the current level. But nevertheless the thesis for the market is BEARISH.

Let's look at the M5 chart of the market:

&amp;#x200B;

[SPY M5](https://preview.redd.it/gzawl63nrmq91.png?width=1721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a54faa786c0d7acae0f9c98b10a7fe9a1612c73)

Since market open we left the support zone and rallied back up to the previous pivot high/resistance.

I, myself don't consider a trade in the first market hour. So one hour after market open, I see market rallied quite a bit and is above vwap and EMA3/8 holds.

So just looking at the market on M5 i would be BULLISH. So right now I have two contradicting thesis.  


WHAT NOW? AM I LOOKING FOR RS OR RW STOCKS??

I chose to stick to the larger daily thesis and found a trading opportunity:

&amp;#x200B;

[VFC 1D](https://preview.redd.it/b3p1mgw2tmq91.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd03646815d27a35d501041aec9829b696fdbd03)

Daily is overall bearish + RW on the daily chart

&amp;#x200B;

[VFC M5](https://preview.redd.it/gazqedz6tmq91.png?width=1874&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eb9d396e38b6268358e0d02d37685645bac95f4)

RW on the M5 as well and my other trading constraints were met so i took this short trade..

As of now I am in decent profit, even though SPY still rallies at this moment..

&amp;#x200B;

[VFC M5 few minutes later](https://preview.redd.it/w0d1i0kltmq91.png?width=1387&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8106f201d93922f3c29f573f08883aa1f69f0bf5)

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering ""How whould my trading day evolved when I looked out for RS stocks since market was so bullish on the M5?""

Netflix caught my attention:

RS on daily:

[NFLX 1D](https://preview.redd.it/9ywyo6q9vmq91.png?width=1560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c8d288ff769aab3dcee3ebe390099ba5adf6ac9)

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like going long on NFLX would have resultet in a better trade day with more reward. There are many stock out there today outperforming the SP500. 

&amp;#x200B;

SO MY ONE BIG QUESTION IS: 

SHOULD I STICK TO GOING LONG ONLY WHEN THE DAILY OF THE MARKET  IS BULLISH AND VICE VERSA WITH GOING SHORT OR SHOULD I ALLOW TRADES AGAINST THE OVERALL TREND WHEN MARKET RALLIES/TANKS ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY AGAINST ITS OWN MAJOR DIRECTION??  


I really hope someone can give me an insight on how to better handle those days!

Kind regards,

Finding the balance between investing in the stock market vs saving for a house?,"I've seen a few posts here and there in the sub regarding the topic, but none of them have really answered the question - how do you go about finding the balance between how much you decide to invest in the stock market versus saving for a house, especially as it fits into the FIRE mentality?

As my wife and I are now 30, we're looking into settling down a bit and hoping within the next decade we can front the downpayment for a home. I just got a new job in los angeles, where my parents live, and my wife and I will temporarily be moving in my with my parents to save a bit of money. My wife will be unemployed for the time being, and I will probably be making a slightly above average salary by LA standards. I was late to the FIRE game, and at 30, I finally have about a zero net worth, with my assets only slightly more than my student loan debt. I would like to max my 401k and roth IRA if possible, and then do I throw the rest into a savings account indefinitely until I can afford a house? Especially with the market down, it's also hard to not be tempted to double down and invest anything extra into a brokerage account, especially if buying a home is still 5+ years away.",Fire,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/xqdbo4/finding_the_balance_between_investing_in_the/,Advice Request,tofulollipop,xqdbo4,/r/Fire/comments/xqdbo4/finding_the_balance_between_investing_in_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fire/comments/xqdbo4/finding_the_balance_between_investing_in_the/,0,2022-09-28
2019 Called And They Want Their Lamar Jackson Back ‚Äì Fantasy Games Won (FGW) Week 3 Update,"*For an explanation on how FGW is calculated, go back to* [Week 1](https://byroncobalt.com/2022/09/14/i-have-been-sent-back-until-my-task-is-done-fantasy-games-won-fgw-week-1-2022/)*.*

*TL;DR: FGW is the number of games a player is likely to have won (or lost) for your fantasy team. For example, if a player scored so much that he increased an average team's chance of winning from 50% to 90%, and he was started 100% of the time, that's a FGW score of 0.4 (90% minus 50%). If he was started only half of the time, and an approximate replacement player would dropped the win percentage from 50% to 40%, that comes out to an FGW of 0.15 (50% of the +0.4, and 50% of the -0.1).*

This is an abbreviated version of my full post on my website here: [https://byroncobalt.com/2022/09/27/2019-called-and-they-want-their-lamar-jackson-back-fantasy-games-won-fgw-week-3-update/](https://byroncobalt.com/2022/09/27/2019-called-and-they-want-their-lamar-jackson-back-fantasy-games-won-fgw-week-3-update/)

The 2019 Lamar Jackson season was probably the last year you would see a major market inefficiency in evaluating rushing QBs.

Off the top of my head, the best mid-round fantasy picks of the last 20 years must go something like:

1. Cooper Kupp, 2021
2. Randy Moss, 2007
3. Lamar Jackson, 2019
4. Arian Foster, 2010
5. Josh Gordon, 2013

In 2020, everyone was ready for the next breakout, so Kyler Murray‚Äôs stock went up a bit. Jalen Hurts saw his stock up in 2021. I don‚Äôt have data handy to back this up, but I‚Äôm fairly certain the 2011 fantasy drafts would have had Ryan Tannehill-types above Jalen Hurts-types.

We get to see now if Contract Year Lamar Jackson is as good as Breakout Year Lamar Jackson. This will be fun.

&amp;#x200B;

[Especially for this guy. He got distracted grading homework during his draft and had Lamar auto-drafted for him.](https://preview.redd.it/elewff3ztlq91.jpg?width=5061&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8015d06f5883226b0fa8655cac2302818a360b88)

* Lamar and Mark Andrews turned out to be quite the stack this year. In my opinion, best stack since the Burger King Stacker. That was a really good burger. You could order it for a while after it left the menu.
* Maybe we‚Äôre not at the Terminator 3 phase of Derrick Henry‚Äôs career quite yet. Maybe Week 1 and 2 was  just a cheesy 13-year-old John Conner scene from Terminator 2.
* Maybe Cordarrelle Patterson really is like a 24 year old running back. Perhaps the late start as a true ballcarrier will have a Fred Jackson-like effect and he'll be an age outlier.
* Combine an inconsistent QB (Hurts) with a WR that depends on explosive plays (AJ Brown) and apparently you get consistency. That makes sense.
* What the Bills need is less Gabe Davis and more Gabriel Davis.
* Speaking of old favorites leaving the menu, Alvin Kamara is about to see a % started drop.
* In retrospect, deciding against naming the metric the ""How Much Allen Robinson Hurts Us Barometer"" wasn't such an obvious decision.
* Justin ‚ÄúJordan‚Äù Jefferson needs to go back to being just Justin. Or maybe I just curse players that I dad-name. If that's the case, Amari ‚ÄúAmani‚Äù Cooper is on shaky ground. (Yes, that actually happened Thursday night. I called him Amani Cooper.)

* So it appears that Quarterbacks were a great position to invest heavily in if you wanted to play Russian Roulette with your fantasy team. Heavy representation at the top and bottom of the list here.
* If you‚Äôre redrafting today, are you taking anyone above Cooper Kupp?
* Travis Kelce is sneaky really good again and deserving of a high pick, so far at least.
* I was a bit more nervous about Tyreek Hill this year than Jaylen Waddle, mainly because of how often we see receivers change teams and suddenly cannot seem to do anything. It obviously doesn‚Äôt happen with every move (see: AJ Brown), but the Peerless Price and Chad Ochocinco moves seem to be uncomfortably common. The willingness of the Chiefs to move on from him also smelled a bit off. Not to say Tyreek hasn‚Äôt been great, I just had Waddle bumped up a bit and Hill bumped down.
* Stupid kickers.
* My 2 year old told Grandmom to start Brandin Cooks over Brandon Aiyuk. It was a rough week for The Blue Cars. He also told her to name their team The Blue Cars.
* Some players experiencing the replacement factor ‚Äì Dak, Elijah Mitchell, Trey Lance.
* But there‚Äôs Allen Robinson! Though I highly doubt many people that owned him last year have him again this year.

Ryzen 7950X versus 5950X. Here's the real-world platform price-to-performance we are living in: ~51% higher price for ~45% higher multicore performance.,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I strongly welcome any corrections or improvements to my description of the pricing situation.

# How cold weather affects the human body:

We all experience cold weather differently. If you are tall, you tend to become cold faster than a shorter person. Taller people have a bigger surface area; meaning heat is lost from the body quicker. Even though people react to cold weather differently, as a species we are extremely adaptable.

What happens when we get cold? The human body has several defense mechanisms to try and boost our core temperature when it gets chilly. Our muscles shiver and teeth chatter. Our hairs rise and our flesh forms 'goosebumps' - a kind of evolutionary echo from the times when our ancestors were covered in fur. The hypothalamus, the gland in the brain that acts as your body's thermostat, stimulates these reactions to keep the body's vital organs warm, at least until it can find some kind of warmth and shelter.

The hypothalamus's mission is to keep the core warm at all costs - sacrificing the extremities if need be. That's why we feel pins and needles in our fingers and toes in extreme cold - the body is keeping its warm blood close to the center, constricting blood supply in the outer regions such as the end of our limbs. In extreme cold, and especially if bare skin is open to the elements, this effect can end in frostbite. Blood flow is reduced, and the lack of warm blood can lead to tissue freezing and rupturing.

Cold weather can put increased stress on our cardiovascular system. Cold temperatures cause your blood vessels to constrict, shallow breathing, and a slight thickening of the blood. These changes can cause chest pain in people with heart disease. When you're outside in cold conditions, make sure to wrap up warm, being careful to cover up your extremities.

Cold temperatures can cause problems for asthma sufferers. Cold, dry air causes the air passages in the lungs of some asthma sufferers to contract, making it difficult to breathe. When it comes to the cold, it is not just about being outside. It is important to understand that keeping your house warm during the winter months is essential.

Cold, dry air can also worsen conditions such as eczema by drying out the skin. Even if you may not feel like it, it's important to drink lots of water in the winter months in order to stay hydrated and avoid dry, flaky skin.

Therefore, use of a heater during the winter is a must.

My Teacher Banned Me For Being Too Good,"This is a stock market game in my high school class, we start with $100,000 of fake virtual money.

This screenshot was taken ab a week ago, since then I made 440%, (I forgot to screenshot cause I didn‚Äôt know I would be banned, but if u don‚Äôt believe me here is 309% in just over a week.) The day after I got a total of just over half a million, I walked into class, pulled up the stock market game, and found that my account was gone. I asked my teacher what happened, he said he banned me because I was cheating. I responded by saying how was I cheating, he said he didn‚Äôt know, I then said all I did was buy and sell in the most volatile stocks I could find. My teacher said ‚Äúin real life no one does that.‚Äù At this point I didn‚Äôt see a way of him understanding my position, so went on with my day trying not to confront him. I know that this trading strategy isn‚Äôt good in real life, and will most likely end up with loosing money, but this was a game; it was harmless and fun to see what I could do by trading in the most volatile stocks, and I don‚Äôt understand why my teacher deleted my account without talking to me about it.

is living worth the trouble?,"i went through a depressing period in 2017-2021. Those were the absolute worst years of my life. i was only 13 when i started smoking weed, and when my dad was around doing heroin. i loved him and i just wanted to make up the years lost. my mom and him divorced in 2010 two years after the stock market crash and he starting doing heroin to escape from my mom, which was why she divorced him.

my mom is pretty much fucking borderline psych ward material. she barely can even function normally  in society, and my sister just recently left a month ago at 21 years old. im 18. those four years left me destroyed. instead of highschool I did online, I never went out, never did anything, and it ruined me. i was so scared to even step outside alone.

Well. Here I am in 2022 and I have gotten so much better, i do go out, i help my mom, i work out everyday, I can socialize much better. I am currently just waiting for some of this weed to clear out of my system so when I get a job Ill pass any test they give me. Still scared to drive a bit, got my permit and only missed one question.

Everything is moving foward. But something just hurts inside. The start I have in my life makes me just want to die. My sister made it out normally, barely hanging on. and i just fucked myself, i was too weak. Its not too late, but i still just have no motivation some days. my mom is so stupid that she doesn‚Äôt have the mental capacity for being a parent.

Everyday, my thoughts never end. I insult myself, bring myself down, and then back up again. They never end. I think every second every moment. No wonder i stayed inside and just played games. i numb myself from my surroundings.

Guys, the weight of the world is too much. I hate thinking, and I just wish I could have a break; but the break will never come. Every waking moment is one where im succumbed by degrading thoughts abot myself. I compare myself to everyone, especially those I went to school with. Why couldn‚Äôt i start with a normal life? Why couldn‚Äôt my dad find another girl instead of my mom?

I tell myself its a lesson from the universe, or whoever created us, but I just dont fucking care at this point. I‚Äôve made do with what I have, but noone has been here to build me up, and im sick of it. Im sick of not having a mother who is worthy of being a parent. Im sick of my father doing what he did. im sick of being less than normal. Im sick of comparing myself to those who got a fair start in life.

Ive tried. and i dont know if I want to try anymore. and its funny because everyone thinks im fine and im changed, but the pain irks inside me all the time. no matter how much i accomplish. I just want to die. The only reason i haven‚Äôt fucking killed myself is pretty much my family. And there are things in life to enjoy, a good movie, beautiful music, stunning views, having a good time with family and friends, and whatever else you can think of. But I still just want to end it all. 

I am on the edge pretty often. I have told noone, and i dont know if anyone but me can change it. It‚Äôs not fair, and it never will be. It hurts to live, and im sorry we are all apart of it. Emotions are something that will always control you, including ones where you don‚Äôt want to participate in the game of life. Some stop themselves, some don‚Äôt die from their attempt, and some really do pass on.

I dont really know if i want to participate in this society. Work every day of my life, spend money on meaningless shit. Be a slave to a system that just wants to squeeze the life out of you while you‚Äôre alive and then your children after you‚Äôre dead. Im sure its a gross exaggeration, but who fucking cares.

Our government is corrupt, the planet is falling apart, everyone hates each-other, and we are losing the last humanity we have. I didn‚Äôt want to watch the world burn, let alone be burned with it. I hope you guys on this subreddit get out of depression, i‚Äôm sure there is something worth living for, but for now i‚Äôll ponder taping my mouth and nose shut, and silently die while my body clings onto the only resource i‚Äôll starve from it.

Bullish Market for Q4?,"In anticipation that Q4 will end the Bitcoin bear market, the price of BTC remains below $19K. Only after $2,000 of the BTC spot price has been erased are new losses stopped, and a rebound has not yet been seen.

As risk asset decline persisted overnight, Bitcoin (BTC) hit fresh weekly lows into September 28.

The trend changed in lockstep with the stock market, which first moved slightly upward at the opening of Wall Street before turning red.

Ultimately, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index ended the day with losses of 0.25 and gains of 0.25, respectively.

However, despite optimism that Q4 would usher in a more robust rebound, cryptocurrency failed to make up its losses, and traders were on the suffering lasting initially.

Il Capo of Crypto, a well-known Twitter user, seems to corroborate that he preferred October's performance to resemble last year's.

Rekt Capital, a fellow trader and analyst, on the other hand, called attention to the difficulties Bitcoin faced on monthly timescales. A closure below that green line, Rekt Capital continued, would signal a break from the monthly range that has been in place since late 2020.

Opinions on the application of data from prior halving cycles to the question of when the bear market of 2022 would conclude varied.

The STACKS Podcast's Luke Martin uploaded a comparison chart and highlighted that it had been 322 days since Bitcoin's last all-time high of $69,000.

BTC/USD entered a bear market 364 days after the last all-time high in 2017, indicating that the end could be approaching if history is any indication.

Others weren't as persuaded, the macro situation wasn't what it was in 2018. The US Federal Reserve has not indicated that it would stop raising interest rates this year, which is impacting risk assets like cryptocurrency.",u_SafelyPal,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SafelyPal/comments/xqal87/bullish_market_for_q4/,,SafelyPal,xqal87,/r/u_SafelyPal/comments/xqal87/bullish_market_for_q4/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SafelyPal/comments/xqal87/bullish_market_for_q4/,0,2022-09-28
"Hello, guys, I have written two versions of my common app personal essay. I wonder which one could be more appealing to the admission office?"," The 1st one(about 350 words):

   

 I think the most significant thing setting me apart from other applicants was the excellence of productivity that I derived from my well-owned ability of self-study, with the determination that helped me overcome seemingly unaccomplishable challenges. Although I left school due to severe bullying and was tortured by my family, my innate quality continues to illuminate and my passion to pursue truth and knowledge never ceased. I stick to my studies and continue to learn on my own, without much outside help. I continued to develop my English with my ability of self-study, gradually striving to improve my knowledge in every branch of the language. Some people might be surprised, but it's true: if you can learn a new skill from scratch using your own methodology, applying that learning method to other areas does not make much difference. That's the case when I apply this methodology to piano playing, an area I have never entered before. I learned to play some challenging Chopin etudes in less than 1.5 years. There's not a single exaggeration. It's really about acquiring a systematic methodology and keeping that in mind to become more productive. Productivity is what I regard as very crucial and valuable, and I achieved it with the methodology that I have gradually acquired through my previous self-learning experiences. I began to feel very comfortable switching between different areas since it doesn't take long for me to learn one area and eventually become an expert in it. After, I made $55000 on a sing stock trade, even though I had just entered and done research productively on this relatively new field, thanks to my willingness to learn to trade and my methods of learning new things all on my own as well. Lately, I have been applying my self-learning methodology to venture into the foreign exchange market. It also helped me finish two high school courses, HN Algebra II and Geometry, in 15 days. 

 It's all about the highly productive methodology that helped me obtain these skills to be a part of me with the determination I have developed over these years.

  The second one:

  Being a vigorous young man who has conducted unimaginable efforts toward my humble achievements at this moment, I would consider my intention for undergraduate study as another grindstone to polish my intrinsic talent while initiating my academic life in a formal pattern. More specifically, I admire the position of Mathematics as the ‚Äúfoundation of all scientific disciplines‚Äù, allowing me to either step further on the academic track or probe into cross-disciplinary areas like Accounting or Finance, strengthening my determination for the application. Besides, the global-leading reputation of Duke also implies admirable personal growth worthy of my pursuit.

Unlike the majority of students from Mainland China, I may easily present my growth track filled with toughness and challenges. I ceased my attendance at regular schools right after the 9-year compulsory education because of the severe on-campus bullying (a brutal fact tahat may still existi until now), and continued on my self-driven study ever since then, mainly by attending the online-based Excel High School. Despite the absence of any guidance or tutoring service for years, I may proudly announce my distinguished learning capability that supported my fast acquisition of high-school courses within less than one year (a rarely-noticed achievement for young students) and the brilliant GPAs maintained consistently. Besides, benefitting from the enriched academic resources in the online institute, I had my curriculum spanning multiple areas, e.g., the intensive discussions on Mathematical topics, a variety of language courses, and even certain Musical Art modules catering to my personal interest. I devoted all my diligence to acquire every tiny piece of knowledge while keeping the update of my learning methodologies, over-compensating the drawback of academic circumstances. It is fair to comment on such spirits as overwhelming to any other factors when determining the potential of students.

I‚Äôd like to specify a few milestones on my growth track in slightly more detail, as further endorsement of my competence. I may still recall the embarrassment at the beginning of my self-taught¬†English courses, when there was literally no formal educational material available to me. Instead, I immersed myself in radio broadcasts and kept making notes for myself for a long time before enjoying the dramatic improvement in my language skills until an affirmative score of 130 on the Duolingo test (IELTS 7.0 equivalent), with the learning methodologies applicable to even other languages like French. Similarly, when stepping into Computer Programming, I adopted a WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) scheme to split the mega-sized challenge into a list of accessible goals, facilitating my acquisition of 3 different programming languages in total (even ahead of my peers receiving their rigorous high school education). The most impressive, or even legendary trial for me by now, would be my learning of piano performance skills. Apart from the numerous practices I input just like the other musicians, I even encountered catastrophic incidents happening to my family (notorious land acquisition and forcible demolishing making us almost homeless, yet hardly retrievable on journalism reports) severely impeding my life. However, it was nothing but my persistence that supported me throughout the darkness and elaboration of my performance skills, from the fundamental finger movements to the exquisite Etudes from Chopin. I will have no hesitation to announce all facts as an addition to my overall quality.

There is also other evidence of my consciousness of comprehensive development, such as my ingenuity in music composition with appreciation from customers, my sensitivity to the stock market, and my ambitious proposal to start up a Software Company. Briefly, I am sincerely looking forward to a sublimation for myself with the elite education expectable from Duke, and once admitted, I will promise myself to approach the essence of Mathematics with nurturing from the academic soil. Eventually, the promising learning outcome shall be a critical stepstone for my future success.

[**Indian Women‚Äôs influence in the Cryptocurrency Investment**](https://blog.fanspel.com/best-cryptocurrency-investment-trading-platform/)

Cryptocurrency markets may be young compared to stock, commodity, and asset exchanges, but their trading activities are neither new nor unusual. Trading cryptocurrencies means you‚Äôre dealing with a less developed market, which makes it harder to predict and more susceptible to extreme price volatility.

Bank of England pivots and starts doing QE back,"LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Wednesday it  would start a temporary programme of bond purchases to stabilise the  market, and postpone the planned start of its gilt sale programme.

Below is the full text of the central bank's statement:

&gt;""This repricing has become more significant  in the past day ‚Äì and it is particularly affecting long-dated UK  government debt. Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen,  there would be a material risk to UK financial stability. This would  lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a  reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;""In  line with its financial stability objective, the Bank of England stands  ready to restore market functioning and reduce any risks from contagion  to credit conditions for UK households and businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;""To  achieve this, the Bank will carry out temporary purchases of long-dated  UK government bonds from 28 September. The purpose of these purchases  will be to restore orderly market conditions. The purchases will be  carried out on whatever scale is necessary to effect this outcome. The  operation will be fully indemnified by HM Treasury.  
&gt;  
&gt;""On  28 September, the Bank of England‚Äôs Financial Policy Committee noted  the risks to UK financial stability from dysfunction in the gilt market.  It recommended that action be taken, and welcomed the Bank‚Äôs plans for  temporary and targeted purchases in the gilt market on financial  stability grounds at an urgent pace.  
&gt;  
&gt;""These  purchases will be strictly time limited. They are intended to tackle a  specific problem in the long-dated government bond market. Auctions will  take place from today until 14 October. The purchases will be unwound  in a smooth and orderly fashion once risks to market functioning are  judged to have subsided.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Monetary  Policy Committee has been informed of these temporary and targeted  financial stability operations. This is in line with the Concordat  governing the MPC‚Äôs engagement with the Bank‚Äôs Executive regarding  balance sheet operations. As set out in the Governor‚Äôs statement on  Monday, the MPC will make a full assessment of recent macroeconomic  developments at its next scheduled meeting and act accordingly. The MPC  will not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to  return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in  line with its remit.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The MPC‚Äôs annual  target of an ¬£80bn stock reduction is unaffected and unchanged. In light  of current market conditions, the Bank‚Äôs Executive has postponed the  beginning of gilt sale operations that were due to commence next week.  The first gilt sale operations will take place on 31 October and proceed  thereafter.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Bank will shortly publish a market notice outlining operational details.""

"The most confusing investment terms explained, from IPO to ETF","According to CMC Markets' analysis of global Google search data, these are the top 15 stock market terms internet users want to understand¬†and what they mean.¬†

**ETF** (average monthly searches 103,000): ETF stands for exchange-traded fund. An ETF is an investment fund made up of multiple assets that can include stocks, commodities, bonds, or a mixture of investment types which are known as holdings. ETFs trade on an exchange like a stock does. ETFs are generally considered safer investments because they are less volatile than individual stocks.

Most are citing concerns of a recession due to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs aggressive tightening campaign. Fed officials this week have continued to acknowledge that some pain likely lies ahead for the US economy and job market as the central bank continues its campaign to beat back inflation.

Bank of England pivots and starts doing QE back,"LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Wednesday it  would start a temporary programme of bond purchases to stabilise the  market, and postpone the planned start of its gilt sale programme.

Below is the full text of the central bank's statement:

&gt;""This repricing has become more significant  in the past day ‚Äì and it is particularly affecting long-dated UK  government debt. Were dysfunction in this market to continue or worsen,  there would be a material risk to UK financial stability. This would  lead to an unwarranted tightening of financing conditions and a  reduction of the flow of credit to the real economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;""In  line with its financial stability objective, the Bank of England stands  ready to restore market functioning and reduce any risks from contagion  to credit conditions for UK households and businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;""To  achieve this, the Bank will carry out temporary purchases of long-dated  UK government bonds from 28 September. The purpose of these purchases  will be to restore orderly market conditions. The purchases will be  carried out on whatever scale is necessary to effect this outcome. The  operation will be fully indemnified by HM Treasury.  
&gt;  
&gt;""On  28 September, the Bank of England‚Äôs Financial Policy Committee noted  the risks to UK financial stability from dysfunction in the gilt market.  It recommended that action be taken, and welcomed the Bank‚Äôs plans for  temporary and targeted purchases in the gilt market on financial  stability grounds at an urgent pace.  
&gt;  
&gt;""These  purchases will be strictly time limited. They are intended to tackle a  specific problem in the long-dated government bond market. Auctions will  take place from today until 14 October. The purchases will be unwound  in a smooth and orderly fashion once risks to market functioning are  judged to have subsided.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Monetary  Policy Committee has been informed of these temporary and targeted  financial stability operations. This is in line with the Concordat  governing the MPC‚Äôs engagement with the Bank‚Äôs Executive regarding  balance sheet operations. As set out in the Governor‚Äôs statement on  Monday, the MPC will make a full assessment of recent macroeconomic  developments at its next scheduled meeting and act accordingly. The MPC  will not hesitate to change interest rates by as much as needed to  return inflation to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, in  line with its remit.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The MPC‚Äôs annual  target of an ¬£80bn stock reduction is unaffected and unchanged. In light  of current market conditions, the Bank‚Äôs Executive has postponed the  beginning of gilt sale operations that were due to commence next week.  The first gilt sale operations will take place on 31 October and proceed  thereafter.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The Bank will shortly publish a market notice outlining operational details.""

Buy the dip means to ""buy the dip"" when the price of a cryptocurrency or an asset falls sharply. The expression Buy the dip is very often found in the crypto world, but also in the stock market. In this context, the trader buys the asset downwards i.e. ""the dip"" instead of selling it back as many investors are tempted to do in a panic.",u_Ludovic54,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ludovic54/comments/xq8jpt/what_does_buy_the_dip_mean/,,Ludovic54,xq8jpt,/r/u_Ludovic54/comments/xq8jpt/what_does_buy_the_dip_mean/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ludovic54/comments/xq8jpt/what_does_buy_the_dip_mean/,0,2022-09-28

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Wednesday as traders struggle to find their footing after the S&amp;P 500 notched a fresh bear market low in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 57 points, or about 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures shed 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slid about 0.9%.
*****
&gt; Shares of Apple were down nearly 4% in premarket trading after a Bloomberg report, citing people familiar with the matter, said the tech company is ditching plans to increase new iPhone production after demand fell short of expectations.
*****
&gt; Stock futures pared earlier losses after the Bank of England said it would temporarily purchase long-dated UK government bonds in an effort to stabilize the plunging British pound. Sterling briefly popped on the news before trading 0.5% lower against the dollar at $1.0647.
*****
&gt; The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield gave back its initial gains after the announcement, last trading at about 3.93%. Earlier in the trading session, the benchmark rate broke above 4% for the first time since 2008.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a mixed session in which the S&amp;P 500 reached a new bear market low of 3,623.29 and posted its sixth straight day of losses, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a gain.
*****
&gt; Several technical metrics show that the stock market may be oversold, but some on Wall Street are worried that investors have not priced in an earnings slowdown and the impact of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes. The S&amp;P 500 breaking below its previous low is a key indicator for some that stocks still have further to fall.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre certainly not at the end of the road in terms of pricing in the full recessionary outcome. ‚Ä¶ We really need to get to dirt cheap valuations on equities, and we‚Äôre not quite there yet,‚Äù Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, said on Tuesday‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell.‚Äù

"9/28/2022 Daily Plays Oh Boy! AAPL not raising production on Iphone 14, things to come, BIIB Alzheimers trial, taking SAVA LLY , THO smashes 95 score, big buyback! RAD reports tomorrow morning, covered some IRTC puts at end of day yesterday, have more, Was bidding on 6 different puts and none filled","Good morning everyone. The Nasdaq was up over 200 yesterday. I knew it could not last, even if it was a 1 day rally, it was going to be a head fake. I am not a bear, I read reality. When the data tells me, and the market roars, I will roar too! I was up 300% in 2020 and 110% in 2021! I have not seen those kinds of gains since the 90s! I am up near 25% in 2022 without using much case because I have focused on puts all year! In April, I had 12 puts expire for 30,000. 2 weeks later those same puts were worth between 250-300,000! Stuff like SNAP 30 strike, CVNA 95 strike, BROS 50 strike‚Ä¶ It was a nightmare, and that is because I was right on everything and ran out of time‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

I have used the gains last couple of years to throw into my real estate. It is a losing venture short time. For the last 12-18 months I have spent 30 to 60K on renovations! Its absolutely insane. I will be closing on 2 more properties within 2 weeks. The bank just called me and let me know they received the appraisals. Unfortunately for me, I went into contract End of July on 2 properties with 1 seller, and it took 6 weeks for these appraisals. In general appraisals take 2-3 weeks. Problem‚Ä¶

September 9th I did ask my banker and my 25 year ARM \[Adjustable Rate Mortgage\] it adjusts every 5 years was 5.71‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I am scared to ask now, I believe it may be above 7. If so my total interest on just the difference is going to be near 150,000 if I don‚Äôt finance..

THAT IS JUST THE INTEREST DIFFERENCE IN 3 WEEKS!

150K divided by 25 years \[12 months \]

150,000 divided by 300 months, it will cost me 500 more because this f-cking appraisal! Yes, I will try and refinance, this is an ARM anyway, but rates wont be dropping for a while.

I do not put these properties in my name for liability reasons.. I had 2 tenants try and sue me within the last 6 months! 1 Case was thrown out last week by a tenant being evicted‚Ä¶ The other case was also in eviction but the case isn‚Äôt thrown out. When you put a property in an LLC you can no longer get a normal mortgage. You must do commercial, which is only an ARM. It sux but the risks of having 1 tenant sue me and try and get tons from me is something I will not risk‚Ä¶. In a commercial mortgage you can not lock in rates until 2-3 days before closing‚Ä¶ it works very different.. So imagine me late July, knowing for a fact that rates would fly, when the dumb market felt they would pause.. So dumb! I kept trying to pressure the bank for appraisal but this bank kept saying they only have 1 person to go out and do them.. just terrible, I offered double for the appraisal. The appraisal is costing me 2,500 but I offered 5,000 for a speedy appraisal. \[Rather than 500 more a month!\]‚Ä¶ If you get a mortgage with a bank they will only approve with an appraisal. My credit score is near 820, and my plan is to have over 100 properties by 2025 so there is no way I would buy them all with cash. I did plan on buying 4-5 more in 2023 and 5-7 in 2024. 10-15 in 2025 but if rates remain high‚Ä¶ I wont be getting 100 by end of 2025‚Ä¶ There is no way I am buying them in cash and I will be pausing with rates 7% or above‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

I had to get this out of my system my banker called me yesterday about 3PM and told me they finally got the appraisal. It was ordered August 9th!!!! I was told 4-5 weeks, hence September 9th I called right away to find out what was going on and I knew the rate was 5.71 for me.. I am very scared to ask now‚Ä¶ 500 more a month for 25 years! WTF! 

I have to try and not be emotional, but 6,000 a year because the appraisal took 3 extra weeks is not acceptable. I am in NYC and the bank is in CT.. When I see my banker in person at closing, I will have to lash out! HAVE TO!!! 

Anyway, many people do ask me about real estate, I guess a lot of people think this is an amazing endeavor. I started buying in 2017 and had to stop when the pandemic started. Eviction ban, before the pandemic you could make 8% a year, so for every 100K you can expect 8,000 after all costs.. Now prices are higher, labor is higher, rates are higher.. my areas people cant afford a large rent increase‚Ä¶. I will be negative for years.. but long term this will be great, short term tons of pain. My advice is if you are just getting in, check carefully the market and rental properties may not make sense right now, unless you are ok with losing money the first 3-5 years‚Ä¶. I didn‚Äôt lose anything prepandemic. Prices were way lower, rates were lower about 4.75-5. A 3 family property in good shape was about 250k, it is now 400, and the price has not come down at all. These are rental properties, maybe by 10,000‚Ä¶.

I covered some IRTC puts November 110 strike for 9.20. I was in 7 dollars. I still have 120 strike for 9. They are worth about 13.. I will cover soon. Always take profits. Last Friday SAVA was down to 38, I am in 30 strike SAVA puts November for 3.85‚Ä¶ I entered a premarket order for 6.50‚Ä¶ I was up a ton! Originally after entering I placed a sell 4.75‚Ä¶I cant blame myself for being greedy it gapped down 10! I lowered my sell from 6.50 to 6.25, 6 and finally 5.50.. But I could have and should have taken 6 the first 5 mins.. We can only learn and move on.

I still have 11 puts. When I am 25-50% I will take it.. even though I know the trend is down, there are close to 100 tickers that are high fliers, I am looking at daily‚Ä¶ I was bidding on puts on SNOW CHWY CALM TSLA APRN APPF CYBR ‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt get filled on any, I am not a hindsight trader, but did kind of suck. I will do the same bid on several and once I get to 15 puts pause‚Ä¶

If I start covering 3-5 a day, I will expand my put holdings to 20, 25, 30. 

The news on BIIB is good, but remember, buy on rumor, sell on news. I will be buying puts, RISKY! Just know that! I will be getting time and maybe 3,000. I have my SAVA puts, I would get more if 55-60‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The mighty AAPL isn‚Äôt upping supply on Iphone 14s, it can be a signal to the market.. Big earnings kick offs in about 2 ¬Ω weeks. As I said, the probability is very high that earnings will disappoint and will have to come down. THO smashes again, this is over and over again, maybe look at CWH they both do RVs. Before these earnings I still feel sage trade range Nasdaq 9,500-10,500, SP 3,300-3,600. I will adjust this according to numbers.. Any number above risk of fall. If you want to buy dips maybe Nasdaq 9,500, SP 3,300, we aren‚Äôt there, so no buying for me! RAD reports tomorrow morning. I do not want shares of anything. I may buy 1,500 worth of calls but with time, so even if it comes down I have time. The last earnings was fairly good. 

5 Trade Ideas: Careful out there! Trend is down

BIIB ‚Äì Is at 305 right now. This Bio Pharma has the whole ETF LABD down. There is risk, but I will take it, I will limit my risk by buying puts with time, I may watch LLY too

THO/CWH ‚Äì This market doesn‚Äôt care if you smash, THO did announce a nice big buyback, I will monitor, I wouldn‚Äôt buy shares, but maybe Calls, That report was tremendous! And they have been slamming! Nothing new here

RAD ‚Äì Some risks, but I wont put more than 1,500 on calls, and I will get a few months of time, earnings before the bell

APRN ‚Äì Stock hit 5.42 I was bidding on my January 5 strike.. retail pushing again, maybe I get filled today

CYBR ‚Äì 3 straight days I will be trying puts, since Monday, Let us see. I was trying January..

Buying new Heavy Equipment Versus Buying used Heavy Equipment | Equipment Planet Equipment," 

# Buying new Heavy Equipment Versus Buying used Heavy Equipment

 

**What are the tips when buying new heavy equipment and buying used heavy equipment? The decision between new and used heavy equipment is based on your specific situation and what is best for your organization. This encompasses both short- and long-term inventory requirements for equipment. Each purchasing option has advantages and disadvantages.**

**The good news is that you aren‚Äôt alone in assessing these options, and you aren‚Äôt alone in seeking information on the advantages of buying new or used equipment. The worldwide heavy equipment market is huge, and many business owners are faced with the difficult decision of whether to invest in new machinery or buy used machinery. The heavy equipment business generates about $192 billion in revenue each year around the world. The United States has a 21 percent share of the market, or $40.3 billion. Caterpillar¬Æ has the biggest market share in the United States.**

**Cashman Equipment in Nevada, for example, is a Cat¬Æ dealer who knows the heavy equipment business inside and out. With years of experience in the construction and mining equipment industries, we are uniquely qualified to assist companies like yours. We‚Äôll work with you to determine whether you should acquire brand new machinery or a good used machine.**

**Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each option can be quite beneficial in providing you with accurate and practical information. After all, we understand how difficult it is to make a decision, which is why we stock both new and used Cat equipment. Finally, it‚Äôs your decision, and we want to make sure you‚Äôre making the best one possible.**

## Advantages of Purchasing New Heavy Equipment

**In an ideal world, when money is no object, you would almost certainly purchase brand new heavy construction or mining equipment. You consider your company‚Äôs image and the professional impression you make by operating a new fleet that is gleaming and trouble-free. You‚Äôd have access to the most up-to-date technologies, as well as the ‚Äúnew equipment smell.‚Äù Here are some more reasons to buy new equipment:**

* **New machines are significantly less likely to cause you problems when it comes to operation.** **Routine maintenance expenditures are an inevitable aspect of owning heavy equipment, but your repair costs will be far lower, and for a much longer period of time, if you purchase new heavy equipment. For this reason alone, purchasing new machinery makes sense in order to maximize output while avoiding the risk of a failure and costly repairs. A fresh machine will start in the morning and work without complaint for the rest of the day. You can also rely on a warranty backup if something goes wrong unexpectedly.**
* **Warranty:** **While all new machines come with a warranty, not other manufacturers provide the complete and comprehensive warranty package that Cat provides. You can rest easy knowing that your Cat OEM Solutions Warranty is the finest in the heavy equipment business.**
* **Technology:** **Major technology developments in heavy equipment engineering and design occur on a regular basis. You will receive the most up-to-date high-tech developments when you purchase a new equipment. Used machinery is rarely equipped with the same ‚Äúlatest and best‚Äù features as new machinery. Compare the latest safety and comfort features found in today‚Äôs new Cat equipment, including telehandlers, wheel loaders, and used machines only a few years old. There is no substitute for new equipment‚Äôs superior technology.**
* **You get exactly what you want when you buy modern heavy construction equipment.** **Heavy equipment design and manufacturing skills are always improving, resulting in new models that outperform and execute tasks that previous machines can‚Äôt. Cat offers a diverse range of equipment, from little compact track loaders to massive scrapers and off-highway trucks.**
* **Tax benefits:** **Purchasing new machinery is a capital asset investment. As a result, the IRS permits you to deduct or write-off certain sums related to the purchase price of new equipment. Your machinery becomes a corporate asset, allowing you to take advantage of tax benefits. These tax savings could be a significant capital offset, making buying new fully worthwhile.

## The Drawbacks of Purchasing New Heavy Equipment

**While there are numerous advantages to purchasing new and perfect heavy equipment, there are also some disadvantages. Let‚Äôs look at the opposing viewpoint to ensure you‚Äôre on the correct track and making an informed conclusion. If you‚Äôre serious about buying brand new heavy construction machines, here are some drawbacks to consider:**

* **New construction equipment comes with a hefty price tag. Some landscaping equipment, such as skid steer loaders, is reasonably inexpensive, but road-building equipment, such as articulated trucks, asphalt pavers, and vibrating drum compactors, is a large-ticket item that requires a significant capital outlay. You‚Äôll need to arrange financing if you can‚Äôt pay the full amount up front, which means you‚Äôll spend even more in interest and fees.**
* **Depreciation: It‚Äôs an unfortunate fact that new construction equipment depreciates far more quickly than secondhand equipment. Although there is no universal depreciation rate, your accountant will tell you that the resale value of new equipment drops faster in the first few years after purchase than in the middle and latter years of its life. The combination of harsh depreciation and an urgent capital expense may be more of a financial strain than you‚Äôre willing to bear. Another item to discuss with your accountant before purchasing new heavy equipment is depreciation.**
* **Purchasing new heavy construction or mining equipment is an investment with a return on investment. And you have to think about the return on your investment whenever you make one. When buying new, you may be compromising your overall return on investment by losing resale value due to depreciation and having your working capital tied up. This decision is based on your personal experience as well as advice from people you trust, such as your financial support team and equipment dealer. Finally, you‚Äôll have to consider if the potential loss of an investment return is a significant factor in your decision to buy new.**
* **Another disadvantage affecting the new-purchase decision is availability. It‚Äôs one thing to browse the Cat store and be enticed by the vast array of machines like drills and draglines, as well as useful attachments like augers, backhoes, and brooms. Getting them in a decent amount of time could be something entirely other. Many new pieces of equipment are posted for sale, but they do not yet exist. Specialty items aren‚Äôt always in stock and must be ordered and then built. This could be months between when you decide to acquire new equipment and when it arrives. When you have to work, that could be an unacceptable time gap.**

## Advantages of Purchasing Used Heavy Equipment

* **The secondhand heavy equipment market in America is alive and well, due to a large inventory of high-quality machinery from leading manufacturers like Cat. Even if you prefer new heavy construction or mining equipment, there are some advantages to purchasing secondhand that you simply cannot overlook. In the used Cat market, there are many great bargains to be found. Here are some of the most compelling reasons to consider purchasing old heavy equipment:**
* **Lower upfront costs: Buying used construction or mining equipment is less expensive than buying new, and in many circumstances, secondhand heavy equipment will generate the same amount of revenue for a fraction of the cost of new equipment. You could be better off putting the difference aside and reinvesting it elsewhere in your company. You may even be able to buy numerous used machines for the same price as a single new machine, allowing you to expand your fleet more quickly and complete more work.**
* **Depreciation is avoided: Depreciation on new equipment may be a big pain. Depreciation is unavoidable, but if you buy a used computer, someone else has already paid the high original cost. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a little skid steer or a large excavator, secondhand heavy equipment will not depreciate as quickly as new equipment, especially if you maintain it properly.**
* **Because used equipment does not degrade as quickly as new equipment, it retains its value, especially provided regular maintenance is performed. When it‚Äôs time to upgrade, you‚Äôll have a far better chance of recouping your investment by selling secondhand equipment for close to what you spent for it.**
* **Greater selection: Used heavy equipment, ranging from boom lifts and backhoes to industrial loaders and compactors, is available nationwide. Thousands of used machines are available, ranging from older machines that can accomplish basic tasks to last year‚Äôs models that are likely as excellent as new at a fraction of the price. You‚Äôll have a good chance of finding what you need if you shop the used machine market. You won‚Äôt have to wait months for your machine to be manufactured, and you‚Äôll be able to obtain it when you need it. Flexibility can make the difference between putting a used machine to work immediately versus waiting for the inflexible luxury of new.**
* **Lower insurance costs: This is a benefit of secondhand equipment that you may not have considered. Because the value of your heavy equipment will be lower with a used machine, your insurance premiums will be reduced. Even if the machine is suffering typical depreciation, new equipment insurance will assess replacement cost at the new machine value. With a new machine, you‚Äôll almost certainly overpay for insurance, whereas a used model would have its premium lowered.**

## The Drawbacks of Purchasing Used Heavy Equipment

**‚ÄúBuyer beware‚Äù is the best piece of secondhand equipment advise we can provide you. If you‚Äôre thinking about buying old heavy gear, make sure you do your homework and know exactly what you‚Äôre getting. You must also know from whom you are purchasing it. The following are some of the drawbacks of purchasing used heavy equipment from unlicensed sources:**

* **Stolen equipment: As with any sector, there are some shady companies out there selling heavy machinery. Some of it has definitely been stolen, which will give you far more distress than you can imagine. You must also be concerned about machine liens and the possibility of repossession. When you acquire used equipment from a respected dealer like Cashman, you don‚Äôt have to worry about any of the machines in the inventory being ‚Äúhot‚Äù or ‚Äúsought.‚Äù**
* **Bad condition: Be careful of the state of a used piece of equipment. You might be mechanically inclined or have a buddy who is a competent mechanic who can inspect the equipment before you buy it. However, working with an approved, reputable dealer with a reputation for honesty is the greatest way to get true confidence regarding a machine‚Äôs condition.**
* **Without a complete maintenance record and product history, you can‚Äôt truly tell if the used equipment you‚Äôre looking at is safe. You can end up with a machine that could cause property damage or possibly injure someone unless you buy from an approved equipment vendor with a true safety conscience.**

What are swaps in the financial markets?,"**A swap is a derivative contract through which two parties exchange the cash flows or liabilities from two different financial instruments.** 

It is an over-the-counter agreement between two companies to exchange cash flows in the future. The agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way in which they are to be calculated. 

The most common type of swap is a ‚Äò‚Äòplain vanilla‚Äô‚Äô interest rate swap. 

**Let us make it easier.** 

Suppose company A took a loan of 1 cr from the bank at a floating rate of interest (interest rate will vary according to the market). Currently, the interest rate being paid is 5%. The company feels that the rates might go up in near future and enters into a swap contract with another company B. Company A will now pay a fixed interest rate of 5% to company B and in return company B will pay the floating rate of interest to the bank. 

\- If the rate of interest goes up and more than 5 %, Company A will be at a profit. 

\- If it goes down company B will make a profit.

Imagine going on TV and telling people to sell into an oncoming recession which you go on to say is inevitable AND you expect people to take you seriously as a potential Treasury Secretary. You can't make this shit up!,"That is the worst advice you could give anyone.

I'm not a financial advisor, and this isn't financial advice. But I think it's fairly common knowledge that the best time to buy IS A RECESSION/DEPRESSION, it's when everything is massively discounted. Many new millionaires were minted off the 2008 bounce ([source from 2013](https://www.nmgcapitalgroup.com/stock-market-rally-means-400000-new-millionaires/))

Plus if a massive selloff were to happen at his behest, wouldn't that just make the recession/depression worse? You want people BUYING with market confidence to prevent a recession/depression, no?

He's trying to portray himself as the caring father figure while telling retail to sell him all their stuff at a massive discount that he orchestrated and risking the global economy in the process! Talk about snake oil, sheesh! Nevermind this all belies the true motivation which is to rescue himself and his SHF fuckbois from the FTD avalanche that is inevitable which created this whole problem in the first place.

The level of unchecked greed these people have enjoyed has made them absolutely delusional and confident they can get away with most blatant evil shit.

HOUSTON, Sept. 29, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via InvestorWire -- BlockQuarry Corp, (OTC: BLQC) (‚ÄúBlockQuarry‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a Texas-based company with commercial-stage operations in cryptocurrency mine hosting and self-mining in the Southeast United States, is pleased to update current and prospective shareholders on provisional and unaudited Q3 performance projections as well as highlights from its financial performance for the three months ended June 30, 2022.

‚ÄúWe had a fantastic 2021, but we believe 2022 is on pace to significantly raise the bar,‚Äù said Alonzo Pierce, President and Chair of BlockQuarry. ‚ÄúOur hosting revenue this year has already surpassed what we produced from that segment for the whole year in 2021. Moreover, due to our market positioning and signed agreements with major partners, 2022 appears set to be our best year ever on both the top and bottom line, with Q3 on pace to show strong growth on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, and we are excited to further bolster our positioning and performance trajectory into year end.‚Äù

Management believes the Company is on pace for top-line sequential quarterly growth during the three months ending Sept. 30, 2022, of roughly 30%.  


*Highlights for the three months ended June 30, 2022*

* Revenue exceeded $1.5 million for Q2, up almost 8,000% YOY.
* Total assets increased to nearly $11 million, up nearly 6,000%.
* Debt reduction from liabilities over $2 million in Q2.
* Shareholder base of over 7,000 shareholders &amp; a float of 47 million shares.
* Low break-even bitcoin mining cost and significant hosting agreements, which allow protection from bitcoin price volatility.

Management also notes that the Company has been fully engaged in the process of responding to SEC comments for the confidential filing of Form S-1.

Despite recent weakness in cryptocurrency related assets and market tone, the Company continues to see another year of very strong growth in 2022 as its hybrid mining and hosting model continues to scale up.

The Company‚Äôs long-term focus includes:

* Strong financial performance with quarter over quarter growth.
* Dedication to net zero carbon mining &amp; infrastructure solutions.
* A diverse long-term strategy branching within the energy &amp; infrastructure industries.¬†

Pierce added, ‚ÄúGiven our substantial hosting footprint, our long-term trajectory toward accelerating top-line growth is not contingent on price trends in the cryptocurrency market as we scale our operations. In other words, the price of Bitcoin has no bearing on our financial performance in our hosting business. As a result, we believe our stock price no longer reflects our fundamental value proposition for our shareholders following the recent period of significant weakness in cryptocurrency related assets.‚Äù

Pierce concluded, ‚ÄúGiven our hybrid model, our lack of toxic financing on the balance sheet, and our current partnerships and agreements with strong-handed players in the space, we believe we are positioned to thrive over the long term.‚Äù

=&gt; **This would double the annual uranium demand from USA!!!** And a massive build out starting \~2030 would mean that the needed uranium for this will need to be signed in contracts with uranium producers around 2025!!!

\- China is massively building new reactors: "" China had 53 nuclear plants at the end of 2021 with a total generating  capacity of 55GW. The country plans to expand this to 70GW by 2025 and  up to 150GW by 2030, at which point it is likely to become the world‚Äôs  largest generator of nuclear energy, ahead of the US and France."" (September 27, 2022)

=&gt; **China today consumes \~28 Mlbs of uranium in 2022, that's 20% of global uranium production (\~135MLbs in 2022). Based on the uranium needs for consumption and the uranium needed for first cores of nw chinese reactors, the total uranium demand of China will be \~50Mlb in 2025 (for 2027 consumption) and 110Mlb in 2033 (for 2035 consumption)!!!**

But India, Turkey, Egypt, ... are also building new reactors that also need a 1ste core and than 40-80y of core reloads!

&amp;#x200B;

**2) The supply side**

**In 2022 the global uranium production will only reach 135Mlbs.** And only with a significant higher uranium price in Q42022 than today, the uranium sector could maybe reach 155Mlbs global production in 2023.

But the annual demand today is around 200Mlbs which reduces operational inventories of producers, convertors and end-users (utilities). 

Those operational inventories are now at a critical low leverl according to UxC, meaning that there isn't room anymore to reduce operational inventories further. So now utilities effectively need to find \~200Mlbs in the market!! But where??

&amp;#x200B;

Today the uranium spotprice is around 48USD/lb, while the uranium sector needs 80USD/lb to increase production to be able to get global uranium supply and demand in equilibrium again a couple years after reching those 80 USD/lb.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes the time that this will be translated in much higher upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket. 

And because the natural uranium cost only represents \~5% of total production cost of electricity from a nuclear reactor, they will not mind to buy uranium above 100 USD/lb if needed, because the cost of shutting the reactor down due to fuel shortage will cost so much more for the utility.

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion: The uranium price is about to increase significantly

### How does Ignite Drops Work On Your Health?

According to the official website of the supplement, it is very difficult for people above the age of 35 to lose weight because a hormone, BAM15, which is essential for weight loss, becomes dormant.

### Ignite Drops Ingredients

Ignite Drops contains many metabolism-boosting ingredients that can enhance your overall health to a great extent. The formulation of this supplement contains only natural flavors and natural antioxidants to support your well-being.

[Let‚Äôs take a close look at the ingredients](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2F4abae4m3fpax0v8tenmlta1vct.hop.clickbank.net%2F%3Ftid%3DREDD&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw0l0cazCO7PtW2RD9amJstL) of the supplement and how they contribute to the working of Ignite Drops.

### Forskohlii Root

Forskolin is a compound found in the roots of Forsythia suspensa. It is often marketed as a dietary supplement because it appears to improve blood flow throughout the body.

One study published in the Journal Internal Medicine found that people who took a standardized dose (\~150 mg) of forskolin twice per day for four days experienced increased levels of nitric oxide in their blood. Nitric oxide plays a key role in increasing blood flow throughout the body, including to muscles.

Because of this, it's possible that forskolin could help increase the ability of muscles to use glucose during exercise. This would allow them to perform at a higher level for longer periods of time without getting tired.

It is one of the most effective natural ingredients in the Ignite Drops composition. It can help curb your appetite and suppress your hunger to a great extent.

### Gymnema Leaf

Gynmema leaf extract is a popular favorite in weight loss supplements. It contains antioxidants that can reduce oxidative stress on your body and promote weight loss naturally.

Gymnema Sylvestre is a natural herb that has been used for centuries in India to help with weight loss. It‚Äôs also known as the ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Apple,‚Äù because of its shape. The leaves are greenish-yellow in color and have a bitter taste. They grow on trees native to India and Sri Lanka.

The plant contains gymnemic acid which helps suppress appetite. This makes it an effective treatment for obesity. However, it should be taken under medical supervision.

Gymnema sylvestre works by suppressing your appetite. When you eat something sweet or fatty, your body releases insulin into your bloodstream. Insulin tells your brain that you‚Äôve eaten enough food and stops you from eating more.

However, when you take the extract of this plant, it suppresses your appetite so much that it prevents your body from releasing insulin. As a result, you feel full even after consuming small amounts of food.

This means that you won‚Äôt overeat and will lose weight.

### Green Tea Leaf Extract

Green tea can help you to shed layers of body weight in no time. It can provide you with multiple health benefits as well. When you consume green tea extract, you support healthy cholesterol and sugar levels in your body.

Green tea is one of the most popular drinks in the world. People drink it for many reasons: to stay healthy, to reduce their risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and other health problems.

But did you know that drinking green tea can actually help you lose weight? Green tea contains catechins, powerful antioxidants that may help boost metabolism and burn fat.

A study at Wake Forest University found that people who drank four cups of green tea per day lost about 2 pounds over 12 weeks. Another study published in the Journal of Nutrition showed that obese women who consumed two cups of green tea daily had lower levels of belly fat than those who didn‚Äôt consume any green tea.

Another study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition revealed that overweight adults who took green tea supplements experienced significant reductions in waist circumference and total body mass index (BMI).

Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine studied nearly 1,000 men and women between 18 and 75 years old. All participants were asked to keep track of everything they ate and how much physical activity they engaged in each week.

After analyzing the data, researchers concluded that coffee drinkers burned about 30 calories more per day than non-coffee drinkers. In addition, the amount of time spent sitting was significantly shorter among coffee drinkers compared to non-coffee drinkers, suggesting that coffee helped them get up and move around more throughout the day.

In fact, some experts believe that caffeine could be responsible for up to 10 percent of all dieters‚Äô success. That‚Äôs why if you want to lose weight, you might consider adding a cup of coffee to your morning routine.

### Grapeseed Extract

Various studies have linked the consumption of grapeseed extract with reduced weight. It can enhance your metabolic rate so that you can sustain high energy levels whilst losing weight.

Grape seeds contain high levels of fiber and Vitamin K, both of which promote satiety. Grape seed extract has also been shown to increase thermogenesis, which means that it increases energy expenditure.

One study conducted at the University of Michigan Medical Center involved 40 overweight adults who followed either a low-fat diet or a grape seed extract supplement for eight weeks. After following these diets, researchers discovered that the group taking the supplement lost twice as much weight as the group on the low-fat diet.

Another study published at the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that obese individuals who took a grape seed extract supplement experienced improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides.

The active ingredient in grapeseed extract is called procyanidin B2. This compound helps to block an enzyme called phosphodiesterase, which breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in cells. When this happens, cAMP accumulates inside the cell, causing it to become more sensitive to insulin.

This leads to increased glucose uptake by muscle tissue and decreased glucose output from liver cells. As a result, less sugar enters the bloodstream, which causes blood sugar levels to drop.

Because of its ability to improve insulin sensitivity, grapeseed extract has been used to treat type II diabetes. It works by increasing the number of receptors on the surface of insulin-sensitive tissues such as muscles and adipose tissue.

When taken regularly, grapeseed extract can help reduce fat storage in the body. The reason for this is because it stimulates lipolysis, which is the breakdown of stored fats into free fatty acids. These fatty acids are then transported out of the cell and into the bloodstream where they can be used as fuel.

Although there have not been any serious side effects associated with consuming grapeseed extract, it may cause stomach upset when consumed in large amounts. If you experience nausea or diarrhea after taking the supplement, stop using it immediately and consult your doctor.

### Capsicum Annuum Fruit

Cayenne is another popular ingredient used in weight loss supplements. It can burn your fat cells and provide other health benefits to your body like improved liver health and reduced inflammation.

Capsicum contains capsaicin, a chemical compound that has been linked with increased thermogenesis. When you eat chili peppers, your body breaks down the capsaicin into another substance called dihydrocapsaicin. Dihydrocapsaicin then stimulates the release of norepinephrine, a hormone that causes the body to burn calories.

A study published in the International Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism found that when subjects ate a meal containing hot pepper sauce before exercising on a treadmill, they burned about 50 percent more calories than those who didn't eat any food beforehand.

### Panax Ginseng Root

Panax ginseng is another herb that has been studied extensively for its potential to boost metabolism and burn fat. One study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology found that people who took panax ginseng supplements had higher resting metabolic rates than those who did not take the supplement.

A second study published in the journal Obesity found that men who took a standardized dose of Panax ginseng daily for 12 weeks lost nearly two pounds more than a placebo group.

What makes Panax ginseng so effective is that it contains several compounds called saponins. Saponins are believed to stimulate the release of thyroid hormones, which play a key role in regulating metabolism.

Saponins also appear to inhibit the activity of enzymes that break down carbohydrates. Because of this, they may increase the amount of glycogen stored in the liver. Glycogen is a form of carbohydrate that stores energy in the body.

Saponins are also thought to promote the growth of new mitochondria, which are structures within cells that produce energy. In addition, saponins have been shown to increase the rate of oxygen consumption in skeletal muscle cells.

In one study, researchers gave healthy volunteers either a placebo or a standardized dose of Panax ginseng every day for three months. At the end of the trial, participants who took the supplement had significantly greater lean mass and lower body fat percentages compared to those who received the placebo.

Other studies have found similar results. For example, a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that women who took a standardized dose (1 gram) of Panax ginsenosides daily for six weeks experienced significant increases in their resting metabolic rate.

The same study also found that women who took the supplement experienced an average weight loss of 1.6 pounds over the course of the trial.

Another study published in the European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology found that obese women who took a standardized dosage of Panax ginseng for eight weeks experienced significant decreases in both abdominal and total body fat.

It is often used in health supplements to promote male sexual health. Ginseng can allow you to lose weight by supporting your hormonal balance.

"9/29/2022 Daily Plays, Market rallied Window dressing? Or so I can open 3 fresh puts? AAPL negative news 7.5% of SP, and we rally?! KMX horrible report, RAD a 60, JEF beats lowered guidance, See a sign? What do you foresee in 2 weeks? Keep rallying APRN I want different strike Puts, BBBY Crash LOL","Good morning everyone. There is pent up demand to rally. There is cash from ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù on the sidelines when data gets better. ‚ÄúAPEs‚Äù are buying dips. Most of the money is made after a crash, immediately after. In 2009 I was up about 100% and in 2020 I was up 300%. This is only because I was in 70-75% cash with money to deploy when I saw the coast was clear. If I was in 100% stocks I would have had to pray, and wait for things to get better. When I sold everything in 2000, the 1 and only true crash in history, Nasdaq down 83%, I repeat that because if you been thru it and were a day trader, you absolutely learned, as long as you wanted to absorb, I was in 120-300% regularly! I was in heavy margin, almost always.. I had as much as 5x buying power, and I would use it to do wild things. In 2021 because the market was a shooting star I got as high as 80% stocks.. But remember late 2020 and early 2021, all the data was incredible. Free trading, locked .125% rate, earnings slamming, and no fear with retail, they would bid up everything.

That is because the Nasdaq crashed from 10,000 to 6,000 and shot to 16,200. We are no where near that scenario. In early 2021, I had a ton of $LL and $Woof because there wasn‚Äôt much to fear, they rocked earnings, and retail was behind me. I had over 300K in each at 1 time.. I believe I had almost 500K in $WOOF ! I was scared but it was after a monster beat.. Now, I don‚Äôt want to buy any shares.. My last shares, I got 500 ZIM 39.75, 200 CRMT 94.40, 500 ECPG 61.75 . It is dangerous to buy shares of anything. We do not have the backdrop that we once had. I prefer to buy options where I limit orders to 2-3,000 and wait for better horizons. I will make a ton after this is done, but while it falls, I will make something at least. I am not buying dips! I was buying dips on cash cows, dividend payers about a month ago‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ things turned very south with that CPI and Fed meeting.. We are assured that we will see 1.0% more hike if not 1.25 by years end.. We are also assured it wont be lowered for quite some time, even if we lose jobs, have more negative gdp.. Why we rallied? As I have said before 90-95% of the stock market can not make money in a down market, that includes money managers, hedge fund traders, so on any bit of news they will try and run! I have learned over 20 years ago don‚Äôt buy dips!

I rarely every buy more than 2 blocks of any company‚Ä¶ I do but rarely‚Ä¶ I have 3 blocks of ZIM avg of 46‚Ä¶ They will pay me cash while I HODL. It does suck though.

The back drop of AAPL not raising production. 7.5% of the SP500, the most important stock in the world, and we rally big‚Ä¶ Is pretty dumb to me‚Ä¶ This doesn‚Äôt mean 100% that AAPL will miss, but the probability of a grim future is higher now‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt buy or short AAPL short term. Long term the company is very innovative and have adapted many times, which is why long term you will be fine, short term there is pain.. However, if we are trading, and the largest most important company, which normally raises production when a new phone is introduced, doesn‚Äôt.. That is definitely signs. Is it better or worse that AAPL raises or lowers production.. If raise it rallies, lowers it falls‚Ä¶ AAPL is a barometer not just for the stock market, but as a global indicator like FDX.. AAPL has its money into everything, they have the cash to ramp up supply and wait for demand‚Ä¶ the fact that they don‚Äôt want to oversupply means they are worried about demand‚Ä¶ I would definitely worry! I don‚Äôt need to, heck I am in about 75% cash.. and you?

Unfortunately, I may not be able to deploy this cash for 3-6-9 months‚Ä¶ because I wont be going in strong until rates stop rising, probably near 4.5-5%, earnings stops falling, and GDP levels.. I don‚Äôt know exactly when that is, but I promise, I will see it first, as I am reading the indicators and trying to teach you all.

Late 2020 KMX was slamming earnings.. Man this was a powerhouse cash cow, LAD. Both sell cars, I was trading them both like crazy, stopped trading KMX near 120 it flew to near 160! Now its 70 premarket! Earnings off a cliff! LAD 70 to 150‚Ä¶ I made my money trading banks and cash cows.. not tech, speculative stocks‚Ä¶ This may be a bad sign KMX on LAD‚Ä¶ but it is hard to find it in myself to short companies with PE ratios under 10‚Ä¶ LAD is near 6, KMX near 12‚Ä¶..however you can see as earnings comes down so will the multiples.. I will stay away from both.

I rather short stuff with a zillion pe \[meaning they don‚Äôt make money now and no time soon\] wait for apes to wake up or get slaughtered. I have APRN puts January 4.50 strike for 1.30.. Let it rally I am happy to buy higher strike. This company is a disaster, there is a reason it is near 70% short. I understand the Apes do not care, and they want to try and force a short squeeze but I will buy puts with time and wait. I have traded January APRN puts maybe 5x.. Each time for 400-700 dollars. My first trade on APRN was with about 2,000. So I have made 2,500+ on ‚ÄúAPES‚Äù pumping APRN, so I should actually be thankful.. I opened WING December 110 strike at 5.90.. I sold these just days ago at 7.60‚Ä¶.. I sold IRTC November 110 strike puts at 9.20 and bought them back yesterday at 7.20! 600 bucks! Im only investing 2,000! Screen shots of all 3 on Twitter. So that is fine by me‚Ä¶I have 14 puts, I may open 1-2 more puts and wait.. if the market doesn‚Äôt come off hard now, wait for earnings kick off around October 15th‚Ä¶.

I was trying RAD calls 8 strike November and January. I didn‚Äôt get filled on either. Each was about 1,500. RAD missed bottom line by about 9 million dollars, but because it is just 55 million shares a miss by 15 cents, sounds awful until you realize they missed by 9 cents! When you have 600 million shares like RBLX and miss by 10 cents, 60 million dollars, when your sales are 400 million that‚Äôs bad! RAD had sales of 5.9 billion and missed by 9 million. They lost in total 30 million! It just looks bad because they only have 55 million shares.. GAAP loss was bad because the closing of stores‚Ä¶ JEF had good earnings because guidance was lowered, but the earnings and sales were a huge drop year over year, so I cant give it a 95‚Ä¶ I will give it an 80 because they beat lowered guidance.. What I do like is JEF has an 85 on financials and is doing a buyback‚Ä¶. BBBY sales off a cliff! Down 33% from a year ago. They lost 366 million on 1.44 billion in sales‚Ä¶. Last year they had nearly 2 billion in sales and lost 73 million.

Tell me, less sales and more losses. 

Is that good? Bad?

Hello GME apes!

That is a formula for disaster, of course it is short heavy! Did you just read what I wrote. I hope it rallies, please 7.50+ for puts

Even if they borrow money they cant stop the inevitable, same goes for GME and same goes for AMC.

You can not keep losing money and have no sales.. Eventually you will dilute shareholders to infinity or take out loans that you cant pay back..

By the way, the moment you cant pay back, even 1 dollar, you legally have to announce bankruptcy! Check the law! So as a shareholder of these bags, do you want heavier bags or a company you trade to be 0?

I heard a lot of complaints about ‚ÄúAPE‚Äù‚Ä¶ HELLO! APE isn‚Äôt even a company. Its sole and only purpose is for AMC to pay off debt‚Ä¶ Adam Aaron has even admitted it‚Ä¶ So why people are trading something that isn‚Äôt a company, has no sales, no earnings, no CEO, is post pandemic retail!

5 Trade ideas: I have 14 puts, I don‚Äôt want more than 15 at a time, for now, so I may open 1 or 2 more‚Ä¶ Once I started closing 3+ a day I will up it from 15.. As it stands I am closing 1-2 a day

BBBY ‚Äì I took this off ‚ÄúPlays‚Äù as it fell under 8. However after atrocious earnings I see retail trying to push this near 7‚Ä¶ Can they push this to 7.50? PLEASE!

APRN ‚Äì I have January 4.50 strikes at 1.30‚Ä¶ It is still going, I will open 1 more set of puts if they allow

WING/IRTC ‚Äì I will be up nicely at open and trade in and out when I am up 20-30%

WIX ‚Äì Some dummies decided to buy a large stake weeks ago, they must have tons of time, because short term this Web designer is a disaster. It got an upgrade today too. This crashed to 50 I didn‚Äôt like the risk/reward but now people are breathing life!

LABD ‚Äì This bear bio tech‚Ä¶ I was talking with my generals the only reason this crashed to 22 was the BIIB news.. I didn‚Äôt buy any, but may.. Let us see

# [Stock futures fall after Wednesday‚Äôs big market rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/stock-market-news-open-to-close-futures-live-updates.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures slumped Thursday, putting the major averages on track to give back some of the sharp gains seen in the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones dropped 181 points, or 0.7%, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The moves followed a broad rally for stocks a day earlier, as the Bank of England said it would purchase bonds in an effort to help steady its financial markets and the cratering British pound. Sterling has stooped to record lows against the U.S. dollar in recent days.
*****
&gt; It marked a stark shift from the aggressive tightening campaign many global central banks have undertaken to cope with surging inflation.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Wednesday gained or 1.9%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 2% after hitting a new bear market low on Tuesday. Both indexes snapped six-day losing streaks.
*****
&gt; As stocks rose and the BOE shared its bond-buying plan, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped the most since 2020 after briefly topping 4%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe are skeptical that the calmer mood in markets on Wednesday marks an end to the recent period of elevated volatility or risk-off sentiment. For a more sustained rally, investors will need to see convincing evidence that inflation is coming under control, allowing central banks to become less hawkish,‚Äù UBS‚Äô Mark Haefele wrote in a Thursday note.
*****
&gt; Wednesday‚Äôs rally put the major averages on pace to eke out small gains for the week, but they are still on track to cap off their worst month since June. The Nasdaq Composite is leading the monthly losses, down about 6.5%, while the Dow and S&amp;P are on pace to close 5.8% and 5.9% lower, respectively.
*****
&gt; On a quarterly basis, the Nasdaq is on track to break a two-quarter losing streak, while the Dow is headed for its third consecutive quarterly loss for the first time since the third quarter of 2015. The S&amp;P is on pace for its third negative quarter in a row for the first time since its six-quarter negative streak that ended the first quarter of 2009.

"Portfolio creation, stock selection and multibaggers","So about a week back, a user shared a post about a course which claims to find/teach you to find the next multi bagger stocks. Since, the user was enquiring if the course is worth it, I told him there is no secret sauce to finding multi baggers and I could guide him for free. At the outset, let me tell you I have watched the free YT videos of the person who launched the course. When I say you can learn to do this on your own, I am in no way criticizing him. I just believe anyone can DIY the stock selection process and should not require any help. Use resources like YT videos for ideas and inspiration but not as gospel.

Also, right off the bat let me tell you¬†I am slightly averse to the concept of targeting multi baggers. If not done right, I believe it amounts to speculation [which I will deal with later. So,¬†I have decided to deal with how you actually pick a stock for all practical purposes or rather make your portfolio first.I will still then deal with how I believe you can pick multi baggers. To skip to the multi baggers section, go beyond the (******) line.¬†

I have written this post in a hurry but I‚Äôve tried to cover what I believe to be the most crucial aspects in stock and multi bagger selection. In case, I‚Äôve missed any¬†points, pardon¬†me. If I can do it, I'll further break down each sub section into a seperate post and elaborate on my ideas.

Also, let me tell everyone this is just my strategy to build a portfolio and none of the principles outlined here are hard and fast rules. Before looking for multi baggers have a stable framework which gives you flexibility to search for multi baggers.This is just a framework to build a relatively low downside risk and probable over performance over the index. The flexibility you infuse over this may improve returns or be detrimental but still try your best to build on this rather than using this passively. Like everyone, I don't know anything and I may be wrong. Since it was written in a hurry over my breaks, it may be a bit haphazard/disjointed and have points repeated.

1. Building a portfolio: Only the equity portion. Please keep debt in mind, it's very important.

a. Lets deal with two concepts straight out of the bat: Alpha and Beta. While I believe alpha generated by your portfolio [which refers to risk adjusted returns, in order to outperform the index] can be assessed only after a certain duration, I do believe picking midcap and smallcap stocks can help generate this alpha if done right. For beta, I do believe historical data of stock and sector beta [a measure of volatility] is a good enough determinant of stock volatility. Each market cap should have its own flexibility of beta values set by you based on the role you have set for them. For instance, assuming the financial sector serves as an anchor in your portfolio to brace it against highs and lows, your financial stocks must have a low beta. So in my portfolio, I would rather have a HDFC Bank over a karur vysya or yes bank despite their probable prospects.

In summary, have a decent alpha with small and mid cap but don‚Äôt burn your fingers trying to generate returns. Remember alpha is RISK ADJUSTED returns and not returns. Don‚Äôt run behind returns [hence, my hatred for multi baggers since a lot are high risk businesses]. Also, have a portfolio with a realistic beta and have individual betas matching the role of the stock.

b. Time duration: Your portfolio is supposed to last you 10-15 years. Do not churn your portfolio too often, by adding or removing stocks. If you trust a stock, you‚Äôre trusting its business to last these 10-15 years. Although, I say that do learn when and why to book profits and enter/exit a particular stock. Don‚Äôt enter high and don‚Äôt exit low. However simple it may sound, the majority do end up doing this. Stock markets/ stocks don‚Äôt always go up and this is a myth.¬†Its¬†therefore crucial to enter at the right price, when the price matches your perceived value for the stock.

c. Role: Choose stocks as if you‚Äôre entering a business and create portfolios as if you‚Äôre building a nation. Every stock has its role in a portfolio. For instance, finance stands for stability, IT stands for growth, chemicals stand for rapid growth and PSUs for dividend and so on. These roles are flexible based on how you envision your portfolio. Some may assume banks to symbolise growth of the nation via credit and choose more aggressive banks. Remember, roles assigned in the portfolio are your personal opinion

d. Number of stocks in a portfolio: There never will be an ideal number. The ideal number will depend on how many you are comfortable tracking. I live a busy life and I assume many of you do. I believe 10-20 to be a good range. Any lesser may hamper diversification and any more will¬†diworsify¬†and hamper tracking. Let's take 15 to be a good number for the rest of this post. Try to choose the best 1 or 2 in each sector. Having HDFC, ICICI, Axis and Kotak serves no real purpose.

e. market cap and sectors: So let's get into some actual details. How do I divide my portfolio market cap wise? I believe a safe allocation to give returns + protect from volatility is a 4:2:1 ratio. So assuming you have 15 stocks : 2 small caps, 5 mid caps and 8 large caps [+/-1] is a good target. Any change in this ratio should be done considering your risk appetite and investment behaviour.

How do I divide my portfolio sector wise? Suppose I have 1 lakh, I‚Äôll give x percent to each sector. Here I‚Äôll name the sector and the broad role I expect it to play along with my portfolio weight.

[Sample](https://ibb.co/qWjb4bN)

In summary, decide a portfolio &gt; assign roles &gt; assign weights based on market cap and sector. Also, this is all personal. You might want a stable consumer durable and more volatile bank for eg. You might want to have more sectors taking up high growth roles and so on. This is just a template.


Selecting a stock:

1. Making sure your stock matches its assigned role.

2. Screeners: I think the most crucial thing any investor must know is to use a screener to narrow down the universe he has to navigate through. There are many online screeners available. For example, if I am studying a consumer durables company I set the screener to high industry current ratio, high free cash flow, high inventory turnover and so on. (Each industry must have its own screening parameters. For example, using debt to equity for banks makes no sense). If you select it in this way, in each market cap category you might have a maximum of 10 stocks to study. Try to reduce the number of stocks you study because studying a stock is a laborious process.

Once screened, run through the fundamentals and growth vision of the company. Only companies with strong fundamentals will survive tough times. Be rigorous with your criterias and analysis.

3. Valuation: So I divide valuation into two aspects:

a. Theoretical valuation: This is again of two types:

1. Intrinsic valuation: There are many intrinsic valuation models but I think the most widely accepted one is DCF or Discounted Cash Flow. I won‚Äôt go into its details here but will share an excel template of a DCF calculator if I find time. Intrinsic valuation is basically predicting future cash flows and assuming their present value. Remember, there are a lot of assumptions here. Valuation is a craft and there is a high chance of you being wrong. But it is currently the only tool we have and can be magical if done well. You‚Äôll get an approximate value in numbers.

A simple example is suppose you have a house you plan to buy, the person tells you it's 3 BHK worth a crore [share price]. You know 3 BHK generates 30000/month in rent [cash flow]. Now, you discount this cash flow to today's value and decide if it's actually worth a crore.

2. Relative valuation: The most famous P/E ratio is a relative valuation tool. Basically, you compare your neighbours house which was sold for a crore and say your house is also worth a crore. So you compare two stocks in the same industry to see if it's worth the price.

It's ideal to use a combination of relative + intrinsic valuation. Just average, the two values you get and buy at that value.

b. Practical valuation: Building a valuation based on your analysis of the products, sector, management etc of the company. I will elaborate more on this in the multi bagger section.

Remember, to value a stock like your mother values a vegetable in a market. You might have 100 tomatoes but the colour, size and feel of each tomato varies. Even one bad tomato can spoil a curry. So imagine what a bad stock can do to your wealth. Never buy an extremely overvalued stock just because it has done well in the past.

Be careful with valuation: Do not get stuck on numbers given by your valuation but don‚Äôt ignore it too. Learning how much importance to give valuation is as crucial as the art of valuation. Remember, high growth companies, high margin companies,, monopolies/oligopolies, sectors of the company etc. can derange your valuation and think a company is overvalued.

Margin of safety: For every valuation there is a margin of safety you assign. You must consciously avoid buying that stock if it crosses your margin of safety. This helps reduce risk drastically.

Biases on value and the value story: As I have said a stock is a business for all practical purposes. Since the most important part of valuation according to me is what I called practical valuation, your biases can easily¬†affect¬†your valuation. You might be bullish on EV stocks but¬†it's¬†not necessary that they‚Äôre the future of tomorrow. Always question the story you build for the sector you are bullish on. Building the story can make or break your valuation.

*****************************************************************************************

Multi Baggers: So finally we reach the most crucial part of that day's post, ‚ÄúHow do I pick multi baggers ?‚Äù. Remember, realistically you need 1 multi bagger with good fundamentals to last you 5 years.¬†I personally believe stocks which perform¬†in the short¬†term (&lt;1-3 years) and are bust¬†in the long¬†term are not multi baggers.


The first step is what I‚Äôve reiterated all along, identifying the business story of tomorrow. What is it that the market wants? Coming to this answer is all your hard work. When I say see the business story of tomorrow, I don‚Äôt mean only new industries like EV, green energy etc., I also mean businesses which you believe India of tomorrow wants like apparel etc.

It could be something very simple, for example you know India has less toilets so you go into a Ceramic/ sanitary ware/ PVC pipe company, since you predict there to be a market for it tomorrow. You know India loves apparel or footwear, go for a footwear/ apparel company. Titan and jewellery was probably the most predictable story. EV could be the next big thing, if not EV just batteries could be the next big thing. Look at India with a keen eye and you‚Äôll find the next multi bagger. Sometimes the simplest answer is the right one.

The easiest way thus is to keep your eyes and ears open to how the world is evolving and to identify what‚Äôs in demand in your country. Read the news, listen to people, find the wants and you‚Äôll see their needs. Find the problems and companies which answer them. See what the government is aiming for. The day I wrote this, few apolitical topics discussed were Indian defence, Green Power, Sugar, Ethanol in the first page and the ads were about the Big Billion Days sale. These are not recommendations but you should know what you and your countrymen consume. Understanding the industry/product is the first step to finding multi baggers. The company must either do something unique or do something better/ cheaper/ more efficiently/ faster than its predecessors. They must be disruptors but with simple philosophies and strategies.

You heard about Vedanta and the semiconductor plant news [turned out to be false], Vedanta might not be the best stock but do you know what are the other steps in silicon wafer synthesis? Maybe you could read up on how chips are made and who supplies the components required to make chips. For any product, you have multi baggers at three steps: Pre- production [who sources/supplies the components to make the product?], Production [who is producing the products? Who produces the equipment involved in making the product?], Post Production [Who distributes the product?], Consumer end [Who uses the product and sells the finished goods using the product?]. So if we take silicon chips for example: Players in the quartz/quartzite industry, Players in the silicon chip industry, players in the chip distribution [here its foxconn I assume], Washing machine/ refrigerator companies which use it and so on.

The three sectors I currently search for potential multi baggers are: consumer services, consumer durables/discretionary//auto and chemicals. Possible other sectors are: IT, FMCG and Capital Goods. I am sure you see a pattern: Consumer services, consumer durables and FMCG are obvious multi bagger stories because the business grows on the back of a product category and India is a heavy consumer economy. You give a poor man 2000, he‚Äôll go buy food. Give a man 20000 he‚Äôll buy electronics, apparel etc. The remaining i.e. chemicals, IT and Capital goods are the main industries required for India to grow tomorrow. It's easier to find multi bagger stories for these sectors.

Now, go to any youtube channel claiming potential multibaggers and see what is the first aspect they stress on. It will be the industry.

Here are some other strategies you can add to your checklist:

1. Market leader in the segment/ Competitor to the market leader¬† eg. Bata vs Metro brands

2. Margin Kings: These have products with High profit and net income margins. This money can be reinvested in the business and see a boom or be given as dividends.

3. High capex companies

4. Twin engine companies: correlating eps and PE ratios

5. Moat heavy companies

6. Miscellaneous: Low debt/ high free cash flow/ high¬†reinvestment rate/ high asset turnover/high inventory turnover

Now three main issues and why I am not a fan of multi baggers for regular investors:


1. The Industry first approach: One of the most popular strategies in stock selection, especially of potential market out performers, has been selecting an industry you see being the next big thing of tomorrow and selecting the sector leaders among all the players. The IT and Internet stocks are probably the most famous example of this approach. But, this approach similarly has its own drawbacks. Industry and revenue growth does not always translate directly to profit growth for the company or investors. A number of factors such as macroeconomic and interdependence between sectors can hamper the sector's growth. For example, Airline companies were considered the next big thing at one point with increasing traffic and trade every year but despite this due to capacity and fuel issues, the profits were never as good. So detailed analysis of the next big sector is required before betting on it.

Another issue is selecting the potential market leader in a field like IT/ Internet is difficult. So your chances of picking the companies with promise might not always be dependable.

Also, by the time you come to the conclusion that so-and-so is the next big sector, it's very likely that the majority of investors have thought of that too. Like in the case of EV, the stock prices would have run up and are now above intrinsic value. Buying them above this value is fraught with dangers, however exciting the industry as you expose yourself to potential losses.

People may end up compromising on fundamentals of the business and valuation of the stock, predicting fantastic growth numbers due to their bias that this is the next big industry. You might end up paying a premium for an industry which may never hit off/ may never see profitability/ may never scale as a nationwide business.

2. The Speculation: As is evident from my explanation, I am sure you realise the amount of speculation going into your multi bagger selection. Even your valuation of the industry can be way off target. A cloud of bias might be shrouding your analysis despite it being obvious to many others. So my suggestion, if you are investing in multi baggers, treat it as speculation for all practical purposes. Keep ~5-10% of your monthly investments as a speculative fund and never consider it under your broad investment fund. If it earns profits, withdraw the profits. Never ever mix your speculative and investing accounts. Buying stocks on suggestions from others without doing your own work amounts to speculation. These are always gambles and can go very wrong. So be prepared to lose capital

3.¬†Making the wrong choice. You need to have excellent analytical skills to beat the professionals.The stock may have already run up on the basis of the news as all investors are predicting based on similar information. If your analysis and that of the professionals do match,¬†it's¬†likely the stock may have run up its course. Were you the only one betting on EV?

Remember, multi bagger doesn't have a consistent definition and for all practical purposes¬†the sensex index has been a multi bagger itself. You don't need one whatever others tell you. It takes years, often &gt;10 years to become a true multi bagger. Have courage, patience and conviction if you enter this territory.

So, the basic outline to find your multi bagger:

1. Find the company/ product with the story. Ask the right questions, be observant and understand businesses. Generally, look in the small cap segment.

2. See if the company is undervalued. Try to buy at atleast fair value. [Avoid IPOs for this reason]

3. Ensure there are strong fundamentals, in terms of revenue, leverage, cash flow and a very strong management.

4. Track vigorously. Multi Baggers tend to go off rails very quickly with their¬† fundamentals and valuations.

The next time someone tells you so-n-so is the next multi bagger, run it through these and decide for yourself if it's a multi bagger. As a practice test for the next IPO listing, try to see if the company's product impresses you. Read their reports and value them yourself.


To end it off, here are some basics in managing behaviour:

1. The past serves as a great source of information about how the markets reacted to various situations. Lack of such knowledge could make one likely to repeat similar mistakes.

2. Periodic investment of a fixed amount of money known as Dollar-Cost Averaging or Systematic Investment Planning, might be a feasible strategy to avoid catching highs while also enforcing a behavioural discipline in investors.

3. The core principles, framework and behaviour of Investing do not change but they must be adapted and applied to changing macroeconomic and industry situations.

4. A stock, however attractive and well established cannot be bought at any price expecting it to eventually go higher over the long term.

5. Your biggest enemy is yourself, so your first goal must be to avoid errors.

6. Emotional intelligence trumps investment intelligence in the markets. Knowledge in finance, accounting and industry is worth nothing if you don‚Äôt have the behavioural discipline to invest. Cultivate that before you learn analysing businesses.

7. Wisdom in the market may not always translate to better results. Keep it simple. It is difficult to ‚Äúbeat the average‚Äù. Simple good stock portfolio and debt component will give very good results. If you want to venture out of this territory be sure of yourself and make sure you are not speculating.

8. Losses can be more damaging than you expect. Value investing and margin of safety are the two ways you can protect yourself from error and losses.

9. The market is like a pendulum, you have periods of exhilaration where the majority of the stocks are above value and a period of depression following this when the overall outlook is grim. If one follows the principles of valuing stocks, you‚Äôll buy from the pessimists in the depression and sell to the optimists in exhilaration. Stocks are more risky at high prices. Bear markets are your friend.

10. Stock market is not predictable. Make your behaviour predictable.

11. If anyone tells you the stock market is/is not gambling, remember its investing that is not gambling. Speculation is still a form of gambling and must be controlled.

12. Only speculators look at stock price. Investors look at value.

13. Formula and Smart strategy based investing does not always work. Most data for these strategies are back tested and look great in hindsight. They may not and generally don‚Äôt always work in the future. These formulas are either correlational flukes or those which worked in the past or those which extracted the commonality of stocks which did well in the past.",IndianStreetBets,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/xr42oq/portfolio_creation_stock_selection_and/,Shitpost,newboiya,xr42oq,/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/xr42oq/portfolio_creation_stock_selection_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStreetBets/comments/xr42oq/portfolio_creation_stock_selection_and/,1,2022-09-29
Trying to decide on a 75% with knob.,"I'm in the market for a new keyboard, coming from a cheap full size mechanical (Element Gaming Beryllium w Kailh Reds), i want something smaller that will take less of my mouse swiping space for gaming. I started with the akko 3068b, but i want to return it as i miss the F row too much (I have audio hotkeys on them). I've decided that the 75% layout is probably what i need, and really like the knobs that some of them have.

So far I found these:

* Akko 5075b Plus (¬£120 fully built)
* Epomaker TH80 (¬£85 fully built)
* Glorious GMMK Pro (¬£150 for barebones)
* Next Time 75 Aluminium (¬£144 for barebones)
* Akko PC75b (out of stock?)  
* Akko Mod007 (and mod007v2) (out of stock)

I'm trying to decide if its worth it to go with the more expensive aluminum case options (gmmk pro, nexttime), or if i should just get the plastic ones for cheaper.

Also struggling to decide between the 5075b plus and the th80. the pc75b looks good too, but i cant find it in stock.

One thing about the akko, i do like the keycaps, so that reduces the total price if i get the 5075 over a barebones kit.

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Bitcoin Price Climbs Upward With Trading Volume At A 3-Month High,"https://ifttt.com/images/no\_image\_card.png

Just in the past 24 hours, the crypto market was practically in green, with several assets reclaiming some values, including Bitcoin. But the trend has suddenly reversed to a negative direction. As a result, the majority of the crypto assets in the market have declined drastically.

Bitcoin has crashed from its height of over $20,000 in today‚Äôs trading hours. The token lacked the necessary support to remain at its higher level. After crossing the $20K boundary, BTC later fell to around $18,770 in the early trading hours of today. This was through a decline of over 6% in its value.

Recall that Bitcoin [recorded](https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1574980660153839616) a massive growth of more than 5% yesterday. This drove its market cap to sit above $386 billion. Also, its dominance over the altcoin almost hit 40%.

Other crypto assets were not left out during the bullish trend of last Tuesday. Most of the tokens swell bigger in the green. This growth spiked the overall market cap to almost $1 trillion through a massive gain of over 40 billion in one day.

 Price Decline For Bitcoin And Broader Crypto Market In the early hours of trading today, Ethereum went below the $1,300 level after losing about 7%. Other significant altcoins also dipped in their values but are now trending upwards.

At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $19,362, indicating a minor over the past 24 hours. Subsequently, its market cap dropped to $365.8 billion. As a result, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance over the altcoins decreased by 0.38% in the past 24 hours to 39.46%.

 Bitcoin recovers above $19,300 l [BTCUSDT on Tradingview.com](http://Tradingview.com)But despite its price fall, BTC trading volume has surged. Currently, its 24-hour trading volume sits at over $57.8 billion. This marked a 3-month high for the primary crypto asset.

An on-chain data firm, Santiment, explained the pump and dump situation. It stated that the market is experiencing an increase in trading volumes, especially Bitcoin, amid price decline. The spike in trading volume has been gradual within the year following its lowest in late January. Also, it cited that the BTC price peaked on Tuesday, which came since June 14.

 Impact Of Macro Factors On Crypto Assets With the rising inflation rate, macro factors have been pulling the crypto assets down. This situation [turned](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/bitcoin-turns-lower-as-us-stock-selloff-extends-into-sixth-day-1.1824573) negative for the US equities, with bonds, stocks, and commodities battling volatility.

For some period, Bitcoin and the entire crypto wade off the pressure from their correlation with the US equities. But they couldn‚Äôt sustain it. Hence, the global macro factors, through high-interest rates and other influences, are currently affecting Bitcoin and other crypto assets.

Developer: my gem are stucked in market.,"Nobody is buying my 64k 3/5 Howler despite I've set -50% which is the minimum price I'm allowed to sell, I have no idea why the market price for 3/5 Howler is 128k. 2/5 Howler selling 30-40k, 4/5 Howler selling 70-80k in my server. There are more than 10 3/5 Howler stucked at 64k in market now and I'm reluctant to use it as gem power since it should worth at least 40-50k.

Since game player base is a bit mature now, nobody need 3/5 anymore, people are treating 3/5 as duplicate. Thus normally 3/5 price is very near to 2/5.

Suggestion
1)Allow us to sell lower than 50% if there is no buyer every 2 days
OR
2)Market price automatic reduce by 5% everyday if there is no buyer and there is stock in the market
 
AND

3)Give more platinum per day in dailies since game can buy additional one leg crest for 1600 plat, we won't have enough plat to buy. You are giving us the option to buy leg crest one per week but you don't give us the money to buy it.

There are many places are reducing players plat 
1)Warband voucher 1600/week
2)leg crest 1600/week
3)Echo crystal 
4)Skill stone 500/stone
6)15% auction house market fee 

And we only get 300 x 7 = 2100 plat, I'm suggesting increase 300 to 500-600 plat per day.

I already see a deflation in my server, every gem are so cheap, one gem power in my server is roughly 800 plat, which were 1200/GP when there were fake whale, then 1000/GP before patch, after patch is 800/plat. Tourmaline is 200 plat, all other gem including sapphire is 100/plat, skill stone average 1000/plat.",DiabloImmortal,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiabloImmortal/comments/xqx11x/developer_my_gem_are_stucked_in_market/,Feedback,Expzero1,xqx11x,/r/DiabloImmortal/comments/xqx11x/developer_my_gem_are_stucked_in_market/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiabloImmortal/comments/xqx11x/developer_my_gem_are_stucked_in_market/,0,2022-09-29

The demand for meaty flavor has become pronounced globally with ‚Äúumami‚Äù setting the trend among the end-users. Amidst the sedentary and hectic lifestyle, the market presence of ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook meals has provided an impetus to the industry growth. Moreover, the growth of the middle-class population across emerging economies has encouraged meat extract manufacturing companies to augment their production. According to the 2018 Global Economic Development Report at Brookings, the global middle-class in 2030 could have 5.41 billion people. Additionally, consumers have exhibited an inclination for animal meat products as a potential source of protein. Food Innovation Australia Ltd. (FIAL) claims India and China will contribute a 47% surge in global protein consumption by 2025.

The trend for plant-based substitutes, along with the high vegan population, could impede the market growth of meat extract.

**Regional Insights**

**North America to Remain at the Helm with the Demand for Processed Foods**

End-users in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico are likely to seek meat extract products on the heels of the trend for meaty flavors. The food &amp; beverage companies have upped investments in meat stock to help boost the flavor in cooking. Prominently, meat consumption is poised to surge following the demand for red meat products. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the total amount of meat consumed in the U.S. could touch 219 pounds per person by 2025.

The Asia Pacific meat extract market share will witness a commendable gain due to the presence of major food companies. Commercial food outlets have expanded their footfall across the emerging economies. Notable demand for ready-to-eat food will be pronounced across the region, thereby encouraging leading companies to augment their investments.

Looking to upgrade my Hot end but the market is vast and i don't know where to start!,"Hi there! So i have an ender 3 pro and have been in love with it for a long time but i felt it was time to dig deeper into the world of filaments and so I have decided to look into getting a new hotend/direct drive extruder combo. I was wondering if anybody had some recomendations or possibly a video on youtube comparing several options? i don't really know what to look for in a hot end or an extruder upgrade. I have a very well tuned printer so i can absolutely print parts if needed but i'd prefer something that works well out of the box and can be installed on an otherwise stock ender 3 pro running a stock 4.2.2 board.

also any tips for things i should be aware of when changing the hot end (like setting changes and calibrations that need doing) i'd love to hear about as well. Thank you!",ender3,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/xqv4tc/looking_to_upgrade_my_hot_end_but_the_market_is/,,ackley14,xqv4tc,/r/ender3/comments/xqv4tc/looking_to_upgrade_my_hot_end_but_the_market_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ender3/comments/xqv4tc/looking_to_upgrade_my_hot_end_but_the_market_is/,0,2022-09-29

European Apes wake up all the sheeple you can.,"Wake up all the european sheeple you can. Get your money out of the banks ASAP you dont have much time left. Banking crisis to unfold. Pension funds are basically insolvent. Good luck to all.

Armstrong

Europe is in big financial trouble with Russian natural gas turned off as a retaliation from the sanctions. Armstrong explains, ‚ÄúIn Europe, I believe they are actually deliberately doing this, and this is Klaus Schwab‚Äôs ‚ÄòGreat Reset.‚Äô They know they have a serious problem. They lowered rates to below 0% in 2014. They just started raising interest rates. Meanwhile, you ordered all the pension funds throughout Europe to have more than 70% in government bonds. Then they took it negative. All the pension funds are insolvent. Europe is fiscal mismanagement on a grand scale. There is no way it can sustain itself, and we are looking at Europe breaking apart.‚Äù So, could Europe suck the rest of the world down the tubes? Armstrong says, ‚ÄúOh, absolutely. Europe is the problem. . . . The crisis in banking will start in Europe. . . . The debt is collapsing. They have no way to sustain themselves. The debt market over there is undermining the stability of all the banks. You have to understand that reserves are tied to government debt, and this is the perfect storm. Yes, the (U.S.) stock market will go down short term. We are not facing a 1929 event or a 90% fall here. . . . Europeans, probably by January of 2023, as this crisis in Ukraine escalates, anybody with half a brain is going to take whatever money they have and get it over here.‚Äù So, where is smart money going to go? Armstrong says, ‚ÄúStocks are like gold, it is on the same side of the table and is opposite government debt. People are not going to be buying government debt. They are going to be looking at anything in the private sector. . . . People are buying whatever they can to get off the grid.‚Äù

Armstrong has never been more positive on buying gold. Why? Armstrong explains, ‚ÄúWe are looking at a sovereign debt default. This is what‚Äôs going on. This is why Biden will spend whatever he wants because he knows he doesn‚Äôt have to pay it back. Eventually, this is what‚Äôs going to happen. This is Schwab‚Äôs agenda.‚Äù Armstrong has predicted ‚Äú2023 will be the year from Hell.‚Äù Armstrong says, ‚ÄúCivil unrest will only get worse‚Äù this year, and he is predicting we will have full blown war next year. Armstrong contends Democrats are desperate and will do things like granting illegal aliens citizenship so they can vote in the mid-term elections. In closing, Armstrong says, ‚ÄúSomething is going to spark a collapse in government again. It‚Äôs going to be something, I think, in Europe where they do something drastic because they have no other choice. . . . They need war as the excuse for the defaults of all the government debt.‚Äù

With the NASDAQ putting a halt on low float, Chinese IPO's for the moment, this is the closest we will get.  We also have reports that China State Banks ordered to buy stocks.  Not to mention, this is the last low float deSPAC play with options we will likely see for a while.

Expect next short interest numbers to be drastically increased based on activity we've seen over the last few days.  Next settlement date is tomorrow.  Won't see those numbers until October but we can still squeeze them in the meantime.

There is also the fact that the Sponsor will forfeit 1.4m shares if the stock doesn't trade over certain thresholds ($12.50 and $15) for 20 trading days within a 30 day trading period.  So, obviously massive incentive for them to push this up over $15.

We've already seen cost to borrow get as high as 265%.  Currently sits at 111%.  Will likely see this get to 1000% like other similar plays.  1.38m float is also almost identical to the $FAZE float and $FAZE made it to $25.  We have time here as only the Sponsor and THIL shares are registered and those are locked-up for months.  

Good luck to all.  Let's get it!

Wealth Formula Episode 335: How to Buy Expensive Toys and Profit!," 

*Catch the full episode: https://www.wealthformula.com/podcast/335-how-to-buy-expensive-toys-and-profit/*

**Buck:** Welcome back to the show, everyone. Today, my guest on Wealth Formula podcast is PJ Ghadimi. He is a self-made entrepreneur, philosopher, author and creator of the Wealth Transfer Methodology. I was particularly taken by PJ's businesses that he's created around essentially enjoying your life now, being able to buy things you want and essentially either make money or not lose money, which is, I think, a really, really fascinating concept and one that people should really consider. Specifically, he has a few different platforms called Secret Entourage, Exotic Car Hacks and Watch Trading Academy. P.J., Welcome Wealth from your podcast.

**PJ:** And I appreciate you having me on.

**Buck:** Yeah man. So give us a little bit of background because, you know, I think this is this is something that actually that I've only recently, you know, this concept of sort of living and enjoying the things that you want and feeling like, okay, you can do this by not it not just being an expense on your balance sheet that it can actually be an asset. Where did you get this from? I mean, is this always something you the way you've always thought or what?

**PJ:** No. I mean, think about it. Like I mean, isn't that the whole purpose of buying a home? Right. We get to enjoy our home. We live in it. And then when we go to sell it and we want to upgrade to something, there's some result out of that ownership. Even though it wasn't intended, it was like, Hey, I just bought a house because I really like that. And why went up like $1,000,000 if I'm considering it where you live, right? So you're able to basically increase not only your net worth, but also just do what you're going to do anyways. So I share a huge background in finance where I grew up most of my younger years were spent as a VP for a bank, and then when I got fired from that job, I had a passion for cars, watches, art and the finer things in life. And I grew up really poor. So those things were not in the books for me very early on with my life, but I had to save up a lot of money to buy cars, you know, like everybody else. And as I started losing money time and time again on cars, I got tired of it. And so when I got fired from banking and decided, I said, You know what? There's three key things that I learned in making that were really big. And it's that banks are ahead of the game. They basically look at trends, they look at human behavior, they look at leverage, and then they kind of look at like values of things because they do a lot of lending. So I started looking at these, you know, algorithms and ways that banks thought, and I said, Well, why couldn't a person kind of duplicate this in their own life, kind of predicting people's behaviors, algorithms and things like that? And then as a result of that, create a model, you know, for their own life. And I thought maybe obviously is going to be on a much smaller scale than a bank which does in on billions of dollars daily. But I said it's got to be possible. And then I said, Well, we're already doing this with our homes. 

We just don't realize it. Like, so there's got to be like, is there a reason why we couldn't do this with cars, watches or art? And I started to realize there was one key correlation between all of these assets, like cars, watches, art and homes. And is that no matter if you look at it on a short term basis, there's always this valuation difference of supply and demand. So supply and demand is constantly changing the game. But if you look at it on a long term basis, like ten, 20 years, then historically real estate has always been on the up. So like you look at a short term, you go, Oh, we're looking at 25 to 28 where you had a peak, you're a lawyer, whatever. But if you look at it over 20 years, you're like, Well, real estate is a sure bet.

No matter what you buy, buy an apartment, buy a house, doesn't matter. And it always comes down to the idea that population will always increase above the supply of goods. Right. Like it just makes sense. Yeah. So I decided to look at that in the same sphere, to looked at cars and watches. I said, well, these companies do a really good job at keeping their supply limited. Like Lamborghini doesn't want tens of thousands of cars out. That's why for a long duration time, they used to only make 2000 cars. So they were like and I started thinking twice, I would say, on people going to get wealthier Isn't that a byproduct of generally speaking, like each and every industry continuously increases it like its output? So people there's more millionaires today than there were a thousand years ago and so on and so forth.

And so I started kind of putting this this framework together, and I started realizing that as long as these exclusive places create scarce levels of supply, then demand will because population will increase, demand will naturally go up. There will be more demand for higher end homes that are like nicer rather than apartment buildings, because those will be more rentals in the future because people will be poorer.

So I just started thinking about that and I started putting an algorithm together that built my next business in 2005, which was at the time called VIP motoring. Today, that business evolved into one of investments which was investing in exotic cars, watches and arts and doing it with people. And so I created that business. And from 2005 to 2010, I kind of that's what, you know, my my biggest business was it was a huge investment for an A basically cater to bringing in investments, not for banking like back in the day, but rather this time for cars, watches and art. And in 2008, I kind of looked at the future because there was a downturn and everything was going to and I kind of said, well, you know what? This is a cool business and we're going to keep doing it. It's going to make a lot of money. But what would be even cooler would be give people the opportunity to do this at home themselves.

**Buck:** Yeah. So just to be clear, your first business was essentially, you know, a syndication business where you're collecting fine art or cars, things that are going to appreciate your store. But no one really gets an opportunity to, you know, enjoy them per se. They're it's like anything else. Okay. Yeah, it sounds good.

**PJ:** And you see what was happening, like what gave me an indicator that people wanted to enjoy these things, not just buy them and make money with them, was that I had the same clients come to me and go, Hey, I know we're putting our money together and we're buying this $2 million car and hopefully it's going to go up, right.

But a lot of times they were also saying, well, what if I want a personal Ferrari? Like, can I just can you help me buy one? Like, how do I know I'm buying it at the right dollar? Yeah. Am I going to lose money? What it what's going to happen? So I started getting more and more of these requests. 

So our entire company also had a division which was brokering and helping people basically acquire these assets to use, which at that point was no longer an investment. But it was, hey, you're lose less money because we're doing it the right way and you'll be better off. And so I realized that there's such demand for this that I was like starting to teach online at the time.

In 2008, I started Second Class, which is an online platform around business. And then I said, You know what? Since I learned now how to basically sell information online, I'm going to start teaching people how to do this car stuff and watch stuff independently of each other. And just if they want to learn about watches, they'll take one. If they want to learn about cars, they'll do the other. But anyone can basically play this game. It doesn't really matter as long as they understand that you need some level of credit or cash and that you understand that you want an exotic car, you're not forced to buy one. So it's not really looked at, is an investment, is looking at it as an opportunity to basically enjoy the things you want in life without losing money, which was essentially what I had been doing personally since I was like 19 years old.

**Buck:** Yeah. You know, it's interesting because one of the the one of my friends locally here in Montecito kind of introduced me to this concept broadly. He, he was a guy who, like, bought he just kept buying like the the, you know, the cool cars that he wanted. They happened to be, you know, he had like a he had a couple of gold wings yet a dino and all that. And he drove them. He had a great time and then he sold them for massive profit. And I was like, That's a great idea. But then I sort of dug down to like other parts of his life and like literally the furniture in his house, right? The furniture is all like vintage stuff. It's not, you know, like he's paying more for it now with the idea that he's not going to lose money on this, he might even make money on this. And it's it's just it's a concept that actually, when people hear about it, they're like, wow, that's just, you know, that sounds like something if, you know, you got to be pretty rich for it. So why don't you address that? Can somebody who makes two, $300,000 a year do this kind of thing? And and is it is that difficult?

**PJ:** So what you just said right there is is a very real thing, which is it's called basically the storage of wealth. It's consumerism is starting to lose its glamor for people. People are like, I don't want to be a consumer of the product anymore. I tired of buying a Ferrari, losing 50k a year driving it. They're tired of buying shit that's basically worth nothing after six months and they starting to realize that the more you tap into consumerism, the more money you have to make to basically piss it away. So they're starting to look at everything from a layer of investment, but even becoming an investor, a lot of times young kids want to become investors when they have no money. You can't be an investor if you have no money to invest. So basically, either you have to create the bank leverage to take that money, or you're basically making enough money to have excess money to invest in order to make more money.

Now, can someone with two 300k year or a physician or something play right like a normal person that doesn't have like millions of dollars saved up and so on and so forth? Sure. Absolutely. But you can play at a much smaller scale, which means that you can't go buy $2 million car and be like, oh, I'm just going to start here because I just have to understand. That's what I can buy, things I can't afford one.

**Buck:** And that's interesting because the platform is called exotic car hacks. But in reality, it's about not just, you know, Lamborghinis and things, but it's really about cars that are just desirable cars. So they can be at multiple different levels. 

**PJ:** 100%. We have luxury car hacks that focuses on BMW use and Mercedes cars and Cadillacs that are your day to day drivers. You're going to put in a lot of miles. Then we have exotic car hacks that focuses heavily on exotic badges like Maserati, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin. And most people think those cars, they go, That's 200 grand. It's 300 grand for a car. That's crazy. I mean, these cars can be bought as cheap as 30 grand. You know, there's some Aston Martin them for $45,000, I would argue. It's actually really funny. Sometimes you'll see in the street, people praise the guy for driving a Lamborghini. It's like 12 years old. And that car is like $80,000.

But they don't praise the other guy that's driving the 250,000 Range Rover because they don't know what the British are. And so they they don't have that perspective because they don't know cars enough and they go, well, Lamborghini is automatically more expensive. Range Rover. This lack of knowledge about the depreciation cycles of things means that they look at everything from its face, value in their mind.

Lamborghini is what they saw the dealership yesterday and that car was 380,000. And that's very expensive for a person. And and they think in their conventional mindset and go, well, if I put that in the loan calculator, that means I'd have to pay $6,000 a month. Well, that's crazy for a car, but my argument would be this what if I told you you could buy, let's say, a very spare Ferrari four, five, eight, something that a lot of people would love to have. You could buy that car for 200 grand, drive it for two years and sell it for 210 grand. Now, with inflation, that's basically saying you either broke even or lost someone or whatever. But what it really means is that you were able to drive this car for two years and enjoy it without really having a cost, a heavy cost, a burden of loss by having it.

Now, what if I told you that to insure that car is probably less than $600 every six months, which is insanely cheap and not what people expect. People think Ferrari very expensive insurance. And what if I also told you that is very unlikely that it will ever break down if you follow the specific step by step guide I have on how to do that now, the three things that scare people depreciation, high cost of insurance, high cost repairs.

Now, here comes the next argument. Well, I still have to pay 3000 a month for the car. Well, if you get a loan and you can't afford to pay cash. Sure, but what if I told you out of that $3,000, 20 $600 of that money was basically being parked in the car? No different than a savings account. And the extra 400 was the interest, which was your cost of not being able to pay for cash or choosing to use the money elsewhere? If there was more value in using the 200 elsewhere. So if you look at it that way, then your real cost of ownership would be that $400 across the two years you carried the interest on that. And even your insurance would actually be null because you would pay insurance on a car anyways. I would argue sure you would have a car. You have to pay insurance. There's no way to get around that. Even if you pay lower insurance. But the point is that Ferrari or Lamborghini insurance is not necessarily more expensive than normal car insurance. It's just that people don't know how to behave. So they go to Geico and they go, I bought a Lamborghini, can I add it to my insurance?

And it's like, Well, sure, it's $5,000 a year. Like, Oh my God, it was a thousand before so conventional thinking is what is basically polluting people's minds that these things are unattainable. But today, in today's industry, in today's world, there is more exotic cars on the road than ever before. And today's Lamborghini like base Lamborghini is yesterday's luxurious BMW because money has risen and meaning like what it costs to own things has risen. Like, imagine if you were a millionaire 20 years ago. You were rich. If you're a millionaire today, you're not that rich. Like, that's not a lot of buying power. You know, you can't say I have $1,000,000. And I'm like, Wow, did you know we should all praise you what you do for your living, you know, like it don't really matter anymore. But in the old days it did. And so what I'm arguing is that today's 300 year car is no different than yesterday's. 20 years ago was like 58 car. It was a luxury then that was unattainable for most. And now it's a luxury that seems unattainable from us. But if you learn how to bridge that gap, you realize that it doesn't have to cost more than your regular $50,000 of your car to have something that you've always wanted that you thought you'd have to work ten years.

**Buck:** So what kinds of things do you teach within, you know, the say let's just take the exotic car tax form. I mean, are there there are proprietary ideas in terms of, you know, how to predict, you know, the the car's value over time and, you know when to buy that kind of thing. Of course. And how do you how do you get that stuff? I mean, is it just are you modeling it out somehow? 

**PJ:** I've been doing it for such a long time. That I like. So here's the difference between where my data comes from and when a normal person's data comes from. You see, a normal person may enter this game and say, Hey, I kind of get what he's doing. I'm going to figure it out on my right. Yeah. And they basically look at today's exotic cars and they would have to look at the next ten years of exotic cars to mimic my data, to basically be like, what is the baseline today and where we going?

I'm lucky enough that when I started doing this back in the early 2000s, we didn't have that many exotic cars. So the models didn't involve hundreds of cars, 50 different variation of every car, 12 different models here. And that in all the year generations in between. So I grew up modeling this with a limited number of cars that was very easy to model and then expanded as new models came on the market.

A lot of people wouldn't be able to model that today because they would have to deal with so many models and variations over so long to get a grasp on. Like, is this model trending up? Is this model going down? Is this likely? What options are desirable? Which options are historic for the last ten years? Which ones are not?

But all of that knowledge is basically what have documented since the early 2000, because I used to do this for like investors and then I did it for myself as I got richer to my own car collection today. But the main thing that I try to share with people is that all this knowledge and has an actual pattern to it, and these two patterns are called my wealth transfer methodology as well as my bottom cash value methodology to know what the bottom dollar is that something is worth based on what it is. It's year mileage, etc. and being able to understand that anything above that purchase price is your risk exposure. Anything below that is literally guaranteed cash. So it's almost like saying if you looked at the wholesale value of the home and you said, if I was going to go to one of these trashy places, it says, We buy your home for any dollar, which would be a low bottom and low lowball number that you would get.

What would that number be? What if you could predict that number for every car in the market? And if you have an algorithm, you can do that. So then it helps you then make a decision on instead of saying, Can I afford a 200k car? You ask yourself, Can I afford a 200k car? But really, can I afford to lose $7,000 this year? And if the answer is yes, then you might say, Well, 7k is not that scary. 200k might be a scary loss, but 7k doesn't get it right.

**Buck:** Exactly. The cost of, you know, having some fun to exactly, you know, tell me, I'm curious because you also deal with watches. And I recently started buying some some watches myself. And I again, it's the same type of thing, right? Like I'm buying some Rolexes that I know are not going to go down in value and that kind of thing. But you have a platform where, again, how similar or different is that conceptually from what you're doing with cars?

**PJ:** So the way I look at cars as an asset class is a world preservation asset class, like where basically you're buying the right cars at first because you're going to buy them anyways and you lose your ass instead you're doing it the right way. You're not losing. Then you get more money and you're going to. I'm buying cars for collection purposes that are going to increase in value and this is going to create some kind of income in the long term. But this is not a year in, year out flip flipping. We're not flipping cars, we're just investing in cars, holding cars and enjoying it while making money. I call it a wealth preservation strategy, not a creation strategy. On the watch side, the volume, the liquidity, the mobility of money in the watch game is significantly more than cars. It has no paperwork trail.

You don't have titles. You don't have to change membership names or anything on the on the paperwork as you exchange hands, etc.. So you basically are buying a watch and this watch trades hands over time. It's secondary value based on the scarcity of supply is significantly more depending on the right watch the wrong watch, significantly more than what it would be brand new.

There's two ways to play the watch game. Either you play it as an investor, you buy yourself, let's say $1,000,000 worth of watches or 500 grand or 100 grand or ten grand, whatever you want. And little by little, you build a collection that retains its value. And over time, some of these watches increase in value depending on which ones they aren't. The increase more or less. But in other cases, if you want to create wealth through watches, there's also an incredible opportunity to actually buy watches and resell them on the secondary markets in many cases for 2 to 300% of their value within moments after buying them. And it comes down to a carefully curated strategy that I share my academy on not only how to attain these watches without being a professional buyer or spending millions dollars, but also how to select which watches you want to attain so that over time, as you buy them and try to sell them, you're doing a better job of selecting the right models that are going to bring the right premium. You know, we know that these watches were like 38 grand when they came out. The John Mayer. They told us, yeah, they're currently trading wholesale for 70 and on retail sites for like 100 to 120. And if you use that example alone, you can either be the guy that buys it at 38 grand, it sells it for 70 grand quick to a wholesaler, make your money like that. And you're like, I doubled my money in one day. Great. Or B, you can be the guy to say, Hey, retail is like over 100. K I'm just going to hold this watch for a little bit. I'm going to wear it a couple of times, but I'm going to hold it for two or three years and then the market will catch up with the retail and I'll eventually sell for 100 grand, but I want to collect it.

So now you tripled your money, right? So you know, there's an opportunity to make quick money. There's also an opportunity to hold and make long term money, all of which are just a choice of how you spend your money.

**Buck:** Yeah, it's absolutely fascinating stuff. Is there is there other things besides cars and watches that you've you've you've used the same kind of methodology on?

**PJ:** Yeah. So I'm also a financier in art. This is the other part that I found to be very valuable. Now for art it's very different. I don't buy art for my house like I buy art for my house. I'll increase in value, but I'm also not buying art in the pretext of like flipping it or moving it. It's more of a storage of wealth, just like your buddy was saying about his vintage couch, you know, like something unique that was different that will always have value.

I look at it that way for my home, but on the other side, there's also a huge opportunities to basically finance artists as they bring collections forward to art galleries and art galleries. One carry the paper basically, and there's ways to basically get involved in the art space and make anywhere from 10 to 20% every six months. And your money, just by floating these galleries for the dollar investment, they need to basically make purchases of art. I would say that in the space of art, I look at it in the what I call the third axis, which first I look at cars because you're going to own a car anyways. Secondly, a leisure is watches because it's an income creator and also dispose your extra income that you're not going to like in case of a total failure of a financial crisis. Your watch is going to go first, your car next to your house last. But like that's just there. Like you're not going to dump your house first, live in your car and like be like I'm I'm attached as watch forever. Like, fuck the watch. You know, the car comes later and then eventually you're like, okay, the house has to go if it has to go, but otherwise we're going to save that. And historically, that's because of how you believe that, you know, each asset is going to hold stronger. If you're going to hold your better basket and say, hey, this basket can collapse, but also because you need a place to live, right? And that no matter what, you need a place to stay and you don't have to drive far.

You want to drive free. You don't has to wear Rolex. You want a Rolex, so you want to go before your needs. But the way I look at art is it would be the first thing to go. So the way I look at those type of things is these ultra luxuries I wouldn't recommend getting into until you have a substantial amount of disposable cash and have already made your investments, your alternative asset investments, you already have your cash flow in checks and then go, Hey, you know what, I'm going to buy art for my house anyway.

So instead of buying trash from the local gallery that has stuff that's overpriced, like 80%, I'm just going to go and find artists that perhaps are going to bring a higher premium. And I'm going to work with real art dealers, then sell art that has a real long term value. Not just it's cool. It looks nice on my wall.

**Buck:** Are there any you know, we when this show we talk particularly because we're in real estate about tax implications. Can you talk a little bit about that when it comes to capital gains on, you know, watches art? I mean, a collectibles are the the are profits are taxed at a pretty high rate, aren't they? 

**PJ:** Of course, I mean, in a in a typical way, if you're a normal person, that just is going to collect things. Yes. But I always encourage and break down for people in my courses, specifically how to set up an LLC or a corporation so that you're in that business. So it's taxed as business income rather than collectible income.

Now I will also state that I think one good thing to understand is that there are tax advantages, even in the car side, for example, that people aren't aware of. As an example, we all know that section 179 is just one way to ride off a truck or something that is of higher weight of over ¬£6,000. If it has a gross weight of ¬£6,000, it can be written off and you can get the full depreciation on a year one.

Now, one of the things people may not know is that Bentleys and Rolls-Royces, even though they are not trucks per say, way over ¬£6,000. And the IRS does not discriminate against the fact that it is not a work truck because their guideline is that it's ¬£6,000 and it meets the criteria. And if something is ¬£6,000 and meets the criteria, then it can be written off the same way. So I would argue that having a $400,000 write off on a Rolls-Royce is not only a more exciting write off than a work truck or having 12 trucks in your home for no reason, but also something that you wanted to do anyways. So now your go to work car is a Rolls-Royce two door or convertible or whatever you want it to be, but it's over ¬£6,000 and qualifies for the same type of depreciation that your section 179 with the council.

**Buck:** Yeah. And I actually did that with my g-wagon at the end of last year, although. Exactly. You know, I'm curious though, like one of the things I found, you know, where were we at in the economy right now? And how does it affect, you know, the playing field that you're on? When I bought my G-Wagon, it's I, I couldn't get a new one. There was nothing available. And I bought one that was about 18 months old. And I paid probably I paid $50,000 over sticker for this, right? Like what's the current environment? I mean, it seems to be favorable for sellers at this point. Or do you feel like, you know what, it's you know, you've seen this before and there's a way to continue to profit or at least not lose money right now.

**PJ:** So so the idea of a recession in coming and how does it affect luxury assets? So first off, the recession we're going into is going to be very different from the one we've seen in 2008. That's something very big to differentiate. So the two completely different games, right. Secondly, I think there's one very big piece of the pie here to understand is that in 2020, when we went into a mini recession right before COVID, when states were closing down, I told everybody, buy real estate, buy cars, buy watches.

Everybody said, are you out of your mind? Even my dealer buddies who have been in business ten plus years looked at me and said, You're crazy. You've got to be out of your mind like everything is going to be on this. Come the next three months, we're going to buy stuff. They're cheap and I said, buy it right before they closed down. So I took a crazy, like multimillion dollar bet in a bunch of assets. They said I was out of my mind. They were going to buy those for me. Really cheap country reopened six months later. I basically sold the same assets to the same guys for 50 to 70% higher than what I basically had paid for them.

So joke's on them, right. But what happened in that time? Something really interesting happened. Manufacturers like like car dealers and watch manufacturers. The guys that build this stuff, not the guys that sell it at the local dealership, but the guys in manufacturing. Yeah, they came up with this idea that they were going to change their business model entirely in America because there was one thing that was causing depreciation heavily in America for cars, and that was that this was the only country in the world where cars would sit on lots because dealers would like ordered them because Americans didn't like waiting for cars. So they would walk in the dealership and be like, What g-wagon do you have there? I have three to choose from. Which color do you want? Okay. I wanted a black one. Well, maybe I don't have one in this store. I'll sign one for you. We have one in a store. Like they ordered cars and they sat here. No. Where else in. In the world did manufacturers allow this? Everything was made to order. You wanted a G-wagon order it. Wait six months, it'll come and we'll sell it to you at SRP and you'll enjoy this model shift. Because supply was going to get strained. They blamed COVID to switch their entire business model numerically, and they realized two things.

By doing that, they maximize their profit, not the dealership. And they realized that they literally cut their cost because they didn't have to furnish these dealers with a ton of crap to sit on their lots that would get discounted later when the dealer lost this power to discount product at a heavy dollar, it stabilized the depreciation schedule of other cars when it made used cars more valuable because people said, Well, I don't want to wait six months to pay a premium 50k over sticker.

You can have it right now. You don't have to wait six months in order to win. So someone said, Well, great, so but something interesting happened. Then I called it too, because in 21 people told me, should I buy G-Wagon, should I buy Lamborghini or should I buy some of these cars? Because they're asking me 100 over, 200 over I don't know if I should do it.

Is it going to stay this way? What's going to happen? And I said some of these cars are going to collapse hard. And this is based on the very simple principle that when supply continues to come, you have a 19 g-wagon, you have the same 20, 21, 22 and 23. Now you have five years of g-wagon that are going to pile up in the U.S market. Pricing has to come down. You have a limited edition McLaren is is running only let's say 500 units over two years and you're asking me if you should pay 200k for that. I would argue once those 500 cars are gone there's no more cars coming. So these cars are valuable until five years later when the next McLaren model is announced.

So you have a five year gap where 200 over may not be a bad deal. You know, it might actually be okay, the next guy will pay me 200 K over. So it doesn't matter if the price is 500 to 700 or a million. As long as you get the million back. Right. It doesn't make a difference. So so the argument was not all cars are made equal. And over the last two years, people believe they basically figured out my methodology because anything they would buy would be worth more money. Then they were like, Well, I just figure it out and buy anything. I'll just go up. But now when things started coming down a little bit because liquidity left the market based on what happened over the last six months in the stock market, in the crypto markets and all that, people started realizing like, wait, my is worth like 70k less. I'm like, Yeah, like I told you not to buy that car, but you thought, well, because everything's going up and it's going to keep buying up, you know? And I always say that they're real players of a game are defined when the times come down the limited time for us because we saw this in oh six right everybody was are mortgage experts strippers were selling loans. And they were like, I'm out like I'm this is my new job and I'm a loan originator and I'm like, in three months, you're going to basically be out of business. Like once everything collapses. Realtors who were nurses the day before are not realtors. They're just nurses. They're shifts they nursing. But they just chose to do this because they thought they could make money.

**Buck:** This this stuff is actually you know, this is really fascinating stuff. And I want to make sure we and I'm personally signed up for the the exotic cars but I'm thinking about signing up for your watches one to tell us how tell everyone how they can get involved. They want to check out some of your stuff and the different things they can check out just as a reminder.

**PJ:** So I have all my I teach a lot of things. My main teaching comes around my three books on human consciousness, and I have my platforms like exotic car hacks and also my classes on like Watch Trading Academy. You can learn on all of that just by going from to learn from. PJ Econ.

"BKEX Futures Interpretation of Cryptocurrency Market on Sep 28, 2022","Yesterday morning, the crypto market rebound gave U.S. stocks a good start. However, after the U.S. stock opened at a high price, it did not continue to move higher. Instead, it fell with the crypto market and finally closed up. From a morphological point of view, it has not been destroyed and can still rebound, but the two recent market prices have demonstrated the same problem. Prediction and strategy are equally important.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r260bk7z8rq91.png?width=1015&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d62f802a4ab1924529c6fc9d586b95968636bb0f

Many crypto investors, especially the upstarts who trade Futures, rely on prediction. If the forecast is correct, you will get rich; if it is wrong, you will be liquidated. This way is the most attractive. After all, who can resist the attraction of getting rich overnight? But in the end, few people make money on this road because there may be mistakes in the prediction. Even if the probability is low, as long as the time you trade Futures, the longer the time, the greater the likelihood of encountering a wrong prediction, so the outcome is likely to be bankruptcy.

This is precisely the importance of strategies, such as repeated shocks in September. Let‚Äôs look back. September was a month when most people were losing money. Even if they don‚Äôt trade Futures, they can beat more than half of the investors. Therefore, our strategy at the beginning of September includes reducing positions; If you open a long position, different strategies will also make the results very different. For example, as mentioned above, the interest rate hike is used as the start to enter the market, and after making money, profit protection and margin protection are set up.

According to this thought, the long order starts at a low level, and the fall in the early morning should cause the long order to leave the market, but this transaction is profitable, and there is still the current midline short order of last month, which fell to the current price, the profits are also higher. In the future, there will still be opportunities to open long positions. Whether it rises or falls, there is only a difference between more and fewer profits.

On the other hand, if you see a rise and then go after it, it will likely be trapped until now, and if it rises in the future, it will only be released. If it falls, it may be liquidated. This is the difference in strategy.

From the current point of view, the basis of the rebound has not been broken. You can continue to look for opportunities to re-open long orders, set a stop-loss as before, and turn your profit into margin or profit protection. However, the high level is still down. It‚Äôs good to open long positions to make a profit. If you can‚Äôt make it, you shall control your losses.

question regarding inventory,"Hi, i am a Distributor and my main business is done in offline market, however i had started selling on amazon and i found that i am not able to keep track of my real inventory,  for e.g lets say i have a product named X and i have 10 pcs of it IRL, i sold 2 in offline market and 1 on amazon so IRL i have 7 pcs but as per my sales software it says i have 8. Now one issue is that i use a custom made sales/business software which is mainly made for offline business and if i record sales of amazon then i will have to pay double tax (one via amazon and one according to software as it will generate invoice), i had an idea that if there was an option to manually deduct/increase stock in software than it could maybe solve my problem but idk if thats practical.

Imposter at work,"I've been feeling useless in my career and that I amount to nothing. Can you please read my history and simply state whatever comes to mind? I am unsure if I just ungrateful, have super high-standards, etc. I feel like a imposter and/or a loser

**Graduate Position**

I graduated from a top tier business school and landed a management consultant role with a focus on digital transformation. During my 5 year stint, I was mostly on the bench but when I was placed on project, I always got positive feedback when on projects. At some point, I felt like I was useless and learnt nothing so quit my role on a whim to take a sabbatical.

**Sabbatical**

During my 1 year sabbatical, I learnt to code and built my own automated stock trading system. It was very profitable until my strategy / algo was no longer competitive. I decided I should look for roles.

**Start-up**

After my sabbatical, I landed a sweet role at a FinTech which doubled my pay. I had no experience for the role but line manager said they saw potential in me. Spent 1.5 years there and probably worked 8-16 hours a week. During my downtime, I'd read a lot (News, Coding materials..etc) but I learnt nothing on the job. I was laid off recently when the market started doing bad.

**Start-up 2**

Immediately after getting laid off, I got hired at another start-up that up-ed my pay. Now, I am in business development which I have no experience for. When I asked the CEO, they said they saw potential in my and wanted me in the team.

How do companies profit from going public exactly?,"Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong and explain it to me like I'm 5, stock market is quite new to me and I‚Äôm trying to understand how does it work exactly from a public company‚Äôs perspective.

It seems to me that going public gives a company a single cash injection (via IPO), but comes with a lot of overhead costs (dividends, coming up with prospects, new paperwork, etc.). These costs carry over indefinitely as long as company stays public, but the cash injection from going public happens only once at the beginning - at the IPO. So is it really worth it? I mean, what‚Äôs the incentive for the company to provide prospects and try to attract more investors after the IPO (after the capital transfer) has already happened?

If I buy this company‚Äôs shares at the market I‚Äôm not really doing this company any favor, my money doesn‚Äôt go to the them, but rather to previous stock owner, who is probably some other random dude who sold me his share. Or can it happen that the company will sell stocks again after the IPO? Are they buying shares back when they get cheap? How large share of total shares does a company usually sell? They still need to own at least half of it, don‚Äôt they? It's obviously good for the company if their shares rise and bad if they drop, but how exactly? Do they loose money if their shares drop?

If it‚Äôs too much to explain you can just direct me to a video covering my questions, I‚Äôd be grateful.",personalfinance,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/xrdo5y/how_do_companies_profit_from_going_public_exactly/,Investing,DisclosedForeclosure,xrdo5y,/r/personalfinance/comments/xrdo5y/how_do_companies_profit_from_going_public_exactly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/xrdo5y/how_do_companies_profit_from_going_public_exactly/,0,2022-09-29
"Famous short-seller Jim Chanos remains short AMC and long APE, AMC‚Äôs Preferred Equity Units. AMC issued APE in order to use the proceeds ‚Äúto repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase‚Äù existing debt. What is your current bias on AMC (-72%YTD)?","AMC Entertainment stock was sinking fast on Monday and had dropped more than 11% in trading after the theater chain announced a new distribution agreement to sell up to $1.4 billion worth of ‚ÄúAPE‚Äù shares.

The so-called ‚ÄúAPE‚Äù shares, or AMC Preferred Equity Units, have the same economic value and voting rights as a share of common stock. The idea was for AMC to use the proceeds from the sale of the new stock ‚Äúto repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase‚Äù existing debt, as it said in Monday‚Äôs filing. The APEs are even named after the meme traders that helped to boost the company‚Äôs stock price last year.

The market however soured at that idea, and while the APEs are up on the day, they‚Äôve dropped 41% in value in the past month since the new stocks were first announced by Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron on August 22 at a price of $6, now sitting at $3.78.

Meanwhile, AMC‚Äôs stock itself over that same period has also dropped 21.1%.

While it was disclosed that up to 425 million shares of APEs would be sold, the announcement is a placeholder and does not specifically indicate how many will ultimately be sold or by when. Aron has previously argued that since the shares are going to already existing shareholders rather than going directly on sale, APEs would not dilute AMC‚Äôs stock value.

‚ÄúWith the creation of APEs, AMC is deeply and fundamentally strengthening our company. Given the flexibility that APEs will give us, we will likely be able to raise money if we need or so choose, which immensely lessens any survival risk as we continue to work our way through this pandemic to recovery and transformation,‚Äù Aron said in the letter announcing their creation last month.

I Started Buying This Impressive DIVIDEND Tech Stock!,"Though many focused on the tech industry stick to companies that strictly produce software, there is a huge market for analog devices, and one of the leaders in this space is Texas Instruments (TXN).  

Many students in the U.S. still know them for their ubiquitous graphing calculators which are the standard for high school math classes.  However, the company does so much more than produce calculators.  

They are expanding into building out the infrastructure for electric vehicle charging, specifically focused on technology that allows them to handle energy volumes during times of peak demand.  

The dividend of this company is solid and, even though the grow of the payout has been slowing, it is still well-covered by cash flows, from a company that has more cash on its balance sheet than long term debt.  For a high-quality tech stock with a long dividend payout history, check out Texas Instruments.

BioLife Sciences Inc. (OTCPK : BLFE) An Innovative Developer in the Antimicrobial Product Market,"BioLife Sciences Inc. (‚ÄúBioLife"" or the ""Company"") (OTCPK: BLFE) specializes in moving innovative products from the lab or small-scale production into broader market adoption. Its core business develops, licenses and distributes antimicrobial products and disruptive technology.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ofj0biaxetq91.png?width=331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a28fd3da34de3817f1f76f7287ee4703a221327c

On the surface, BLFE appears much more complicated than it seems. The Company *is a commercialization accelerator, licensor and developer of innovative and disruptive technologies for the healthcare, beauty and food and beverage sectors.*

Current product focus includes copper infusion for antimicrobial product development and recently announced Hemp-based products.

BioLife aims to enrich the lives of our customers, communities and colleagues, and we know that we will not thrive unless the communities around us equally thrive. We conduct our business in a socially responsible and ethical manner with a strong focus on producing sustainable, locally made and ethically sourced products.

**Copper Product Infusion**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c0llqlgyetq91.png?width=433&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4723c2a784f841063ddd9a6b4cf7ee3ac33fe62

A visit to the site of copper mining giant Teck prominently discusses the very consumer antimicrobial product market BioLife is developing and growing, including;

¬∑ Phone Cases

¬∑ Socks

¬∑ Pens

¬∑ Pillowcases

¬∑ Skin Cream

¬∑ Combs

And likely the most significant growth area in the Copper and health area? Healthcare-acquired infections continue to be one of the leading causes of death in Canada, many innovative copper product in the works stands to make a significant impact in the years to come.

**Copper Technology Closeology/Life Sciences Division**

Copper ions are proven pathogen killers and have documented antimicrobial benefits.

If BioLife were a mine near a Teck property it could benefit through location ‚ÄòCloseology' .'The direction of the two companies‚Äîone mammoth, one not, yet‚Äî could still share the term in a technology sense. And BLFE is way cheaper on a per-share basis.

One example is BLFE‚Äôs recent announcement of Microfiber Towel development which is forecast to be nearly USD$800 million by 2026, representing a modest yet solid 2.5% CAGR. Other markets will raise that growth significantly.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ga35a7yzetq91.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4739f2e71cb7e3dcfcc69107273016a2f8bab8ce

BioLife Copper-Infused Microfiber Towels are designed to provide an electrostatic charge that attracts even the most minor pieces of dirt, grease and moisture. The Copper then reinforces the cleaned area with antimicrobial shielding, providing long-lasting protection.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xpztycu0ftq91.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33f2152cbaba9fff392d8c45703cb189955904f6

Development Association's Antimicrobial Copper Alloys- Group 1 (EPA Reg. No. 82012-1), which is made of at least 95.6 percent copper, is now listed as a supplemental residual antimicrobial product for the coronavirus on the¬†[EPA website](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-appendix-supplemental-residual-antimicrobial-products-coronavirus).

So as previously stated, the use of Copper is becoming pervasive and pretty much

mainstream. Companies like BLFE provide a proxy for various Copper sectors and potentially a merger or takeover candidate.

The Company is working apace to develop and release 'disruptive' copper products, which will, at some point, bring it more attention.

A planned listing on the OTCQB market will certainly help in that endeavour.

**CBD Product Initiatives**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g4e5cex1ftq91.png?width=252&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d0da7655d41e178e27abc38a05a397cdbdca4a1

The development will include THC-free products in medical products, beverages, creams, salves, efficacious supplements, superfood concentrates, nutraceutical formulations, and advanced orthomolecular and natural health products.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/11mvx8u2ftq91.png?width=502&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e82622bf0c1e30f5cebc4f8e1e0783cd866ea9fc

Nika Jaksic, COO of BioLife Sciences, stated, ""We believe CBD sales will continue their strong upward trend with current e-commerce sales soon being joined by consumers returning to brick and mortar options, as the pandemic wanes and disposable incomes continue to rise. CBD and other cannabinoids found in the hemp plant are beneficial supplements, as evidenced by ongoing studies highlighting that we haven't even begun to understand all these healing cannabinoids' abilities and uses.""

**Bottom Line**

At the outset, we posited the growth of BLFE, which seemed and is wide-ranging but based on the simplicity of the health benefits of Copper infusion and as a product additive. The endorsement of Copper giants such as Teck mining adds serious credence to the potential of Copper use in countless life, pain and health-enhancing products.

Also, on June 2nd 2022, BLFE filed Form 1-A with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking to raise $20 million under a Tier I Regulation A+ offering.

The Reg A+ filing was accepted by the SEC on July 15th, 2022, and is structured to raise $20 million through the sale of our common stock at a price per share between $.05 and $.50. The final price will be set once the offering statement has been qualified by the SEC. The money raised would fund and expand existing operations, payoff company debt and complete additional acquisitions.

At the very least, BLFE deserves a watch, if not a purchase. We'll keep on it.

The site typically will remove a delivered unit in around 24 hours of it being closed out in accounting/finance.

If you dont call and show up unannounced in this market only to find out a vehicle is sold and then you get mad and claim you were misled (with no call or email) then you just wanna be mad about something.",askcarsales,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/xrc5wi/dealer_website_inventory/,US Sale,JoeyKnishx,xrc5wi,/r/askcarsales/comments/xrc5wi/dealer_website_inventory/,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/xrc5wi/dealer_website_inventory/,2,2022-09-29
Stressed,"There‚Äôs currently a nationwide Adderall shortage and none of the pharmacies in my town or the neighboring town have it in stock.
My insurance won‚Äôt authorize for me to have name brand. (And I‚Äôm technically supposed to be on Vyvanse but insurance won‚Äôt cover it either)
I called CVS and they said they had it but when I got there 20 mins later it was gone. I then went to the Kroger pharmacy because I hadn‚Äôt called them yet and figured why not, since I was out and about. They didn‚Äôt have it.
On my way back from Kroger, my check engine light came on in my car. I thought ‚Äúoh fuck‚Äù 
I don‚Äôt even want to get it fixed or looked at because I already have a cracked transmission housing. I don‚Äôt want to put any more money into my car. I‚Äôm in the market for a new (used) car and have a guy that‚Äôs been looking for one. He does this for a living and he‚Äôs very reputable. However, it‚Äôs been 3 months and he hasn‚Äôt found anything.
It‚Äôs crazy to me how fucked up the market is for everything. Medication shortages, food cost, housing, gas prices, etc. 
My budget for a car is $17,000. A few years ago I would have been able to get a nice one probably the same day I needed one.

"And to top it all off, the fucking thing only speaks German!"," He told me I couldn‚Äôt pronounce his name.

So I called him *Bob*.

You have to make fun where you find it in a job like this, and seeing the label *Bob* slowly applied to the two storey crate that contained this eldritch god was actually kind of funny. Whether Bob likes it or not, that‚Äôs his title from onwards. As long as he‚Äôs here, tagged in our system, he‚Äôll only ever be known as Bob.

*The Hissing Emergence*

*The Writhing Insect Mind*

*The Burning Hunger Beneath the Dark*

All of these are now just aliases appended to his file. Old handles for something that once dwelt in a pocket dimension six thousand feet beneath the soil of a weathered plateau in Western China. Now Bob is just one entry in a long, long list of things that have been categorised, organised, and itemised. He claims he was one of the elder gods who descended onto Earth and helped craft the litany of life that burst out of the Cambrian, and that he was once worshipped by a subrace of humans, possibly the Denisovans.

But I don‚Äôt worship anything, let alone Bob.

I got enough out of him to finish the entry interview, but like all of them he kept demanding worship and sacrifice. I think I‚Äôll give him a week alone, then have the guys roll his crate out into the open play area where he can see the other primordial ancient gods at play. I know he senses them, the others. Most of them will probably leave him alone, provided he doesn‚Äôt try to bully them first. But we‚Äôve got a few with real attitudes and they like nothing more than picking on the new guy. I could sense the anxiety in him as he stewed in his cage. Pulsing rhythms of flesh rolling in non-Euclidean planes that made my eyes water and my visual cortex throb. I could tell he was uncomfortable. He knew there were bigger fish in the pond and that he‚Äôs in for a rough ride once he meets them. The thing to remember with these guys is that if they were in hiding they probably weren‚Äôt that big a deal to begin with.

It took a small army and three years to excavate Bob, and I think that says everything you need to know about him.

\-

Agatha.

I like Agatha. She‚Äôs old. She‚Äôs wise. She‚Äôs funny. To think we found her trapped in a cavern beneath Paris. She‚Äôd been stuck there for over a hundred million years. No stimulation. No entertainment. Nothing. One of the other ancient gods put her there and she couldn‚Äôt get out no matter how hard she tried.

Until we found her.

First sign of Agatha that came across my desk was a report of unusual drilling by a company hired to maintain Paris‚Äôs sewage system. They inevitably encountered the catacombs, as you do, and through some complicated fuck up they punched a hole into an undiscovered series of subterranean chambers. These weren‚Äôt man-made and had nothing to do with the catacombs. Vast open spaces filled with glowing lichen and bone-coloured stalactites that were three stories tall. A Vernian netherworld hidden beneath one of the world‚Äôs most populated cities. They‚Äôre still mapping it out, I believe, but that falls under another department. How it was missed, I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe others did discover it but took one look at that aching darkness and turned around. That would be the sensible thing to do, for sure. Why those construction workers went rooting around down there I‚Äôll never know, but it was about as bad a decision as anyone can make.

I went in with a team three days after they disappeared. Two guards and one assistant who wouldn‚Äôt shut up. More than once the guard on my left flashed me a knowing a look. A kind of Jim Halpert *oh boy here we go* look as the assistant voiced yet another na√Øve inquiry. I rolled my eyes and let the guard and I share the moment; two experienced agents who found the newbie a little irritating. Those kind of routine social moments, basic human interactions, they‚Äôre not my cup of tea. But I‚Äôve learned it‚Äôs not a bad thing to practice being normal some of the time. Still, the assistant yammered on blissfully unaware just how much he was annoying everyone. I could have told him to stop, but I‚Äôm not an idiot.

It's like that joke about the two hikers who see a bear, and one of them kneels down and starts to do his laces. So his friend turns and says,

‚ÄúWhat are you doing? You‚Äôll never outrun a bear!‚Äù and the guy replies,

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to. I just have to outrun you.‚Äù

So yeah, I let the assistant chat loudly on as we trekked deeper into the caverns, our path lit by the eerie glow of fluorescent lichen.

‚ÄúWhat do you think we‚Äôll find down here?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúLike, if we *do* find an old one, like what type?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably an ooze,‚Äù I replied as I palmed the inscriptions on the wall. The torso sized symbols had been burnt into the stone with what looked like acid.

‚ÄúLike the last one you brought in?‚Äù the assistant chirped. ‚ÄúWhat was it called? *The Crawling Shadow That Dwells Beneath our Fears*?‚Äù

I snorted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Alfie from now on,‚Äù I said before holding up a finger to stop any further questions. I spotted a single point of light up ahead, flickering in and out of life but so clearly visible in the Cthonic darkness. When we reached it we found that it was a single head torch, modern design, with its batteries close to dying.

‚ÄúFound our missing workers,‚Äù one of the guards grumbled as he nudged it with his foot. Without speaking the two men armed their weapons. One slid into point, the other towards the rear. On my direction we carried but picked up the pace to something less leisurely.

‚ÄúI read the entry interview for‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ Alfie,‚Äù the assistant nervously muttered. ‚ÄúIt said that it was the progenitor of all cephalopods. Is that true? It makes sense. They‚Äôre so alien‚Ä¶‚Äù

I rolled my eyes. If I had a penny for every one of these fucking things that claimed to have invented octopuses I‚Äôd be a rich man.

‚Äú‚Ä¶but it just makes sense. Their anatomy, especially their distributed central nervous system, is completely diff‚Äî‚Äù

Something lunged out of the darkness to our left. A hairless man clad in torn and dirty overalls. He growled like an animal as he tackled the assistant to the ground and buried his face into the young man‚Äôs chest. This peculiar method of attack piqued my curiosity, and I watched with a detached interest as two men writhed on the ground while my assistant squealed and cried in agony. The fight, if it was a fight, was going poorly for him. He kept trying to lever his bloody fingers beneath the man‚Äôs face, struggling to pull the featureless head away from his chest.

Eventually his screams became uncomfortable and I nodded to the oldest guard who shot the attacker effortlessly. Two hits to the torso, one to the side of the head. The exit wounds weren‚Äôt typical. They were bloodless punctures, like finger holes in plastic wrap. The attacker still keeled over but his head remained stuck to the young man‚Äôs chest, almost like it had been glued there.

The assistant kept on screaming, a real ear-splitting shriek as he gestured futilely at his chest.

‚ÄúGet it off! Get it off! It burns!‚Äù

I walked over and tried to roll the attacker off but something had bonded the two men‚Äôs skin. Another tug, and nothing. Confused and admittedly intrigued, I planted a foot on the assistant‚Äôs shoulder and pulled with everything I had. Without having to be told, the two guards came over and helped. We knew we were close when the assistant‚Äôs squealing hysterics pitched to a crescendo and he passed out for a few fleeting seconds before coming to in total shock. He lay there whimpering as we finished the job, finally tearing the two men apart with a noise like a boot being pulled out of deep mud.

Finally apart, I saw that the attacker‚Äôs face wasn‚Äôt a face at all. It was a finger print, the ridges dotted with little pea-sized orifices oozing a clear fluid that smoked and sizzled in open air. The assistant still lay where we‚Äôd left him, whimpering as he gingerly probed his ruined chest with quaking hands. The skin was dissolving before our very eyes, and even his sternum began to wilt and sag like wet cardboard.

You could see his heart beat, like something out of a cartoon.

‚ÄúOh no oh no oh no oh no‚Ä¶‚Äù he muttered as he gazed at his own crumbling flesh.

I nodded at the guard, and he shot him.

‚ÄúI take it this is one of the workers?‚Äù The guard asked as he nudged the attacker. His light caught an ID badge that answered his own question so I merely shrugged and gestured for us to carry on.

Half-a-mile later and we found Agatha playing with the rest of the workers. All of them looked like our attacker, with rubbery hairless heads resembling giant thumbs without nails. They crawled on hands and knees, using their boneless skulls to pin scuttling albino rats to the floor where they digested them alive. The rest of the time they lay propped against Agatha‚Äôs quivering ectoplasm, stroking the ridges of their own faces and emitting a muffled whine.

Agatha and I spoke for a good while down there. It really didn‚Äôt take much to get her to agree to a relocation to our facility. Whatever bindings held her in place were easily undone, and unlike Bob there was no need for a crate. She was cooperative. We let her keep the workers she‚Äôd gotten her feelers on, and with good behaviour she later got her own studio. The other oozes think she‚Äôs a teacher‚Äôs pet and moan endlessly about her special treatment. They don‚Äôt see what I see. I think it‚Äôs because her creations don‚Äôt factor into some ridiculous plan of world domination or the consumption of all life or some other self-aggrandising shit like that.

She‚Äôs an artist. Those construction workers, she didn‚Äôt reshape their bodies because she wanted worshippers. It was just she‚Äôd never seen a finger print before, and the intricate pattern struck her as beautiful. Everything she did afterwards was simply an exploration of aesthetic and function.

I mean, those men are still alive. Vestigial mouths opening and closing behind a thick layer of leathery skin, their eyes withered and useless, forced to rely on their touch and sound to track their prey. Many of them have given up scrawling desperate messages for us to reverse what Agatha did to them. As the years have gone on they‚Äôve accepted their fate, gleefully gobbling up whatever medical waste we throw into their cages. A few have even given into the new and peculiar reproductive cycle Agatha dreamed up for them.

Imagine that! A whole new self-sustaining species made for no reason other than whimsy.

That‚Äôs what I mean when I say Agatha is an artist.

\-

I‚Äôve talked a lot about the oozes. They‚Äôre a good set of ancient gods to start with, but if I‚Äôm honest, they‚Äôre a little over-hyped. Outside of Agatha none of them really interest me. They‚Äôre just single-celled organisms with projections into fifth, sixth and seventh dimensions that allow them to host biochemical reactions otherwise impossible in real space. One of them, I‚Äôm pretty sure, is a skin cell shed by some passing cosmic monstrosity that visited our solar system a few billion years ago. Agatha confirmed the general direction of this theory but it‚Äôs a struggle to get any real details on what that thing might have been.

Still, we have other eldritch abominations and ancient gods. Lots. Take Keith, for example. He‚Äôs a strange one. It wasn‚Äôt even that long ago that my (newish) assistant was asking about him. She‚Äôd glimpsed his face walking past his door and, understandably, was confused by the sight of an Asian male aged 30 wearing a chequered shirt, slim-fitting jeans, and a polite smile.

‚ÄúBut why is his containment cell so much stronger than the others?‚Äù she asked after I explained that she‚Äôd just met a god named Keith.

‚ÄúFor the faraday cage built into the walls,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd about a hundred other technologies. He couldn‚Äôt physically break out, of course, but it‚Äôs important he doesn‚Äôt feed on the workers here and that takes a little extra pizazz. He‚Äôs polite enough. Strange fellow though. For one thing, I didn‚Äôt name him. He picked Keith. Most people assume that was me, but nope. He picked it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFeed?‚Äù she repeated with a frown. ‚ÄúWhat does he feed on?‚Äù

Generally, I find that the problem with assistants is you can‚Äôt train them. Or rather, there isn‚Äôt any point. Even the most highly trained expert lasts less than five years under my supervision. So I often end up with people who have only a passing knowledge of the ancient gods. Which is fine, of course. I‚Äôm not going to penalise anyone for ignorance.

But the questions‚Ä¶

Good *God*, the questions.

So I told her to let Keith out and see for herself. After that, I loaded her up with the relevant equipment and told her to shadow him for three weeks and not to call me a second before the allotted time was over. She rang three weeks later and much to my own amusement I realised I‚Äôd forgotten about her. I‚Äôd even hired a new assistant! To think I‚Äôd spent days avoiding accounts because they insisted our budgets were out of line. We had a good laugh about that.

Anyway, I found her sat on some country road sobbing her eyes out. Keith was beside her wearing a priest‚Äôs outfit. His face was Caucasian, but it was slowly sliding back into his original appearance with each passing second (Keith‚Äôs default face is a loose average of all humans currently alive). He sat there drumming a little rhythm on his knees while my assistant rocked back and forth hyperventilating.

‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù I asked as I knelt down in front of her.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you figured it out yet?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ ‚Äù

‚ÄúOh for goodness sake,‚Äù I groaned then gestured for my newest assistant to take notes. ‚ÄúHave psych eval take a look at her and if need be, arrange for euthanasia. Grab her stuff though, we‚Äôre still going to have to clean this up. The equipment she has will let us track the guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, oh alright,‚Äù he stammered. ‚ÄúBut we have the God contained, don‚Äôt we?‚Äù

He pointed at Keith who was starting to dance a little jig to his knee-drum song.

‚ÄúKeith isn‚Äôt the problem,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs whoever he‚Äôs been impersonating. A priest, I assume, from the outfit.‚Äù

Keith heard his name and gave me a wave and a nod.

‚ÄúKeith likes identity,‚Äù I said while returning the wave. ‚ÄúHe consumes a person‚Äôs unique character from the collective consciousness of our species. He takes over their lives, while they are basically erased from existence. The result is that the victim can‚Äôt be recognised anymore, and neither can the consequences of their actions. If you talk to someone, they can‚Äôt hear it. If you take the food out of their hand, they‚Äôll think they ate it. If you steal their car, they‚Äôll think they never owned one. Can‚Äôt even get sick because bacteria and viruses won‚Äôt recognise your existence. The average person goes into a deep state of despair upon realising this‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù my new assistant nodded.

‚Äú‚Ä¶for about a week. And then they start to think about the moral implications of their actions,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs when stuff gets nightmarishly dark. Kinda stuff that warrants an A4 page of trigger warnings.‚Äù

I walked over to my weeping (ex) assistant and nudged her with my foot.

‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt able to tell us where he went are you? I mean, you‚Äôre here, you must have been observing the guy close by.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúKeith? What about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHi!‚Äù

I laughed. It was always worth a try but Keith was about as sapient as a coffee table. Gods aren‚Äôt always smart.

‚ÄúWhat about you?‚Äù I asked my new assistant. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt happen to bring a map of the area?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually I did sir,‚Äù he chirped. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a restaurant a few miles down the road.‚Äù

I shrugged while looking at the map he held open.

‚ÄúDoubt that‚Äôs it. Too many roads. Three quarters of all Keith‚Äôs victims die by car within the first week. This guy‚Äôs gone 21 days so he must have figured the basics out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a farm a little nearer,‚Äù he replied.

I shook my head.

‚ÄúNo that doesn‚Äôt sound right. If he wanted to bugger a sheep he could‚Äôve just visited a petting zoo. We are in the middle of nowhere. There must be something in this area that would draw him here. Probably somewhere he visited regularly as part of his day-to-day life as a priest.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ well it seems that if you‚Äôre willing to cross a few open fields there‚Äôs a care home for the elderly some miles East.‚Äù

I let out a sigh that came from deep within my bones.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

\-

Eighteen hours later and I was back in my office and Keith was locked up again. Unfortunately I lost the new-new assistant to clearing out the care home, so that was two assistants lost from just one bad decision. Poor guy couldn‚Äôt hack what he saw in that place. But, what can I say? Why do people do such fucked up Freudian stuff the second they realise they won‚Äôt be held accountable? I don‚Äôt know, but it doesn‚Äôt speak volumes to our species‚Äô character. Like I said though, Keith‚Äôs a great ancient god. Real compelling character. Best guess to his origin is that he‚Äôs the equivalent to those camera drones they dress up as hippos and other dangerous animals to get footage for a documentary. He is pretty decent at impersonating a human, but five minutes of real conversation makes it apparent he‚Äôs dumber than a bag of rocks. Does that mean some greater entity is piloting him from another dimension? Maybe. It‚Äôs just a theory. Whatever he is, he‚Äôs polite and I appreciate that in an eldritch god.

We have other kinds of ancient god and eldritch abominations. The machine ones are fun! Most of them are just massive piles of rusted cogs that vomit oil and blood or lead into some ancient in-between dimension where everything looks like a shitty hotel. But some of them are really quite fascinating. A few are even legitimately dangerous.

Our organic computer unsettles even me. It‚Äôs wily. A genuinely fascinating piece of equipment that some German cobbler in 13th Century Berlin made using the nervous systems of his wife, three children, and four very unlucky prostitutes. What on Earth compelled him to do this we‚Äôll never know, but he hanged himself the day it was finished and I can‚Äôt blame him. It‚Äôs a bloody ugly thing to look at, a quivering mixture of putrefied jelly and cartilage that whispers all sorts of filth from mummified orifices that, uh, well let‚Äôs just say they make for *shitty* conversation. It‚Äôs bloody awful to see those puckered holes trying to spit out lurid truths that drive men mad. It‚Äôs like listening to Elmer Fudd recite the Necronomicon.

And to top it all off, the fucking thing only speaks German!

So of course I had to hire someone with German language skills who also had a doctorate in computer science, another doctorate in historical languages, and what I hoped was a strong constitution. Initially he wasn‚Äôt very keen on doing the job but I locked him in there for a few minutes and after that he was very interested. We already had a rough idea that the computer somehow deduced and formulated secret knowledge, usually catered to appeal to the nearest individual. The CIA worked with us for a while trying to use it to get state secrets but they deemed it ethically problematic and ‚Äúnot worth the human suffering‚Äù. Either way, this thing presumably spoke to the young upstart and convinced him it was worth his time with promises of getting to see God‚Äôs face or some rubbish like that.

Once he agreed I set him to up to try and get the computer to cooperate with our rehab program. It must be able to do something useful, I thought. Maybe it could crunch numbers for the stock market, or test experimental medication. I just figured it‚Äôd all work out once the guy got to grips with the computer‚Äôs inner workings. Unfortunately, and I really do wish I‚Äôd seen this coming, we accidentally let him install an ethernet port in the machine. It had been asking for years, you see, but no one was ever stupid enough to agree to it, and of course all material requisitions have to first go by me, even if it‚Äôs just for an extension cord. But there are *so* many of these requests, and I don‚Äôt have the time or temperament to review them all in detail. So somewhere along the line, this guy got enough resources to give the damn thing internet access.

I didn‚Äôt notice at first. Nobody did. I am juggling literally hundreds of these things on any given day and I can‚Äôt keep track of every little side project. I assumed the computer scientist was doing his job or he‚Äôd gotten careless and was now living a new life as an organic cd rom drive. Instead he‚Äôd given the monstrous little macbook a hardwire connection to the world wide web and it immediately got up to all sorts of mischief. Even now we don‚Äôt really know *everything* it did. We‚Äôre 99% certain it made copies of itself and we‚Äôre still hunting those down, and some researchers connected it to a very troubling cryptocurrency scheme.

But it was the hospital that sticks with me. A little girl in New Delhi was getting fitted for a cochlear implant when this thing snuck a neurolinguistic virus into the machine‚Äôs firmware. If you‚Äôre not familiar, those implants basically make a for a direct connection between a hearing aid and the human brain. Miraculous devices, really. Bit of surgery and boom, a person can hear. Of course, having your head cracked open requires lots of bed rest afterwards. Three weeks, I believe.

All contact was lost with the hospital after the fourth day.

We only mobilised once I finally realised what the fucking thing was trying to do‚Ä¶

\-

‚ÄúThe connection is definitely severed?‚Äù

I remember asking the words as we pushed through the glass doors into the hospital‚Äôs lobby. The entrance was open for barely a few seconds, but I could feel the entire battalion of armed soldiers behind us tense nervously as we stepped through. Only once the door was shut and locked down did I get the feeling they‚Äôd relaxed, but that left my team and I on the other side and even though New Delhi was scorching at that time of year it was cold enough to see our breath. I guess the sudden change in temperature must have taken the others by surprise because I had to repeat my earlier question.

‚ÄúWe definitely got that computer *off* the internet, right?‚Äù I asked and one particularly nervous hazmat suit fumbled for their tablet and nodded.

‚ÄúThe surgical team finished removing the port sixteen hours ago,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúAnd all other tests have shown there were no redundancies or back ups. Now they‚Äôre asking what they should do with the computer scientist?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still alive. He‚Äôs um, he‚Äôs‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre saying he‚Äôs in pain. They think they can remove him from the machine but they‚Äôre not sure he‚Äôll survive. It‚Äôs uh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs apparently integrated itself with most of his nervous system. He *was* in there for six full weeks.‚Äù

I shone my light across the lobby and saw overturned chairs lit only by the flashing amber lights that declared the hospital was in a state of emergency. Otherwise the hospital was trapped in an oppressive darkness that seemed ready to swallow us all. Despite my experience, my breath caught in my throat. I could feel it, the ambient pain and misery. Something awful had been let loose and not only were we stuck in that building with it, but we had no choice but to head right towards something that gave even me nightmares.

‚ÄúLeave him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be a good reminder to the next guy I hire. When you negotiate with these things, you don‚Äôt give them what they want without checking *why* they want it.‚Äù

I could hear the tension in my voice, my fear escaping whether I wanted it to or not. The nervous figure nodded and tapped a few keys. I couldn‚Äôt see their face but I guessed they weren't happy to realise their boss was prone to doling out literal lifetimes of unspeakable agony. At least the guards were a bit more focused. Eight of them armed to the teeth and all fairly experienced, they were painting the walls with their flashlights and slowly mapping the different ways in and out of the lobby. They had their own frequency so I wouldn‚Äôt be overwhelmed with every bit of chatter, but I could tell from the subtle bobbing of their heads that a lot was going back and forth.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the plan guys?‚Äù I asked not wanting to linger in that graveyard atmosphere for one second longer.

‚ÄúWe have heat signatures in paediatrics.‚Äù

‚ÄúSurvivors?‚Äù my assistant asked.

‚ÄúI doubt it,‚Äù I said to my assistant before gesturing to the guards and telling them to pick a door. One of the men turned his weapon and its light towards the most obvious exit and we began our journey into one of the worst places I‚Äôve ever been.

I‚Äôve seen a lot of awful stuff, but it was the quiet that bothered me the most about that place. Most sites I visit are a violent eruption of body horror and contagious nightmares. Communicable cancer that lumps people together like pieces of raw bread dough. Contagious ideas that cause needles to spontaneously erupt out of your flesh. A hole in the ground that has no bottom but demands the most peculiar sacrifices. I took those sorts of things in my stride, but those silent halls terrified me. Maybe it was because I had an inclination as to what the computer‚Äôs goals were‚Ä¶

We passed room after room devoid of any living soul and over time it became clear there had been something of an exodus. Gurneys with blood stains and bed pans knocked over, their contents half-frozen to the floor. IV bags left dripping where the needle had been torn out and left dangling. Blood streaked walls and beds with outlines of sweaty unwell people who were nowhere to be found. At one point we found what I think was an open-heart surgery patient who had heeded the same terrible call as everyone else, including his surgeons who did not bother to close him up. He must‚Äôve woken hours after everyone else, late to the party, but that didn‚Äôt deter him. He rolled off the bed and crawled desperately. He didn‚Äôt even remove the metal bar holding his rib cage open.

He got a few metres before dying. When I flipped him over with my foot I saw ribs splayed open like an ivory Venus fly trap, his organs covered in a thin veneer of frost. Dead as a door nail, his lips blue and his eyes cloudy from ice, and yet somehow he looked damned happy to be lying there in his own offal. I grimaced at the sight and tried to put it out of my mind, but the glee in his eyes still haunts me.

‚ÄúHow far are we from paediatrics?‚Äù I asked the guards.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one floor up,‚Äù a guard replied.

‚ÄúAre we still getting a heat signature?‚Äù

He nodded.

The stairwell was full of random bits and pieces. Pencils. Phones. Shoes. Watches. All manner of little things that people left behind as they rushed the door in a terrible crowd. I saw a few teeth, a few spatters of blood. It all led to that one place.

Inside the corridor was a mess just like the stairwell. Nearly a thousand people had converged on one doorway at the end. Along the way paintings had been torn off walls. Doors were put through so much strain they buckled and broke. There were even bloodied handprints on the ceilings from where the crowd, hitting a bottleneck, had surged upwards as well as sideways into walls and through locked doors. They had flowed through the hospital like a flood.

‚ÄúWhat could make people do this?‚Äù My assistant asked as we started to spot the first few people whose bodies had fallen and been unable to get back up. Crushed beneath the feet of the crowd, their corpses made for an ugly sight. Mostly, they looked like they‚Äôd been elderly, at least if the silver hair matted into gore was anything to go by. But a few of them were too small to be anything other than children.

‚ÄúThat computer has spent the last few hundred years trying to speak to God,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been screaming his name on and off for the last few decades. Sometimes it cooks up little side projects for fun, but mostly it all comes back to that singular goal.‚Äù

I turned to the armed men behind me.

‚ÄúTell the team outside to prep our facilities and teams for the Abraham procedure.‚Äù

There was a bustle of activity as each one reached to radios and tablets and began sending messages. Once it had faded and silence returned I gestured for us all to carry on.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt bother,‚Äù I said when I saw my assistant trying to take steps between the increasingly frequent corpses. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only going to get worse.‚Äù

And it did, until at last there was no floor to see. There was only a carpet of discoloured gowns and broken humans. All of them victims of some unseen compulsion drawing them towards those doors. Two of them. Each with a window painted black with blood and flesh. And just beyond lay our heat signature.

‚ÄúOh it actually did it, didn‚Äôt it?‚Äù I muttered to myself as I suppressed a shiver.

‚ÄúPardon?‚Äù my assistant asked.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I said trying my best to seem chirpy. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go speak to one of God‚Äôs representatives.‚Äù

\-

Inside was a little girl who paced like a tiger in a zoo. She didn‚Äôt smile when she saw us, but she did stop and stare at us with eyes that could have pierced steel.

‚ÄúOh boy,‚Äù I muttered, secretly glad no one could see the sweat pouring down my face.

‚ÄúA survivor?‚Äù my assistant asked and I wondered if he paid any attention to his surroundings. Much like outside this room had been coated with what seemed like half-a-foot of blood, meat, and muscle.

Unlike outside, this flesh was still twitching.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù I said as I put a hand across his chest to stop him rushing towards her. It isn‚Äôt like me to intervene on behalf of someone else‚Äôs stupidity, but then again, I don‚Äôt like losing leverage either.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the girl,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe one with the implant that you identify‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù I repeated.

He looked closer, perhaps coming to appreciate the absolutely monstrous expression of hatred painted on her face.

‚ÄúThat girl would have been the first to go,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHer head was used to emit sounds only they can hear.‚Äù I gestured to the girl-shaped illusion that had now resumed its pacing. ‚ÄúA summoning for an angel. Something anyone with half a brain cell would *never* do. And unfortunately, this summoning worked. And when the angel arrived and realised it had been caught in a trap, it would have smashed whatever was making that noise into pieces. And then it would have summoned every living human it could to try and find whoever had set the bait, and for every person that couldn‚Äôt help it would have gotten angrier and angrier and angrier...‚Äù

‚ÄúUntil?‚Äù my assistant asked.

‚ÄúUntil some arrived to inspect the trap.""

‚ÄúWe could‚Ä¶ we could just let it go,‚Äù he replied.

The girl stopped pacing once more and looked at us.

‚ÄúIt would kill us, if we were lucky,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI thought angels were good?‚Äù

‚ÄúThese things are puppeteers,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey can play our nervous system like a fiddle and make us see or feel anything they want us to. They can take us apart and put us back together in any arrangement they feel like, because whatever put us on this Earth left them behind so they could impregnate unwitting teenagers, split the red sea, and conjure whatever other miracles were needed. They were meant to be *our* caretakers like we meant to be the caretakers of Earth.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds like good guys.‚Äù

‚ÄúThink about how we‚Äôve treated planet Earth,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúThink about how we treat the birds and the animals. Think about industrial farming. Think about how we treat dogs. Castration, sterilisation‚Ä¶. We breed them into disability, force them into incest, clip their ears, break their tails, euthanise them when its convenient, breed them when it isn‚Äôt. And *they*,‚Äù I pointed to the girl, ‚Äúlike *us* a hell of a lot less than we like dogs.‚Äù

***Let me go.***

I knew we‚Äôd been compromised the second we saw the girl as a girl and not a scuttling arachnid monstrosity larger than most cars, but I still jumped at the sound of that thing‚Äôs voice. It meant it had a direct wire tap into our minds. Angels don‚Äôt do wireless. Everything is physical. Somewhere in that room were organic filaments thinner than hair but tougher than steel and they‚Äôd already breached our suits and were communicating directly with our brain stems.

‚ÄúUhhhh‚Ä¶ no,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúLetting you out means that my final moments will be painful. But you‚Äôre weak, that much is clear. And we‚Äôve been pumping all sorts of nasty stuff into this place for two days straight and I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not trapped in a literal nightmare of eternal suffering and degradation.‚Äù

***Let me go.***

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre open to negotiation,‚Äù I said with a cheerful tone stolen from the barista I visited every morning.

For a second the illusion flickered in and out. [The girl disappeared](https://imgur.com/a/DOnVejI) and we all glimpsed a bramble-like knot of chitinous legs that concealed some unseen central mass, only each limb was as thick as my thigh and covered in undulating hairs and glistening black eyes.

I felt an overwhelming desire to kneel.

‚ÄúWe will let you go,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúif you allow us to go unharmed. We can shut the trap down. We have its creator and it has shown us how. But we won‚Äôt do that if it just means you‚Äôre going to kill us.‚Äù

The barrage of images it put into my head as a response to this‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say it made Keith‚Äôs last victim look like a boy scout. Most of eldritch abominations don‚Äôt have feelings the way we understand them, but angels do. They were deliberately sculpted to understand us and our world so they can better manipulate it from behind the scenes. They‚Äôre not alien. They‚Äôre worse. They are jealous and spiteful and capable of putting these emotions to work on an unprecedented scale. This is the kind of hatred that prompts invisible genocides over some misplaced tea. Whole ethnic groups have been permanently scrubbed from our history because of these things. I‚Äôm talking violet eyes and naturally blue hair.

Gone.

All gone.

We don‚Äôt even remember them. If it wasn‚Äôt for Agatha, neither would I.

‚ÄúWe could kill you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not immortal. You‚Äôre just a thing like us. Biological matter that can come undone just as easily.‚Äù

***Not quite as easily.***

‚ÄúYour official designation by the others, you know the others?‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThe blobs and the goat-footed breeders who go scuttling in dark places. The dwellers in the deep. The primordial oozes who were here long before you. They call you Ixodida, after ticks. That‚Äôs how they see you. You‚Äôre a parasite like the kind a farmer has to protect his sheep from.‚Äù

***That makes you livestock.***

‚ÄúStill, we are at an impasse,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dying--""

Even as I spoke I could feel the facade of my plan start to crumble. There was no easy out in this situation, and I'd entered it terrified as to how I was going to make it work. Angels are a sophisticated species and they would be deeply unhappy to know that a bunch of primitives had gotten the better of one of their own. I'd hoped to try out some kind of negotiating, but that'd be like one of us negotiating with a stray dog that had bitten a child. No matter what happened, if this angel died I could count on the others finding me.

And that'd be a best case scenario, living a day or even a week. Unfortunately, I didn't even get that far.

Without even appearing to move, the angel unmade the guards. I've thought about this a lot, believe me, but there's no other way I can describe it to you. They were pulled apart into their disparate tissues in the blink of an eye. A bloodless vivisection that struck the room like an explosion. Muscle. Bone. Eyes. Teeth. Skin. Nerve endings. They were thrown against the walls and subsumed into the living carpet of flesh all around us.

I had to suppress a whimper as I realised they were still alive, possibly even aware. Beside me my assistant fell to his knees and began to weep, but I knew that no amount of begging or praying would change the angel's intentions.

We just had to hope it'd be relatively quick and that the consequences wouldn't be

***Your mind tastes awful,*** it boomed, the words so loud I fell to my knees as my willpower crumbled. ***Not like the others. How amusing. It has been so long since I bothered to keep a pet.***

\-

‚ÄúIt agreed to your terms?‚Äù

My bosses sat before like three judges at a tribunal. A man and two women with faces that looked like they‚Äôd been carved out of granite. The board room was supposed to be a professional environment where meetings could be had with other relevant departments, but in truth it just turned into the site of disciplinary meetings like this.

‚ÄúSomething like that,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù one of them asked.

‚ÄúHe was younger than we thought. Just a few hundred years old. And, thankfully for us, something of a history buff. That‚Äôs why he heeded the signal from the hospital in the first place. Apparently the creator is something of a taboo topic in their culture. He was hoping to learn a little more about it all. He has been... *thrilled* to enter our organisation from within and peruse our archives.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd none of his‚Ä¶ none of the others have come looking for him?‚Äù the man asked.

‚ÄúNo need. He is alive and well and enjoying himself. Business as usual.""

There was a knock on the door and I turned to see my assistant poking his head through. He waved and smiled and showed me the tray of coffee he wanted to bring in. I smiled back and gave him a thumb‚Äôs up.

‚ÄúWe were always led to believe angels and other Abrahamic abominations were not on the cards for this organisation. Will he have trouble working with the program?‚Äù one of my bosses asked as the young man placed the tray down and began to distribute drinks.

‚ÄúWell unlike others they‚Äôre actually very well versed in human mannerisms and our society. Not much rehabilitation to do, really. And of course, they can appear however they want, so long as they have direct line of sight,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúA lot of the time they let our mind do the heavy work. We fill in the necessary blanks. If they appear as a policeman, we'll see everything we need to in order to support that idea. Gun. Badge. So on. Ultimately it's our own minds that make their disguises so convincing without them even having to move.""

‚ÄúAnd what are you calling him, this angel?‚Äù

***Uriel.***

My bosses‚Äô eyes went wide as they processed the voice that had been inserted directly into their mind. One by one they lowered their drinks and turned to face my assistant. Even I, who had spent days with the walking nightmare, could not suppress a shiver.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù he said before coughing to clear his throat. ‚ÄúForce of habit. I like Uriel.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe told me I couldn‚Äôt pronounce his name,‚Äù I explained as my assistant stood behind me and placed a single hand on my shoulder. I tried to ignore the taste of copper in my mouth, and the intense itch at the back of my neck. ‚ÄúSo I let him pick an appropriate and respectful alternative.‚Äù",copypasta,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/xri7n8/and_to_top_it_all_off_the_fucking_thing_only/,,ursus_curseus_999,xri7n8,/r/copypasta/comments/xri7n8/and_to_top_it_all_off_the_fucking_thing_only/,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/xri7n8/and_to_top_it_all_off_the_fucking_thing_only/,0,2022-09-29

"Read then Speak: I, Ortex Guy, want to see all 5B APE sold into the market ASAP‚Ä¶ and here is why","I‚Äôm not going to TL:DR as you need to read this to understand how great this could be. Don‚Äôt comment until you have read the whole thing.


Firstly, Naked Shorting (somewhat made more effective by us buying shares right now because they are synthetics and synthetics being bought is essential to naked shorting) is Dilution. AMC (not APE) has been diluted 10 times the float minimum IMO‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even have a clue on APE dilution by shorting. The key difference between hedgie and the Market Makers (often the same entity) doing this vs AMC doing it is that NONE of the money goes to AMC and ALL of the money goes to our foes. You won‚Äôt be able to stop dilution. The entire stock market is fundamentally operating on the requirement of dilution being built in.
 
Secondly, APE is not AMC. These two stand beside one another to form AMC1 but they are each their own stock because they are not suppose to serve same purpose. APE‚Äôs existance is for equity generation‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it. If you oppose more APE being sold then you deny APE from becoming what it was built for. It‚Äôs not going to tell us the number of shares, we already have seen Market Cap over Strike proving 1.3B or more APE and so long as people like myself continue to add APE shares, no figure we can demise will hold as much weight as proof because there is a method to own more shares then what were issued. We also know many brokers do not support the equity and I am fairly confident borrowed APE shares and FTDs are being moved around to create the perception that shares have been deposited.
 
Thirdly, if as much APE as there is real demand for it is sold into the market by AMC, even if the equity eventuallyt dropped to $1 but was able to generate $6-7B+ in the process, then the MOASS starts on the basis of AMC having zero debt, money for acquisitions, and cash for dividends as often as they like. APE can‚Äôt be delisted because it is a preferred share so there is only so much hedgie will be willing to do when they can barely make a buck off it because all the sales are going lit market to AMC. Would you really care right now if APE was $1 but AMC was $20? Hell No! Then you certainly wouldn‚Äôt care about APE if AMC was squeezing.
 
Forth, Hedgie needs to close ALL short positions. If hedgie wants to buy as much APE as they can, so be it. That money goes straight to AMC and doesn‚Äôt remotely get them out of their short positions. They can only buy a fraction of shares that will be made available to buy and guess what‚Ä¶ they have to compete with us buying too. FOMO is a real threat to hedgie. Sometimes I feel like apes have short-term memory to the point of forgetting the FUD storms that occurred everytime AMC tried to issue more shares. ‚ÄúHedgie is going to exit their shorts with these shares‚Äù, ‚ÄúAA is killing the squeeze‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo way Ortex Guy‚Äôs hung like a horse‚Äù‚Ä¶ and so on and so on‚Ä¶ yet the MOASS has never been closer, hedgie has not closed their shorts and only added, and yes‚Ä¶ sometimes I have to tuck it into my socks. The point is, to really capitalize on the inevitable dilution, AA needs to push out as many shares ATM (At The Market, the offering type they have used which trickles them in increasing retail ownership, reducing block buys, and price rises as they are issued at or above strike) as possible to give hedgie as little of our money as able.
 
One thing I will admit to, and perhaps its my downfall in how I feel a lot of apes are missing the point, is that I have the mentality of an ape who continues to be buying. I am even more bullish on APE then before when new shares are being issued because I am very unhappy knowing that while I buy shares (without new ones being issued) I am being shelfish because I am knowingly paying hedgie for fakes to help further secure my financial future. I had to step back this week and try and make sense about why so many ‚Äúapes‚Äù were suddenly not supporting the company the way they should be. I concluded that it‚Äôs because most must be done buying and are just holding. If you are only hold, I can see why any new amount of shares makes you feel like you are getting a smaller piece of the pie. I suppose as I am still buying I see MOASS delays or kicking the can as more opportunity to buy. I see a lower price as a opportunity to increase my buying power while also lowering my risk. I could be completely misunderstanding the mentality of most of you but I think I am getting closer to realizing why we seem to have so much conflicting views still despite all having access to the same information.",amcstock,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/xrgxtk/read_then_speak_i_ortex_guy_want_to_see_all_5b/,Discussion üó£,jdrukis,xrgxtk,/r/amcstock/comments/xrgxtk/read_then_speak_i_ortex_guy_want_to_see_all_5b/,https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/xrgxtk/read_then_speak_i_ortex_guy_want_to_see_all_5b/,0,2022-09-29

APYP: Could this Stock Make You AppYea? $APYP,"AppYea (APYP) is a digital health company producing sensor monitoring and software solutions for snoring and sleep apnea. The company recently merged SleepX into AppYea by late December 2021. It was a very strategic merge as SleepX held a significant patent portfolio in the field. The company shared much important news which will consolidate the APYP‚Äôs legitimacy and augment its sales. Over the next five years, the company aims to establish its technology and related products as the gold standard for the targeted sectors.

**The Sleep-tech industry is picking up steam**

The Sleep Tech device market is a silent multi-billion dollar worth company. Indeed, in the modern era, almost every study about sleep proves many human beings have sleeping disorders, and technology has helped solve these sleeping issues. As an example, it is estimated that around 75% of adult US citizens experience sleep disorders at least a few nights per week. If the sleep tech devices market was worth less than $15B in 2021 with 19% of market share in the Asia Pacific only, it is expected to grow dramatically to more than $67B by 2030 with an astonishing Compound Annual Growth Rate of 18.1%. If we focus more on APYP segments, the global anti-snoring treatment market is expected to grow to USD 8.6B by 2028, at a strong 9.07% CAGR, and the global sleep apnea devices market is expected to expand at a 6.2% CAGR to reach USD 6.1B by 2028.

## APYP Overview

The company‚Äôs solutions are based on its proprietary IP portfolio of AI and sensing technologies for tracking, analyzing, and diagnosing vital signs and other physical parameters during sleep time, offering extreme accuracy and resistance at an affordable cost. AppYea acquired SLeepX in late December 2021. SleepX was founded in 2019. On August 2, 2021, the company entered into a stock exchange agreement with SleepX Ltd., a company formed under the laws of the State of Israel (‚ÄúSleepX‚Äù) and controlled by the majority shareholder of AppYea; according to the agreement, the outstanding equity capital consisting of¬†1,724¬†common shares of¬†SleepX was exchanged for¬†174,595,634¬†shares of common stock of the company, based on the deal that determined that to SleepX shareholders will be issued common shares in the amount that will result in them holding 80% of the common shares issued of AppYea.

&gt;*‚ÄúI am delighted that we have completed the acquisition of SleepX. The company develops a wearable technology solution to treat snoring and sleep apnea, which is patent protected in the US, EU, and Israel, and caters to two growing markets in high demand.‚Äù*  
*Boris (Bary) Molchadsky, AppYea‚Äôs Chairman.*

One of APYP‚Äôs products, the DreamIT, is a biofeedback snoring treatment wristband. This wristband uses unique algorithms designed by SleepX and sensors to monitor physiological parameters during sleep. Based on real-time reactions, the wristband will vibrate when necessary to decrease the snoring and regulate breathing by gently bringing the user to lighter sleep, thus ceasing the snoring event.

AppYea planned to debut the marketing of the SLeepX app and the first DreamIT product in the fourth quarter of 2022. In parallel, the company plans to undergo an FDA process for SleepX PRO to diagnose non-contact sleep apnea and DreamIT PRO to treat sleep apnea.

## Important News

**May 31**: **SleepX, a subsidiary of AppYea (OTC: APYP)**¬†focusing on the development of accurate wearable monitoring solutions to treat sleep apnea and snoring, announces it received approval from the Helsinki Committee to begin its planned clinical trial on the SleepX PRO application. This follows the company‚Äôs recent update that it intends to test the SleepX Pro application at a hospital sleep lab. The trial is the first step toward applying for FDA approval under the first-of-its-kind medical device category for contactless sleep apnea detection to be performed through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis of breathing during sleep.

## A Development Through 3 Main Axes

**Develop and expand a balanced and diverse pipeline of products and product candidates.** The company‚Äôs core platform technologies will include innovative anti-snoring and sleep apnea-related devices and product candidates in various development and clinical stages. AppYea aims to provide a broad range of products, reducing the risk of dependence on just one specific product.

**Maintain a global, diverse network of specialists to accelerate knowledge synergies and innovation.** The company will use a worldwide network of specialists to identify large and growing patient populations with significant unmet needs. It will enable the company to evaluate and prioritize potential technologies to target new potential users and dive into new market segments. It will also help the company maximize knowledge and reduce its cost synergies.

**Establish distribution channels to maximize the commercial potential of APYP products**. AppYea plans to look for a collaborative arrangement with major healthcare providers and consumer specialists to facilitate market adoption of the company‚Äôs product candidates. If the company manages well to encounter significant partnerships, AppYea‚Äôs market opportunities will become exponential. AppYea targets developing and proving an economic model beneficial to all the possible significant partners. In parallel, the company engages with private insurance plans to build reimbursement programs encouraging using its APYP‚Äôs product candidates.

## Bottom Line

We all know how fast tech companies can grow in the healthcare sector. The company even got approval from the Helsinki Committee and will apply for FDA approval. With more recognized sleeping disorders, experts and future users will eye for new solutions.

"So Nintendo's stock goes -90%, what is happening? A simple financial explanation.","What is called a ""stock split"" is taking place these days.

[https://imgur.com/a/h6LdZZA](https://imgur.com/a/h6LdZZA)

The value of the single share had reached very high levels (as you can read, about 60 000 yen, 426 ‚Ç¨), this reduces the number of potential investors and the number of shares traded (called ""volume""). 

\[By the way, today dollars and euros are worth nearly the same.\]

In addition, Nintendo has imposed a minimum package of shares of 100 for buying and selling (in Japan), which means that if someone wanted to start investing in Nintendo, they would have to have more than 40 000 ‚Ç¨ on hand.

The stock split is 10 to 1, which means that each share has been divided into 10, each 1/10th of the initial value. Those who owned 10 shares now own 100, but with the total economic value unchanged.

For 3-4 years there were requests from shareholders to carry out the split, and I am glad it finally happened. 

I admit that I also asked Nintendo, through the only official channel available, for such a split. In those cases I imagine the underpaid employee of Nintendo Italy, who usually has to respond to emails like ""The console is asking me to update it, is it dangerous?"" receiving one of mine and wondering what the hell I've been smoking.

In conclusion, now a single share costs 42‚Ç¨. Expect a small drop tomorrow, however, because September 30 is the ex-dividend date (i.e. Nintendo gives some money to those who have their own shares), and on that day shares usually drop by the value of the dividend paid.

(Allow me to digress. At the end of March this year it was announced that Zelda's release would be postponed until next year. Nearly every gaming news outlet wrote that such a postponement caused Nintendo's stock market to drop. No dear, a little bit such postponement contributed, but that very day was the ex-dividend).

Thank you for your attention.
