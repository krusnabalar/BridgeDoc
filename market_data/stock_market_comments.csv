# Trading Thesis

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Someone knows something that I don't know. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.",iplihw5,t3_xlxrfp,/r/u_hardyrekshin/comments/xlxrfp/derivatives_dollars_and_degeneracy_20220923/iplihw5/,2,u_hardyrekshin,True,0,2022-09-23

cipheron,"r/jdrouskirsh has the right answer there. She's probably seeing she lost $17K from the stock market peak, not since Joe Biden came to office.

Be careful of financial planners, ""financial planner"" has no more actual legal meaning that calling yourself a ""lifestyle guru"" does. They're not legally obligated to tell you the truth or give you good advice, so they can perfectly well funnel all your money away into things that just enrich themselves. ""certified financial planners"" do a course and get certification, but even that doesn't mean a whole lot. They can still legally recommend you investments based on enriching themselves at your expense.

The gold standard is actually a fiduciary

These professionals have pledged to make recommendations with your best interest in mind, rather than their own financial benefit. They also disclose any potential conflicts of interest as they advise you on potential investments you may wish to make.

So you can ask any financial planner if they're working under a fiduciary duty. Get it in writing, check their credentials.

anthonymarcha,"Okay here’s the legit answer. You’re betting on as high risk as it gets in the stonk market. A biotech company in the early testing stages. No revenue, all cash burning, and pure speculation and hype. On top of it all we’re in an overall bear market/recession where these types of stocks get hit the hardest. My goal which i fucked up already but we still have plenty of time is to catch one more big pump move on hype either due to success with one of their trials or overall sector news related to the mental health crisis and using these drugs as treatment which there’s no doubt in my mind will be helping many more lives as the years go on. Will this company be the next tesla for mental health (Fuck you JR)..  Probably not i don’t bet on those odds but nothing wrong with believing it to be long term. To really increase your chances of success i suggest you learn basic TA skills so that you never buy into hype when a stock is being pumped and getting super over extended on the buying side then you’re left holding a heavy bag.

Regular-Ad1814,"The one thing your analysis misses is how bad the housing crisis is in this country.

Interest rates will limit people's affordability and willingness to take out large mortgages, this is true.

Even at a time of bumper house prices there is not enough housing stock. When rates get worse and people are less likely to want to take on bigger mortgages unless absolutely necessary this will reduce the number of houses going on the market.
A reduced housing stock will sustain prices.

House prices will only fall when demand/supply changes significantly.
In theory if rates rise to above 7% this could see people being forced to sell as they simply cannot afford the mortgage creating a surplus in supply and a drop in prices.
That being said, in this scenario rent prices would also be increasing so it would be more than likely those struggling to afford their mortgage would switch to interest only mortgages for a period of time to ride out inflation.",ipkslu1,t3_xlrypy,/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/xlrypy/house_prices_vs_interest_rates/ipkslu1/,1,UKPersonalFinance,False,0,2022-09-23

Hedge funds take aim at UK fund management groups Citadel and Point72 among firms betting against companies including Abrdn and Ashmore Short interest in Abrdn has risen from 1.7% at the start of the year to 7.1%, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence - Laurence Fletcher and Joshua Oliver in London SEPTEMBER 20 2022

Hedge funds are betting that a tumble in shares of UK asset management companies including Abrdn and Ashmore will accelerate as a brutal bear market dents their investment performance and ability to attract new business. Ken Griffin’s Citadel, Steve Cohen’s Point72 and Marshall Wace are among those running bets on lower share prices for listed so-called long-only firms, whose bias towards rising asset prices puts them at more acute risk from the tumult so far in 2022 in equities and bond markets. Investment house Abrdn, emerging markets fund group Ashmore and investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown are among listed firms where hedge funds have increased their negative bets this year. “The bearish environment [has] . . . pushed hedge funds to ramp up big shorts against listed long-only asset managers that are likely to struggle,” said Ivan Ćosović, founder of data group Breakout Point, which analyses short sales. The bets come during a tough year for global markets as central banks tighten the ultra-loose monetary policy of recent years in an effort to tackle soaring inflation. US equities entered bear market territory this summer, driven by falls in growth stocks, while developed market bonds have weakened sharply. Fund firms whose products are largely geared to rising rather than falling asset prices are already feeling the pain. Last month Abrdn, whose shares are down 40 per cent this year, posted a first-half loss of £320mn, while in July Ashmore, down 23 per cent this year, reported a $14.3bn fall in assets. Hargreaves Lansdown, which last year enjoyed record trading, has reported a fall in profits and new business flows, while its chief executive has warned of “a tough time over the next few months”. Shorting fund firms “is essentially a play on US bond yields. If they continue to rise, that lowers [the] valuation of all other assets including equities,” said Florian Kronawitter, a former hedge fund manager who now writes analysis. “Lower equity prices [means] less fee income for asset managers.” Odey Asset Management, founded by high-profile trader Crispin Odey, is shorting 1.4 per cent of Ashmore. Fund manager James Hanbury wrote in investor documentation seen by the Financial Times that the firm was among several fund firms that were “mispriced cyclical risk”. Citadel, Wellington Management Company, Eleva Capital and JPMorgan Asset Management are also running bets against Ashmore, according to Breakout Point and regulatory filings. Short interest has risen to 9.1 per cent as of early September from 2.9 per cent this year, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Short interest in Abrdn, meanwhile, has risen from 1.7 per cent at the start of the year to 7.1 per cent, close to its highest level this year, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. BlackRock, GLG, Point72 and Citadel are among hedge funds running bets against the firm, according to Breakout Point and regulatory filings. “The earnings power of the business remains highly vulnerable to macro/markets given weak profitability,” wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Bruce Hamilton in a recent note. Analyst expectations for Abrdn are running at close to their lowest on record, according to data group Dystematic and FactSet. Recommended LexFund management UK asset managers: hedge funds profit from the misfortunes of peers Premium content BlackRock and Marshall Wace are among funds targeting Hargreaves Lansdown. That pits them against Nick Train, one of the UK’s best-known stock pickers, whose firm Lindsell Train is the largest outside shareholder in the funds supermarket. Hargreaves Lansdown shares have plunged 37 per cent so far this year. Some investors attribute part of the fall to the broader market turning against growth stocks. But other analysts see specific issues ahead for the company, which will limit its growth. “There’s a fairly broad church of people who think that such high growth will be difficult for Hargreaves Lansdown to sustain in future,” said Julian Roberts, analyst at Jefferies. Short interest, which has been high for some time, has climbed from 8.5 per cent at the start of the year to 10 per cent in early September. The share price took a turn for the worse after chief executive Chris Hill laid out a new strategy, which will boost investment in the business and cut the amount of capital returned to shareholders. “Some people thought that was a recognition of past under-investment and that there was a real headwind for the business. That I think has given people confidence to short this thing,” Roberts said. Longstanding shareholders are unfazed by bets against the company. “We don’t take into account short sellers or not. You’ve got to form your own view and back it,” said Julian Fosh, co-manager of the UK Growth Fund at Liontrust, a top 10 shareholder. “We see a very strong platform. We see very loyal customers. There’s lots of chit-chat about short-term issues, having to invest a bit more, but nothing to damage their competitive advantage,” he said.",ipks5y0,t3_xlsa5y,/r/Superstonk/comments/xlsa5y/ken_and_stevie_trying_to_take_down_hargreaves/ipks5y0/,1,Superstonk,True,0,2022-09-23

I'm not talking about a command economy.  Market socialism would use markets to determine supply and demand the same way a capitalist system does, but would remove the distortions caused by the capitalists by replacing them with a system of social ownership.

There are a lot of potential ways to handle this, such as Roemer's coupon socialism where everyone has a share in the stock market or Schweickart's economic democracy that structures the economy around worker co-ops and charges ""rent"" on capital to provide revenue for societal funds, and a host of other potential models.

i_really_wanna_help,"&gt;A Canadian recession model constructed by Oxford Economics shows the country’s economy has crossed a critical threshold indicating a recession is “imminent,” with the firm’s director of Canada economics, Tony Stillo, warning in a report this week a moderate downturn will start in the next quarter and last until the middle of 2023.

&gt;The model, which tracks five macroeconomic and financial indicators, including the spread between the yields on Government of Canada 10-year and three-month debt, Canadian stock prices and energy’s share of the Bank of Canada commodity price index, has predicted four of the past six downturns in Canada.

&gt;The two exceptions, Mr. Stillo says, followed the 2014 collapse in oil prices and the onset of the pandemic in 2020, two episodes triggered entirely by external factors.

&gt;In its forecast Oxford predicts the Canadian economy will shrink 1.8 per cent over three quarters, a slowdown which would be similar in length but shallower than the “typical” Canadian recession over the past 50 years.

&gt;And while Mr. Stillo believes the chance of a recession turning into a deeper financial crisis remains low, he warned heavily indebted Canadian households and the housing market will feel the brunt of the pain.

&gt;As of August, house peices had fallen 16 per cent from their February peak, and Oxford predicts the correction won’t end until prices are down 30 per cent from their peak. That would still leave prices 7 per cent above their prepandemic level, meaning those most at risk are homebuyers who rushed into the market over the past two years.

&gt;Even so, with rising interest rates, high inflation and an unemployment rate that’s predicted to rise to 8 per cent from 5.4 per cent in August, Oxford warns consumers will be squeezed into slashing spending and reining in their debts.",ipjot98,t3_xljj3c,/r/canada/comments/xljj3c/canada_to_face_a_moderate_recession_in_last/ipjot98/,1,canada,True,0,2022-09-23

goodreads-bot,"[**How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7726420-how-to-live-safely-in-a-science-fictional-universe)

^(By: Charles Yu | 233 pages | Published: 2010 | Popular Shelves: science-fiction, sci-fi, fiction, time-travel, scifi)

&gt;A story of a son searching for his father . . . through quantum space–time. 
&gt; 
&gt;Minor Universe 31 is a vast story-space on the outskirts of fiction, where paradox fluctuates like the stock market, lonely sexbots beckon failed protagonists, and time travel is serious business. Every day, people get into time machines and try to do the one thing they should never do: change the past. That’s where Charles Yu, time travel technician—part counselor, part gadget repair man—steps in. He helps save people from themselves. Literally. When he’s not taking client calls or consoling his boss, Phil, who could really use an upgrade, Yu visits his mother (stuck in a one-hour cycle of time, she makes dinner over and over and over) and searches for his father, who invented time travel and then vanished. Accompanied by TAMMY, an operating system with low self-esteem, and Ed, a nonexistent but ontologically valid dog, Yu sets out, and back, and beyond, in order to find the one day where he and his father can meet in memory. He learns that the key may be found in a book he got from his future self. It’s called How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe, and he’s the author. And somewhere inside it is the information that could help him—in fact it may even save his life.

ReThinkingForMyself,"Only one trade will be made at the absolute bottom. One. And someone will be on the selling side of that trade. 

Only a fool will invest all of their investment cash on the same day, or in a single ticker.

If you are itching to do something, set GTC limit orders for just a few shares, at very low prices. This can scratch that itch and catch red days while you're not at the screen. 

Buy a few shares of dividend kings on red days, and set the dividend to DRIP. This way assures that you will be buying more shares, rain or shine. Your goal is to own a lot of shares. When you do own a lot of shares, things will look very different to you. 

If you are not buying risky meme or pump and dump stocks, it's kind of hard to make a buying  mistake. Even if you bought at the peak of the bubble, it just means you will have to wait longer to start turning a profit. If you need the cash now and can't afford to wait then just get out of the stock market, you can't afford to buy stocks yet.",ipjrskv,t3_xl1ba5,/r/stocks/comments/xl1ba5/is_now_time_to_buy_or_wait/ipjrskv/,1,stocks,False,0,2022-09-23

rebeltrillionaire,"I get why. I was tempted even though the monthly woulda gone up by almost $1,000. 

1.9% vs. 3.0% 

15 vs 30

The thing with the 15 is just that… it’s so incredibly palatable.

Let’s say you were thinking about having kids, but you want to wait one more year. Then you try for 6 months before finally getting pregnant. 9 months later you’re a parent.

Your kid will be 13 when your house is paid off.

Now… is it possible to build that kind of wealth in the stock market… in that same time? Possibly more? It’s possible. I’ve honestly rarely heard of it though.

I feel like people are much better at saving when it’s in large chunks too. Going from a big mortgage to a huge savings deposit? You’ll have missed out on compound interest for a decade… but then you might severely make up for it.

Black rock are the largest shareholder for loads of companies. And many hedge funds and investment firms also contribute towards the shareholders of plenty more companies. Buying shares off these funds is not circulating money through the economy. 

Also the stock market is not the ‘economy’. When the stock market does well it does not help the people who generated that wealth of the companies being traded, the workers. It only benefits those with shares, those who already had capital to begin with. 

When it fails, it only ever impacts the workers however as the shareholders and companies then get bailed out by the taxpayer.

And “a stock is not a company and a company is not a stock” is a bagholder cop out. The stock market is a vehicle through which a company is assigned a specific dollar value based on any number of metrics, market sentiment, future performance, faith in the CEO, etc. 

No one ever says “a stock is not a company and a company is not a stock” when the share price of a company is up. It’s a bagholder line that is synonymous with “here’s hoping this company’s promises eventually come through so their value (as I understand it) is accurately reflected by the market.” 

So when smart cities and Vegas are done, we’ll see where the PPS is and where the share count stands. Only a few near-term catalysts out there to help the CEO (who is also the CFO, which is another red flag) try to pump the share price.

Blaz3,"This is right and I'm no scientician or economolologist, but from what I understand, the reason that we're all in on GME, is simply because there's enough momentum behind it that we've caught them in the act with GME and by DRSing, we can use GME as the key example of fraudulent and criminal financial activity on Wall Street. While GameStop has done very well for itself recently, there was a time where it looked shaky and that's when hedgie fucks tried to do what they've been doing to other companies.

But this time, wrinkly apes managed to call their bluff and recruit new apes to buy up GME and cause a short squeeze. We all know the deal, naked shorts, cellar boxing, price manipulation, but this could have happened to any company and it likely happened to popcorn and possibly baby/towel. Behind the scenes, the wall streeters who have had nearly completely autonomous control over America's (and realistically, the world's) financial sector, all of a sudden had one stock that a bunch of dumb retail investors started buying and not selling. But then even when the office pumped higher and higher and they thought ""it's ok they'll tire themselves out, it'll cost us a few bucks, but we'll get back to business and close this one up quick like."" But not this time, no. Apes kept buying and not selling. Then the tricks started happening. MSM FUD, Name calling, price manipulation. Yeah we had a few paper hands, but things weren't working like normal. They weren't selling. Uh oh, they're multiplying! Uuuhhh turn that buy button off. Oh shit uhhh Well, let's drag that one with the headband in front of Congress, that'll scare them off!
But we weren't scared off. We haven't been scared off. We're slowly locking the float and nobody in the MSM will dare even mention the three little letters, DRS. 

GME and the short squeeze could have been almost any company, it just so happened that the one we managed to get were financially savvy, hired the right people, fired the right people and have felt like they're in the trenches with us. They're still running a business and doing what they can to keep up with the time, but their response to the market, their stock situation and shareholders DRSing has been an incredible ride.

understandstock,"What's your definition of ""investment falls""? That the stock price went down or that the business is not performing in line with your previous model/expectations?

If you mean that the stock price has gone way down, this is exactly why you shouldn't buy a stock based on someone else's conviction. I would encourage you to dive deep into [Celanese financials](https://understandstock.com/entities/1306830-celanese-corp) and then it's [SEC filings](https://understandstock.com/entities/1306830-celanese-corp/submissions) (particularly their 10K filings) to understand the business thoroughly.  Based on your understanding, then determine a valuation of the business and then look at whether the current market price is below or above your personal valuation determination. I suspect you'll have a good sense of whether you should keep it at current levels, DCA or take losses at that point.

If you mean that the business is not performing in line with your previous model/expectations, I would look at whether the overall thesis you had has been proven wrong. I am starting to be much more resistant to selling unless it's very clear that the business economics is not going to allow it to win long-term or the management team is untrustworthy (either ethically, business sense wise or in how they'll treat shareholders.)

VZ is the one I'm in, it's at $40 right now... when market recovers it'll go back to $50-60 where it normally is when market isn't crashing, so if you buy in now, you'll make 25-50% gain on the stock price itself, while also making fairly safe (VZ dividend has only increased year over year for the last 9 years, and i don't see that stopping) 6%+ gains from dividends while waiting it out.

jackandjillonthehill,"There is a ""selloff"" when there are more sellers than buyers **at a specific price.** Then the stock must reprice to a lower level where the sellers and buyers are equal. 

This is an important concept because there doesn't need to be **volume** for a price level to move. Prices can gap in either direction, but most commonly gap down. 

In reality, during a ""sell off"", there are NO buyers other than **dealers or market makers. Most other market participants are selling.** The dealers can step in and place bids, but they make these bids low enough that they calculate there are good odds they will be able to offload at a premium later. Because of the **bid-ask spread** these market makers can consistently make money even when they get the price wrong. 

If you want to go deeper on this topic, I'd suggest reading Jack Treynor.

This brings the stock back to compliance but at this point people start sell off and then before you know it stock is back under $1 they can do another reversal or get kicked off to the otc market and depending where you have your stocks you will only be able to sell or hold out to zero.

[From ""Privitization and buisness ties"" found at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Privatization_and_business_ties

""There was also an ideological motivation. Nazi ideology held entrepreneurship in high regard, and ""private property was considered a precondition to developing the creativity of members of the German race in the best interest of the people.""[54] The Nazi leadership believed that ""private property itself provided important incentives to achieve greater cost consciousness, efficiency gains, and technical progress.""[54] Adolf Hitler used Social Darwinist arguments to support this stance, cautioning against ""bureaucratic managing of the economy"" that would preserve the weak and ""represent a burden to the higher ability, industry and value.""[55]

The month after being appointed Chancellor, Hitler made a personal appeal to German business leaders to help fund the Nazi Party for the crucial months that were to follow. He argued that the experience of Weimar Republic had shown that ""'private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of democracy.' Business was founded above all on the principles of personality and individual leadership. Democracy and liberalism led inevitably to Social Democracy and Communism.""[56] In the following weeks, the Nazi Party received contributions from seventeen different business groups, with the largest coming from IG Farben and Deutsche Bank.[57] Many of these businesses continued to support Hitler even during the war and even profited from persecution of the Jews. The most infamous being firms like Krupp, IG Farben, and some large automobile manufacturers.[58] Historian Adam Tooze writes that the leaders of German business were therefore ""willing partners in the destruction of political pluralism in Germany.""[59] In exchange, owners and managers of German businesses were granted unprecedented powers to control their workforce, collective bargaining was abolished and wages were frozen at a relatively low level.[60] Business profits also rose very rapidly, as did corporate investment.[61]

The Nazis granted millions of marks in credits to private businesses.[62] Many businessmen had friendly relations to the Nazis,[58] most notably with Heinrich Himmler and his Freundeskreis der Wirtschaft.[63] Hitler's administration decreed an October 1937 policy that ""dissolved all corporations with a capital under $40,000 and forbade the establishment of new ones with a capital less than $200,000,"" which swiftly effected the collapse of one-fifth of all small corporations.[64] On July 15, 1933 a law was enacted that imposed compulsory membership in cartels, while by 1934 the Third Reich had mandated a reorganization of all companies and trade associations and formed an alliance with the Nazi regime.[64] Nonetheless, the Nazi regime was able to close most of Germany's stock exchanges, reducing them ""from twenty-one to nine in 1935,"" and ""limited the distribution of dividends to 6 percent.""[65] By 1936 Germany decreed laws to completely block foreign stock trades by citizens.[66] These moves showed signs of Antisemitism and a move toward a war economy, with the belief that the stock market was being operated by Jews.""

Byronthebanker,"I don't know if you can search my user name in this r/, because I've spelled all of this out in the past.   Same warning - I'm retired.   Actually retired from being a Banker and Financial Advisor also, but I do remember a lot of it.  Your very specific financial situation should be discussed with your Financial Advisor always.  

After 16 year, you have several retirement accounts at Publix which are handled different. 

1) ESOT - Employee stock ownership trust.   This is all qualified funds (pre-tax) that has several options. 

A. Let it ride.  Leave your stock in your account just as it is.  Continue to collect or re-invest dividends as before.  

B. Cash it out.   Will be taxed as regular income the year you cash it out, and if you are under age 59 1/2, you will owe a 10% tax penalty

C. Roll it over in kind to an IRA at a brokerage firm (Yes, even though it doesn't trade on the open market, Publix stock does have a stock symbol and can be held in outside accounts.  It can only be bought and sold through the stock office though.)  This option is a lot like option A, but there are some advantages to having it in an IRA.  Not a taxable event

D. Sell the stock and transfer the money to an IRA to reinvest.   Not a taxable event.  You Financial Advisor will help with this. 

E. Pretty much any combination of the above. 

2) 401K - all of the money in this plan is pre-tax also.  Also, your company's specific plan may have its own rules not discussed here.  The retirement office can help you. 

A. Your plan may have an option to allow you to leave the account and they still continue to manage it. 

B You may get another job that allows you to roll over your current 401K plan into theirs

C. You can sell it out and take a check.  (Taxed as income and 10% penalty if under age 59 1/2).  Company will likely withhold 35-40% of the proceeds as taxes, but that could trigger a tax refund situation next April when you file.  

4. Sell it and put the cash into an IRA (non-taxable event).  Note that rolling the current stock from 401k to IRA is not an option - has to transfer as cash per IRS rules.  

5. Sell it and put the money into a ROTH IRA.  You need a financial advisor that understands your specific situation, but if you are in a position to pay the taxes on the funds now while your account balance is likely the lowest it's been in 2022 (stocks closed today low), you can then take the money out in your retirement tax free.  

&amp;#x200B;

Investment Strategy. 

This is going to depend a lot on your age and where you are in your career cycle.  If you're leaving for another job, you won't need this money as income right now.  I believe in having core holdings in American Equities.   That is ownership in American Companies to be the largest part of a growth portfolio.   This can be further diversified into sectors, and also small, medium, and large companies (Called small cap, mid cap, and large cap).  Also I am a strong believer in companies that have a solid history of giving dividends - sharing their profits with stock holders.   

Which companies to buy?  I don't know.  That's why I further believe in mutual funds, but now prefer exchange traded funds.   These are both ways to buy multiple companies with just one purchase / trade.    

I will use stock symbol PEY as an example.  When you buy 1 share of PEY - which is the Invesco High Yield Dividend Achievers, you get exposure to the approx. 50 stocks inside the fund, and there is a professional fund manager whose job it is to manage the $1.3BB (Billion) in that fund.  

Hope this helps.  Bottom line, find a financial advisor, and by that I mean one that works with a reputable broker dealer (Wells Fargo Advisors, Edward Jones, Raymond James, etc..)  They will employ advisors that are fiduciaries and can only work in our best interest.  They will also have a highly regulated license to be able to sell financial service products to the public.",ipo9uww,t3_xmbb3j,/r/publix/comments/xmbb3j/stock_and_401k_money/ipo9uww/,1,publix,False,0,2022-09-24

consultinglove,"Even if it was true that I gave 75% opinion and 25% statistic, which it isn’t, that’s still more facts than you have given. Isn’t that sad?

My facts literally prove companies can’t afford to advertise as much as they did before, so your opinion that we will see nothing except crypto ads and that “Reddit” will make bank is factually wrong. I guess you were too dumb to understand that.

Thanks for admitting I gave facts though, that’s more than you can admit for yourself. Feel free to review the dumb opinions you’ve given and the facts I’ve used to prove you wrong. Because at the end of the day you have done nothing but give dumb opinions easily proven wrong by facts:

Your dumb opinion #1:

&gt;Your literally making absolutely sure we are all going to have to wade through a sea of crypto adds while Reddit makes bank

My facts that proves you wrong:

&gt;Disagree, NFTs have been collapsing already as well as advertisements. Coinbase stock is down 75%, Opensea volume is down 90%. NFT business and need for advertisements are dying by themselves.

Your dumb opinion #2:

&gt;These companies are absolutely NOTHING BUT ADVERTISING

My facts that prove you wrong:

&gt;How dumb do you have to be to think that companies like Coinbase, with a market cap of 14 billion dollars and thousands of employees, only have marketing people.

Your dumb opinion #3:

&gt;Crypto companies on the edge cut everything in order to keep advertising

My facts that prove you wrong:

&gt;You think a company that lost 75-90% of their business is able to advertise more? You don’t seem to understand how businesses work or budgets for marketing. Advertisements are always a fraction of revenue. Guess what happens when revenue plummets?",ipottbf,t3_xllk44,/r/Buttcoin/comments/xllk44/how_i_got_a_fuglyass_nft_i_cant_believe_people/ipottbf/,1,Buttcoin,True,0,2022-09-24

marketrent,"The Bank of England warned the new chancellor of the Exchequer, Kwasi Kwarteng, that the economy is in recession and this package may trigger more rate rises. And yet.

Key passages from the linked piece in *The New York Times*:

&gt;Prime Minister Liz Truss of Britain on Friday gambled that a hefty dose of tax cuts, deregulation and free-market economics could reignite growth before the next general election as her government unveiled a package of measures that is likely to determine its electoral success or failure.

&gt;Mr. Kwarteng abandoned a proposed rise in corporate taxation and, in a surprise move, abolished the top rate of 45 percent of income tax applied to those earning more than 150,000 pounds, or about $169,000, a year. He also cut the basic rate for lower earners.

&gt;The government is betting that reducing taxes will encourage more investment and that the benefits will flow through the economy. But the risk is that the measures are insufficient to reverse years of lackluster productivity and business investment.

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The combination of tax cuts and promises already made to shield households and businesses from the soaring cost of energy will mean more government borrowing, and one of the biggest dangers is that investors shun the plans. That would push the cost of borrowing to painful highs that make the debt levels unsustainable.

&gt;On Friday, British asset prices dropped steeply. The pound has weakened against most major currencies, and reached its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since 1985, falling 1.7 percent to below $1.11. The FTSE 100, Britain’s benchmark stock index, lost nearly 2 percent.",ipnv8bc,t3_xmd7ah,/r/Economics/comments/xmd7ah/uk_government_goes_full_tilt_on_tax_cuts_and/ipnv8bc/,1,Economics,False,0,2022-09-24

anlskjdfiajelf,"If you're interested you can look into gaming NFTs. I know NFTs isn't exactly convincing on their own lmfao, I have self awareness I promise, but being able to trade my in game items for actual cash sounds like genuine utility to me. Steam doesn't let me trade for cash, only cash in my steam wallet to buy more games with. I don't have liquidity in my online card games, it's just a black hole sink of money. At least with physical trading cards, I own and can sell those. Can't sell online mtg cards, hearthstone, etc. There's a bunch of NFT trading card games to bring the trading back into the genre. 

You can buy an NFT of a song (Nas sold 2 songs) and it actually gives you yield based on Spotify, apple music, tidal, and YouTube music streams. So to me it's actual ownership, it's not just some silly token. It's an NFT that actually generates yield for those songs. 

There's an NFT on GameStop's marketplace of a TV show. They tried to get it on Netflix but it's a whole process. Being able to make their content out of their pocket and monetize themselves on their own terms I think is great for the producers and consumers. 

Bitcoin I find useful as a long term volatile store of value. Bit of an oxymoron I'll admit, but the way I see it it's been 12 years and BTC ain't going anywhere. It's the same investment vehicle as gold, it's a rare asset people clearly are willing to pay for. It's a failed currency, but a successful asset to own and hold like any other traditional asset. 

I think defi is the most compelling use case. Our traditional markets have little transparency. Naked shorting happens all the time, PFOF is a scam, FTDs are absurd. Defi solves this genuine problem. The blockchain is transparent and nothing can be hidden. 

I think with our current broken market structure, and I think we can all agree it's broken, I believe defi does solve a genuine problem. 

I can keep going right, I clearly believe there is genuine utility here so I'm putting my money where my mouth is. 

There are loads of use cases you just have to think about it. 

Once again defi is the most compelling to me. In the traditional market only multi billion dollar companies can be a market maker, which is to say they're the house and are providing liquidity and taking a fee for their service. Currently we're all blocked from getting in on that action, but in defi I'm currently liquidity providing and I've been getting good yield off it. 

I think it's a much more fair and honest system that allows anyone to truly participate in the market regardless of how much cash they have. The rewards scale linearly, you don't get more % yield for putting down more money. 


I get it's one of those things that people are just very stuck in their opinion, me too obviously, but the times have changed and there is a shit ton of utility that isn't just btc and even eth these days. 

Defi, gaming NFTs, music NFTs, art NFTs (not generative monkey pictures to be clear, that shit is dumb as fuck and most are straight up scams), btc, decentralized identification chains, supply chain blockchains, and a slew more I think all provide genuine utility and transparency that we don't have in our current broken corrupt system. 


The blockchain allows for an equal transparent playing field, our stock market does none of that. Funds break the laws all the time, FINRA fines are public, and the cost they pay is pennies to their profit. Doing crime is just the cost of doing business for them.

Archegos used security-based swaps to gain exposure to these securities while concealing the true size of the fund’s positions from the market and our trading counterparties. Once Archegos gained market power in these securities, I and others used this power to trade in such a way as to artificially manipulate the prices of the securities. Acting at the direction of the head of the fund [Hwang], I traded to increase the prices of names in which Archegos held long positions and reduced the prices of securities in which the fund hel[d] short positions. I did this by, for example, buying large amounts of a stock when the price dropped in response to negative news or trading premarket when I knew the fund’s activity would have a greater impact on price.

grokmachine,"Why put so many words in my mouth that I didn't say? I never said it was priced just right. I do expect a bit more short-term drop, maybe 5-10%, before an upward trajectory can take over again. I just said the market wasn't expensive at this point relative to the last 30 years. 

You're throwing a lot of things together, some of which are short term factors, some long term, and for some you're looking in the rear-view mirror and what you say isn't a good guide any more. 

For example, inflation going forward is far lower than 8%. There are some lag effects in measurement, particularly housing, that make it seem higher than it is. Powell is making the same mistake you are in using a laggy YoY number, and may well send the economy (deeper) into recession pointlessly with further rate increases. I think we get a small additional drop as the market prices in one more .75 percent raise from the Fed. Anything beyond that would be worse. Even with a .5% increase I would expect a rally. So yeah, I think Powell could fuck it up and create both a recession and a deep bear market like you predict. But it is far from inevitable. It would be a human mistake by someone trying too hard to imitate Paul Volcker.

Some of the other things, like EPS contraction, are short term issues. Higher cost of debt is a long term factor, but we are in historically normal ranges right now. We're only shocked by the current rates because we've been in an extremely easy money environment since 2009. But most of the shock of that change has already happened.

And thanks for the ad hominem, but the last financial statement I looked at was about a week ago.

CremedelaSmegma,"Pretty much.  You invest in gold equities, which are volatile and you have to know the companies much more than just blindly investing in large cap tech.

You buy gold for other reasons.  A 5% diversification is usually the rule of thumb (total precious metals).

Just don’t buy them at market tops.  Do it when everybody hates it.  Calling it dead.  It isn’t, just like oil wasn’t dead, or we had hit “peak oil” when it was trading negative.

There is probably a cycle low coming up in the next year.  Good time to grab a couple.  But don’t look at it is an investment like one would a stock.

potatosquire,"&gt;Let’s take this in context of wallstreet running rampant with no consequences  


What does that have to do with CINE exactly? It's a company that's nearing bankruptcy due to shrinking revenues and a high debt burden, wall street has nothing to do with it. 

&gt;greatest trick was to make you sell before you get the money you earned by putting your money for business and economy which they borrowed transferring left right and centre people just don’t notice till you take a deeper dive  


Would you mind translating this into English?

&gt;I predict recession to last another 2 years If you all sell now this company can’t make it

Holding onto shares to prop up a stocks price will only help the company to survive if this allows them to do a dilution to help manage their balance sheet. The company currently has 40m market cap and 9b in debt. There is no amount of dilution that the company could do at this price, or any price anywhere close to its current one, that would make the slightest dent in their debt burden. Whether people like the stock or not at the current price is completely irrelevant to whether they'll survive or not. 

&gt;But if it makes it your a millionaire or have enough to buy a freaking house straight off the bat

So your investment thesis is simply that you'll be rich if the price goes up? No particular reason beyond that? Great.

dWintermut3,"how would that even work?  most wealth of those individuals is in their stock in their own company, would people be forbidden from paying more than a certain price for stocks so the value didn't rise?  if the value of Amazon stock was at 100 and if it went up the majority holder would be worth more than a billion would I be told I can't put in a buy order at all because it would be for $101?

that would obviously cripple both the stock market and with it the economy.

or would you force people to give up their business? when the price hit a billion dollar market cap would they have to sell off until eventually they didn't own the company anymore?  what if someone didn't want to give up legal control of the business they founded?  for that matter many times a business suffers badly when the founder and person who really understands the business quits (look at Apple having to try to get Jobs back out of retirement after he left for NeXT, because it was being run into the ground).  I'm quite sure the people laid off because the business was tanking under new management will be very glad their owner was forced to sell so he didn't get too rich.

and then there's the practical matter.  if I have a business that is growing and I think could be a billion-dollar business, why would I bother to grow if I'd lose the company? either I'd stop at a comfortable level (and thus not create more jobs and more valuable products) or I would focus on international expansion and make my wealth in a country that wouldn't take literally all of it from me.

Diazjones23,"i’m reading this book at the moment! i’ll give you some thoughts from what i’ve read so far and use email marketing as an example. 

1. Reciprocity - put together an easy but valuable PDF of say a guide or some tips and tricks that have to do with your product or industry. Send this out as a ‘free gift’ to your list. After a few days or so send another email to everyone that downloads the PDF, asking for a purchase or showing your bestsellers. They’ll be more inclined to return the favour by making a purchase. 

2. Social proof - this one’s a bit simpler. you can send out an email that has 3-5 reviews of the product. Works even better if you can showcase pictures of people that are exactly like the target market for more relatability. Could also put a case study in an email to use for social proof. 

3. Authority - sort of like the social proof email, send an email highlighting any press releases or if you were featured anywhere. For example, some products have been featured in well known magazines. Feature this and showcase that people of authority trust and like your product. 

4. scarcity - you don’t want to promote false scarcity as you want to keep that relationship and trust with the customer base. but say a certain items running low on stock.. send an email out telling the customer that, and that you’re helping them by giving them a heads up. “you don’t know exactly when this items going to be back, so if it’s your favourite stock up now just in case”

5. Liking - works best if you’ve got some influencers that work with you or some endorsements. here you can send an email out with that person talking about how they use it, how it benefits them, etc. if it’s someone your target market “likes” then they’ll be more inclined to trust their thoughts and purchase.  

These can all work together to. You could get all of these elements say in a welcome series to warm the customer up. Or you could make sure your monthly campaigns include all or most of these elements.

Versace__01,"Your post really belongs on r/personalfinance. 

But since you are here already here is my opinion. I am assuming the $1,500,000 is before taxes are taken out. So after federal/state taxes you are looking at probably keeping $1,140,000 (or close to that). I would like to introduce you to dividend investing. You get paid a dividend every 3 months (or what we call a quarter in the stock market). Stick $600,000 of that $1,140,000 into high dividend ETFs. My personal favorite is Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (ticker symbol = SCHD). 

As for the remaining $540,000. This will be for 50% saving and 50% spending. So stick $270,000 in the bank savings account. The other $270,000 is for a new vehicle, a few vacations, and yes my friend you can now get the $4,000 a month rental you want easily. 

Just for perspective for SCHD alone you can buy approx. 8,820 shares for approx. $68 right now with that $600,000. Your annual dividend income will come out to approx. $21,400. So then divide that by 4 quarters = $5,350 per quarter.

BikingViking0482,"Late to the party here, but I'm actually surprised you're finding Indians to be cheaper than Harleys, since on average around me I'm seeing Indians at the same price as Harleys or a bit higher. Either way, less expensive is nice.

As for a lot of Indians being liquid cooled, you aren't wrong. The entire Scout and Scout Sixty lineups as well as the Challengers and Pursuits are all fully liquid cooled. Anything Thunder Stroke is air cooled, so Chiefs, Chieftains, and Roadmasters. But if you're aiming to keep costs down and are looking at Scouts, yep, 100% all liquid cooled. Harley does have the new liquid cooled Sportster and Pan-America out, but otherwise the closest they come is the partial liquid cooling on the full deckers.

Pros? You're going to be turning heads everywhere you go. Harleys are a dime a dozen, but Indians just have that distinctive look to them and there still aren't a lot of them on the road in comparison. (We're around typical Japanese cruiser market penetration, I think. Maybe a bit higher since people like the fact that it's American competition for Harley.) From what experience I have on mine so far, they're solid, reliable bikes with gobs of power on tap that can be ridden gently and sanely or can also be ridden like you've got a psychotic demon locked up inside the motor desperately trying to get out. They look, feel, and sound fantastic and are balanced like the Victory motorcycles were with all the weight down low. They honestly ride like a dream. (Plus we tend to get better stock suspension than Harleys.) The cast aluminum frames on the liquid cooled bikes are also solid as hell and keep everything from twisting and getting squirrelly on you.

Cons? The dealer network is nowhere near the level of Harley or the Japanese brands. (At least in Canada, anyway. The States may be a different story.) It does seem like Polaris is actively working on adding to its Indian dealer network, which is good. Parts are going to cost you if you want to change bits and bobs and use Indian parts, and the aftermarket support isn't as extensive as (again, I know,) Harley, etc. That being said, when I put the adaptive Pathfinder headlight on my Pursuit, the aftermarket options were only $100-$200 cheaper at most. Stock seats are serviceable, but can be improved. This is one area where I have to admit that Harley does still tend to reign supreme, at least with their touring bikes.

As for my model preference, well, riding a Pursuit kind of gives it away. I love long distance rides and wanted a bike built for that. I sat on a few Scouts back when I still had my 900 Vulcan and was looking to upgrade for more power, but it was physically too small of a bike for me and my riding preferences at 6'2"" and a solid 210-ish pounds. I also wasn't thrilled with the small gas tank for long rides and ultimately kept the Vulcan a bit longer until I pulled the trigger on the Pursuit.

Service work cost has so far been about what you'd expect out of any motorcycle, especially a premium brand. If you do it yourself it's obviously going to be cheaper, but taking it to a shop has usually never been cheaper than $300CAD for me for the break-in service and the 1st service as well. Oil changes are much, much easier on Indian than Harley, since we have one shared oil pan as opposed to Harleys having two or three drain plugs for different oils depending on whether it's an Evolution (883 or 1200) or Twin Cam/Milwaukee Eight motor. I'm not sure about the new 1250 Sporties with the liquid cooled motor; Harley might have smartened up there. You may hate the air filter, though, if you change it yourself. All the liquid cooled Indians bury it under the gas tank instead of putting it on the side of the engine like the air cooled ones. I haven't had to change mine yet, but from what I understand you have to fully remove the gas tank to access the air filter. The upside is that it gives you lots of knee clearance since you don't have an air filter poking out the side of the bike.",ippi11q,t3_xijwnl,/r/IndianMotorcycle/comments/xijwnl/looking_into_buying_an_indian_motorcycle/ippi11q/,1,IndianMotorcycle,False,0,2022-09-24

Then one day (a stream I hadn’t watched because I was already falling off the whole bear train) he accidentally showed his emails for just a few seconds but someone here was watching and was either recording it or took a snapshot of it but he had emails showing that he had the robinhood app and was actively trading…the real kicker was when the stream was uploaded by codd or whoever does it that exact spot where the emails were shown had been blacked out but only the robinhood emails the rest were visible. They were covering up the fact he was using the robinhood app. At that point it was clear he was purposefully trying to hide it because he is a liar, hypocrite and manipulator. He inevitably admitted to it in a later stream but did the whole gamma this attacking me squirt I only had the app so I could understand the beast system better BULLSHIT.

monstimal,"He's not really clear about what the downside is. He says oh no poor workers are losing out...why, because of inflation? No, he says that's not there. I think he is saying impending recession, but it very much seems more like he's just bemoaning a 10% drop in the S&amp;P, which started at the CPI release, not the very much expected Fed rate hike. In fact 0.75 was lower than full point that was priced at 20%. The stock market is dropping because it's insane to think you will get a return from these stock prices. 

The Fed was late. It was crazy to listen to their ""transitory"" stuff in 2021 and many people were saying it at the time. They messed up. And I agree with him that Powell mentions Ukraine way too much, it's an obvious attempt to smooth over their mistake. But here we are now and I do not hear him making a great argument against what they are doing now. There's no reason slowing inflation means it must reverse or continue to slow. There are examples in not so distant past of Fed under responding to inflation and it creating a much bigger problem. Meanwhile these interest rates are not that high historically.

marketrent,"Excerpt from [the linked interview by Shawn Tully](https://fortune.com/2022/09/23/larry-summers-inflation-economy-housing-stock-market-outlook/) in *Fortune*, 23 September 2022:

&gt;Summers never bought the “transitory” argument, that inflation was a passing phenomenon caused by supply-chain bottlenecks and COVID-related shutdowns.

&gt;For Summers, the chief source of today’s heavy inflation is over-the-top demand caused by too much money chasing too few goods. So to throttle a runaway consumer price index, the Fed must keep tightening monetary policy to the point where demand falls—sharply. Just how far does Summers think the Fed needs to go?

&gt;Getting to the answers is a primer in Summers’ view that the heart of economics is arithmetic. He reckons that “underlying inflation,” excluding food and energy, is running at 4% to 4.5%, pretty close to the PCEPI (personal consumption expenditure price index) numbers that guide the Fed. (The PCEPI is calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and widely used by the federal government, including to adjust Social Security payments.)

&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Summers is calling for much higher Fed funds rate, and tighter policies, than investors or the Fed itself are anticipating.

&gt;Rising rates are already pummeling the giant industry most influenced by their fluctuations: housing. 

&gt;According to Ed Pinto, director of the American Enterprise Institute’s Housing Center, at 5% or 5.5%, “it’s likely that by the time we’d get to that number, the economy would already be in recession.” 30-year mortgage rates clocked in at 6.4% on Sept. 20—a collossal jump from just a year ago, and one that has already pushed home sales volumes one-third below 2021 numbers to where they stood in 2015.",ipp6h14,t3_xmnzmz,/r/Economics/comments/xmnzmz/we_spent_the_day_with_larry_summers_the_economist/ipp6h14/,1,Economics,True,0,2022-09-24

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.  
  
On July 27, 2022, American Virtual Cloud Technologies, Inc. (the ""Company"") received a notice in the form of a letter (the ""Notice"") from the listing qualifications department staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market (""Nasdaq"") notifying the Company that for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company's Minimum Value of Listed Securities (""MVLS"") was below the minimum of $35 million required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq listing rule 5550(b)(2).  
  
The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's common stock, and the Company's common stock continues to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ""AVCT.""  
  
In accordance with Nasdaq listing rule 5810(c)(3)(C), the Company has 180 calendar days, or until January 23, 2023, to regain compliance. The Notice states that to regain compliance, the Company's MVLS must close at $35 million or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days (or such longer period of time as the Nasdaq staff may require in some circumstances, but generally not more than 20 consecutive business days) during the compliance period ending January 23, 2023.  
  
If the Company does not regain compliance by January 23, 2023, Nasdaq staff will provide written notice to the Company that its securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal any such delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel.  
  
The Company intends to actively monitor the Company's MVLS between now and January 23, 2023 and may, if appropriate, evaluate available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the MVLS rule. While the Company is exercising diligent efforts to maintain the listing of its common stock on Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain or maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing standards.",ipp7bir,t3_xmofb7,/r/AVCTBulls/comments/xmofb7/delisting_process_whats_the_timeline/ipp7bir/,1,AVCTBulls,True,0,2022-09-24

sleepylemontree,"OP, so sorry for your loss. Wishing you comfort and healing as you move through grief. 

I'll try to be brief but as many have said, I don't think these precognitions prevent the event but rather help you through. I think it's lovely you were able to replace the fresh animated memories over the postmortem visions of him. That was something I struggled with. 

I found my boss (and friend) dead after a heart attack on Dec. 20th. I still grieve for him and that job, I truly enjoyed the job and got it after a few pretty terrible ones. It was a breath of fresh air. I'd say for about 6 months before he died we both had a feeling something ""big"" was coming. We would talk about it. I thought the stock market was going to crash or something, I had no idea. About 4 months before he died he wrote letters to me and his family and told me where I could find them in his desk if something happened. He also confided in me that he had always had the feeling he would die young. He was in his 50s and had health problems and heart issues. In hindsight it's obvious. I think we both ""knew"" I just didn't know I'd be one of the last to see him alive, to find him. In a way it is an honor to be with someone at the end. I too, had the intuition flare. There are few moments that I can recall being at work and time would feel like it stopped and that voice would say ""remember this, appreciate this."" This happened once in the spring. The office looked so lovely surrounded by flowers. I was just so happy to be there in the present moment. I have relied on that memory a lot.",ipp812u,t3_xm2f2l,/r/Paranormal/comments/xm2f2l/precognition_before_my_partners_death/ipp812u/,1,Paranormal,False,0,2022-09-24

aachsoo,"
&gt;then, all other factors being equal, shares of an European company would have a higher price than shares of a comparable US company, since everyone (American, European, or anything else) would expect the exchange rate change to give them a nice extra payoff


Hmm..  but I'm buying MSCI world which contains US and EU stocks. So price raise of EU stocks will also raise the ETF price overall. Or are you saying US company stock value gonna decrease?


Suppose I'm buying X position if I buy non-hedged, and X+5 positions due to currency differences. All things being equal when Euro raises, the hedged (X+5) position gonna make more return than (X) of unhedged. Note that I buy in DCA (ECA? 😆) not a lump sum, if Euro were to continue fall till some point, I get to buy cheaper and cheaper until that point, thus X+n.

&gt;Perhaps 20 years or so?
I dont have crystal ball, but I was hoping EUR-USD would normalize before that and I can rebalance to unhedged. Is it not realistic?

In 10y I dont know if I will DCA monthly like now (vulnerable to currency volatility), or I have flexibility to hold my capital and diversify it to not worry about market condition, but I'm working toward that.


&gt;ones that currently are actually kind of high, because of the difference between interest rates

Can you please explain or paste me the link to the explanation how the difference in interest rate between US and EUR affect  ETF Tracking Difference?


&gt;The natural objection to that is that, even without currency fluctuations, equity is still plenty volatile anyway, and while it makes sense to pay to reduce volatility for instruments that you want to be relatively stable (e.g. bonds) equity's not going to be that anyway.

This is true; but on the other hand, what actually matters is the volatility of one's portfolio *as a whole*, and if one wants to reduce that without reducing their equity exposure then hedged equity funds are IMO a reasonable choice.

Valid point yes, I'd like to decouple the currency volatility to that of equity. Sure equity can be down, but I see little point on adding fewer value to my portfolio just due to (avoidable) currency difference.


&gt;
What is less reasonable, as I see it, is to keep moving from non-hedged funds to hedged funds and vice versa in response to events. This is likely to be much worse than picking one or the other and sticking with it, because once we learn of a situation the market has already reacted to it. 

But the alternative being I DCA fewer, and fewer (excluding the equity value itself) every time while it's pretty clear EUR-USD arent going up anytime soon. Is this reasonable to you?
&gt;But if make that choice, you must be committed to it: if you are instead planning to weave in and out of hedged funds to take *advantage* of currency fluctuations, I think that's not likely to end well.


I would like to understand why, I already see Taxation is factor, and there is hedging cost, no matter how low. I dont know yet if the currency gain is bigger than these given costs above.",ippgm3a,t3_xmc0a8,/r/eupersonalfinance/comments/xmc0a8/how_to_invest_during_weak_eur_high_inflation_and/ippgm3a/,1,eupersonalfinance,True,0,2022-09-24

Shadow-Prophet,"You're the one who's mistaken. UPS has a floor on how cheap their services can get, because they specialize in shipping large packages, whereas the post office can get as cheap as $3 for a small package and down to 60¢ for a letter, a segment of the market UPS has zero interest in catering to. UPS also increases rates significantly for more rural areas, something the USPS explicitly *does not do* because it is their obligation to serve every single person in America equally.

The UPS is a private company with a bunch of trucks and planes for moving stuff around. The post office is a government-owned, taxpayer-funded service that makes mailing and shipping cheap and accessible for everyone.

This would be like you saying the stock market competes with the US dollar. Not only does it work with and heavily rely on the US dollar, but they serve entirely different purposes. Just because they both involve money doesn't mean they're in competition with each other.

And yeah, maybe if I ever lose my job at the UPS Store, I'd try applying for the post office. I'm not opposed to it. But I don't think I have the tolerance for sitting in those delivery trucks in the Texas heat all day.

The key to retiring on a short timeline is saving percentage.  That means keeping spending low really helps.  You are right that you don't need 4 million to retire if you only want to spend $50k/year.

Having a paid off mortgage when you retire is a good idea.

* Central bankers are hellbent on tightening the monetary spigots even if something in financial markets breaks. After haywire cross-asset moves this week, **that tipping point looks dangerously close.**  
* As the S&amp;P 500 plunged another 4.7% over five days, bonds and currencies staged historic gyrations that threaten to **cause fresh havoc** for stock investors already grappling with the lows of this bear market.    
* Treasury yields leaped above levels last seen more than a decade ago, with the speed of the selloff proving **frenetic even by the standards of a manic 2022.**     
* The **dollar soared** to a two-decade high, tightening financial conditions for a slew of borrowers in the developed and emerging world while causing Japan to intervene to support the yen for the first time since 1998.  
* For good measure, UK bonds and the pound sank faster than **any time in the past four decades** -- an in-tandem plunge typically seen in emerging-market trading -- as Britain’s fiscal policy makers unleashed a risky new growth plan.     
* “What we’re seeing is a massive spike in cross-asset volatility and it is leading to a deleveraging or derisking **across all asset classes,**”

Are you ready for a global financial crisis and stock market crash?

No matter how collapse aware we feel we are, the straw that will break the camel's back is likely to be something we are not expecting.  Could be something as unexciting as the Fed raising interest rates to battle inflation...but ending up hurting the rest of the world's economies, there by precipitating collapse.

WorksInIT,"&gt;&gt; I think resistance to immigration in general varies.
&gt;
&gt;Maybe? Yet, has there ever been real evidence based ""resistance""? In the end, it's mostly feelings. 

What do you mean by evidence based? The evidence is pretty obvious for some things like housing. Increased demand and lacking supply leads to increasing prices. 

&gt;&gt;  I really couldn't care less where immigrants come from. I just think the level of immigration should serve our economic needs. Not jut long term, but short term as well. 
&gt;
&gt;What do you mean by that? If we only look at it economically, you would prefer an investment that nets you a couple dollars up front but loses you a lot of money in the end? I think not. You look at investments over the entire length. Why treat immigration different, as long as you claim to see it only economically. 

We aren't talking about investing in the stock market. I say we should consider.the short term impact as well because it can be painful for some typically the lower quintiles when demand outpaces supply. Government policy should consider short term needs and balance thay with long term interests.

&gt;&gt; And then I want it to be legal immigration. Not just legal on paper, but following g the appropriate path for their circumstances.

Private land conservation is a thing. 

In fact, private game hunts in Africa are doing a *much* better job of wildlife preservation. The owner *profits* from having stock to hunt. If he lets poachers kill all of the inventory, he goes out of business. So, part of his expenses are paying for private-hire security to deal with poachers. Another part is to ensure the animals are thriving and population is growing so he can attract more business. The sell is *wild* game hunts, so land and ecosystem preservation is a priority.

Contrast that with the tragedy of the commons, where *politically* motivated spending requires more resources to make war, defend against war, create road-building ""make-work"" projects to feed people that vote for politicians, etc... The plight of White Rhinos is very far down the list of *political* priorities.

Proper_Acanthisitta9,"In the market right now there are only 2 superior options and that's TM and VFC 

TM and VFC have got their shit tougher recently and are releasing some good stuff for example-

VFC: the BCM MCMR, the m733, version 3 of there m4s.

TM: sooooo much stuff, the after market parts are insane. Just to name one big one rn, sp systems with there windows mags and full inners for pretty much cost price as well as the noveske n4 they will release (can you tell I'm a fanboy). as well as TM having an abundance of other platforms not just the ar one.


If I had to pick one I would probably say vfc for the realism and recoil but even with that vfc can have problems (TM too). In cold weather vfc is known to not perform as great. Out of the box with vfc you might get the hop up problem where your BB just rolls out the end or the trigger reset problem ( both can be an easy fix). Oh and real steel parts will fit vfc. 

TM problems can consist of leaking mags that's probably the most common problem as well as nozzle problems where it will snap on u. But the problem are few and far between and don't occur that often. Apart from the problems I listened and maybe the compatibility between stock and 3rd party parts that's pretty much it for TM (at least the problems that I have run into).



_______________________________________________________



Now other gbbr I've used such as ghk, Kwa, we. Il give a quick overview as to why these systems are sub par compared to TM and VFC.

WE- system is old as ass and until the renew the system don't bother getting one. Unless you get it second hand and cheap. Cheep is the only this it has going for it. 

KWA- I had 4 Kwa m4s all brand new and they suck. Hop up is terrible if you lose the key then you can't adjust the hop up. Double feeding constantly and terrible gas efficiency to the point where I can even clear one mag. And the power on those things are crazy my mk16 was shooting 1.9j on .25s and that was a stock gun. I've had ppl argue with me claiming that Kwa is the best coz it's realistic and ""rifles double feed in real life""...... No, your just lieing rs guns don't double feed every 10 rounds. Only this Kwa really has going for it is the recoil and that fact that it's used by LE in the US. Still doesn't make it a good system even upgraded it's still the same.only good things from Kwa are the mp7 and vector. My advice stay away from Kwa with a 10 foot pole. (Just to add I know ppl like Kwa my opinions are my own if you like Kwa then that's cool) 


GHK- ghk is an amazing system and your probably wondering why it's in this subpar section. Well for 2 reasons 1) the hop up ( the stock hop up) the hop ups plastic ass and difficult to access on specific guns.  2) the mags, the mags are good and bad gas efficiency is amazing can shoot 5 loads from a single mag but thoes feed lips break every 2 seconds. I went through a week of training replacing 20 feed lips (no joke). 


_______________________________________________________

To put it into perspective I currently own 

TM- urgi mk16, mk16 but smol, stock M4 cqbr, currently waiting on t8 to finish making the noveske n4 then I will get it hopefully this month, mp7 

VFC- BCM MCMR, m733 converted to look blood diamond car 15, h&amp;k 416.

WE- Scar H, fn m4a1.

&gt;[**Using data on rising rents to predict future inflation**](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2022/beyond-bls/pdf/using-data-on-rising-rents-to-predict-future-inflation.pdf)

&gt;Cody Parkinson

&gt;Both the shelter and housing categories used in the CPI and PCEPI, respectively, include “rent” as a component. Rent measures the price of the current stock of rental units across the United States. Owner’s equivalent rent (OER) is computed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and measures the implicit rent that owner occupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes. The change in rent and OER are highly correlated. Furthermore, rent and OER comprise 32 percent of the CPI market basket but only 15 percent of the PCEPI.

&gt;Rent inflation is highly procyclical. As unemployment falls and economic conditions improve, property owners typically ask for higher rents. After persistent increases in asking rent prices, the average rent of the entire stock of rental units eventually increases. These increases are then captured by the CPI and PCEPI.

&gt;The authors use this information to forecast future rent inflation and future overall inflation. By comparing CPI rent inflation data with Zillow asking rent data from 15 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), the authors find that areas with higher observed asking rents are more likely to have higher rent inflation the following year.

&gt;Using these data to estimate future overall inflation, Lansing and coauthors find that the results imply CPI inflation would have an additional increase of 1.1 percentage points for both 2022 and 2023. And for PCE inflation, they predict an additional increase of 0.5 percentage point for 2022 and 2023.",ips80bm,t3_xn8r5y,/r/Economics/comments/xn8r5y/us_bureau_of_labor_statistics_using_data_on/ips80bm/,1,Economics,True,0,2022-09-25

JakeSaco,"Etrade makes the execution fairly easy.  Simply select: **Sell to Open** in the *""Action""* drop down and then select **Call** in the *'Type'* drop down.  Then pick the expiration date of the option and the strike price you would be willing to sell your shares at.   I would then recommend using a limit order *(somewhere between the bid and ask)* to determine the premium you receive, rather than accepting the market price.

Now only do this if you are truly ready to sell the shares you have and are ok giving up future gains on the stock, while at the same time you don't need the money right away and are ok not getting to sell your shares at the current price.   I mention this because there are too many people out there who lament their decisions because they can't cope with the lost opportunity costs of their shares being sold and missing out on gains as the stock goes up, or not having their shares sell and missing the peak as the stock drops.",ipsv1b0,t3_xn9ecy,/r/options/comments/xn9ecy/covered_calls_on_etrade/ipsv1b0/,1,options,False,0,2022-09-25

OlayErrryDay,"My wife owns a fashion related business and has been in fashion for 20+ years. 

My advice, you don't need a brick and mortar store, sales will likely suck. You wouldn't have time to hunt vintage and stock a store and sell online with just yourself, it's just not possible.

You also reduce your costs greatly by starting out with testing your concept from home and selling online and at places like art festivals, farmers markets, anything that is local and that draws people and costs you virtually nothing.

That allows you to start building a brand locally before you consider wasting your time on a space. Use money to place targeted ads on social platforms that align with your target demographic. That's way more valuable than a store, a lot of people don't even want to go to stores for anything, they just want to sit on their couch and have something sent to them.

90%+ brick and mortar boutiques are owned by rich people that want something to do. I've known at least 10 storefront owners in the space and only one wasn't from a rich family. Almost all of the stores ran at a loss but gave the rich folks some ""cool"" factor that they enjoyed.

Vintage and thrift are a bit of an outlier though and do have the possibility of success due to the low cost of items and high markup. One small chain that I liked is called Buffalo Exchange, they have a similar model and did it right.

You're also going to have a lot of competition; Sure, you have a concept and plan, but how many of these stores exist in your area already? I live in a major metropolitan area and I can think of at least six shops in a ten mile radius. Your concept was fresh about 12 years ago or so; Now, it's played out and competition is strong and with thrift being a legit hobby of tons of young men and women, your ability to find good thrift that you can sell is less and less as the years go by.

If, for some reason you don't have much local completion, you may just be able to do it...but if someone came to me with this plan, including my wife, I'd shake my head and say no way, market is too saturated.

Sorry to be a downer, just wanted to impart my expertise or adjacent expertise on the topic.

I'll also do a breakdown of expenses to help see if any items are missing from your plan 

Insurance - You will need special insurance to have a brick and mortar store in case someone falls etc. You'll likely be required to carry insurance  for the store and the value of the items within the shoe.

Internet if you want it for yourself and customers. If you do that, you'll likely want something like an Eero or two for good guest network abilities and restrictions and good security for you.

Cameras for the store that upload their data to the cloud. This is useful after hours but even more useful if anything happens at the store.

All the various stuff you need for the space...racks, painting, hangers all that fun stuff you probably have on your lease as well as whatever web presence you'd like to l have. For whatever reason, people seem to like even a single page website, not sure why 🤔. Then you need some sort of software to track sales and general inventory and a bunch of other random stuff like local targeted ads on insta...camera and tripod snd backdrop for picture of the clothing.

You just have a lot of expenses with this storefront idea you wouldn't have if you just tried a web platform for a while first. Plus you'd learn a lot about your business without risking a bunch of money.",iptepu8,t3_xn9tnl,/r/smallbusiness/comments/xn9tnl/i_want_to_give_up/iptepu8/,1,smallbusiness,False,0,2022-09-25

Archegos used security-based swaps to gain exposure to these securities while concealing the true size of the fund’s positions from the market and our trading counterparties. Once Archegos gained market power in these securities, I and others used this power to trade in such a way as to artificially manipulate the prices of the securities. Acting at the direction of the head of the fund [Hwang], I traded to increase the prices of names in which Archegos held long positions and reduced the prices of securities in which the fund hel[d] short positions. I did this by, for example, buying large amounts of a stock when the price dropped in response to negative news or trading premarket when I knew the fund’s activity would have a greater impact on price. I manipulated the prices of these securities in order to influence others in the market to buy or sell the securities in ways that would benefit Archegos’[s] key positions and increase Archegos’[s] purchasing power through variation margin” testimonies from Archegos employee whom admitting to 5 felonies with 20 years max each count, totaling possible 100 years sentence.

Th3Trashkin,"I doubt that, it'll probably be easier to hire illustrators for professional works than it is to play ""AI roulette"" with a simple concept and hoping, desperately, whatever comes out is coherent and related to what you wanted. 

Recently, I saw an article in the Atlantic use an AI generated image as a header, it wasn't an article about AI images, but Alex Jones, the funny thing is, this wasn't a sign that the Atlantic would be relying on AI from here on out... all of the articles since (the last I looked) was from a credited illustrator or stock image source.

Because it generally looks like shit, for one, it's unprofessional - people complained about how ugly and slapdash it looked - and for two, it's easier to just tell a human being a specific style, angle, subject, and so on. Unless future ""art AI"" is near human levels of comprehension, or there's a significant amount of creative input to the point that it renders the whole thing moot (I mean, if you're having to fix the image over and over, at what point are you just making the art yourself with the AI generated output?) that ain't happening. 

Secondly, there's a **massive** market for personal commissions, people like supporting artists with specific tastes, styles, and subject matter, there's a sense of prestige from getting work from certain artists. Is art AI able to copy any style ever with perfect comprehension of any niche concept or detail? No. Can you give it feedback, ask for tiny tweaks? No. Is there any value to it among a community? Not unless your community are AI ""art"" nerds.

People will continue to make money making art, maybe in some cases, there will be AI generated images used rather than an artist, but you're making a lot of compromises in doing so. More likely than not, AI art generators will end up mostly being a novelty, while the core concept gets used for something actually profitable and useful. Generated images are already considered annoying spam on many art websites, something that gets deleted for wasting server space (rightly so), rather than respected art.",iptbf8g,t3_xneea9,/r/VaushV/comments/xneea9/feeling_doomer_about_ai_art/iptbf8g/,1,VaushV,False,0,2022-09-25

ReputationCapable170,"60 year veteran my tips: 

Do not panic at the first ""we are in the cone"". Wait a day to so and see how the cone shifts. Also, If you make yourself a hurricane kit and add items in the off season when prices are cheaper you won't need to run to the store and stock up. 

Depending on where you live you might have to spend the storm with friends or family who live in a more inland area. 

I have Hurricane shutters but never put them up until a ""warning"" is in place. I have two sliding glass doors and 3 small windows. All five take me 45 minutes. 

Ask your neighbors if they typically lose power? I live in a condo and one half our our community (mine) does not since we are now underground and on the same grid as police and fire rescue. (4 years after Hurricane Andrew so the items below were purchased the years immediately after: 

Portable wok style stove that can be bought at a Chinese market. Good for boiling water and cooking food. Three 10"" battery powered fans, one each for kitchen bedroom and bathroom and Lantern style battery operated lights. I have since replaced these with LED rechargeable light bulbs that I can put in all of my lamps and will go on as soon as power goes out. All of these items I started with one each but added annually during our tax free days. 

I also bought a rubber maid plastic garbage can to fill up water with to put in the toilet tank so I could flush. Filled fridge and freezer with water bottles as some one already noted. 

A good battery backup is also handy. One that can charge multiple phones tablets etc. I actually have one attached to my router now and haven't needed it. 

If we go into a Hurricane ""watch"" typically 72 hours out...then I buy water. At this point all of the ""cone watchers"" have already bought and the stores typically have restocked. 

Keep in mind that most Publix stores and gas stations now all have full generators and will reopen as soon as the storm has cleared and roads are open. 

Again...don't panic shop at the first we are in the cone, take breath and wait at least a day.",ipu7num,t3_xmzkbp,/r/Miami/comments/xmzkbp/my_first_hurricane_living_in_miami_tipsadvice/ipu7num/,1,Miami,False,0,2022-09-25

Let's not forget the old adage ""follow the money"" -- which leads to, summarily, one place in the here and now: the Wall Street regime and network. 

There's a true **cult**ure problem within and without the United States due to billionaires and Wall Street propaganda and influence. 

The *Wall Street regime/network* is directly tied to:


* national and international destabilization via ""profits over people"" culture and dogma
* propping up and perpetuation of the military industrial complex
* propping up and perpetuation of the prison industrial complex 
* lobbying against healthcare reform 
* manipulation of honest companies 
* fostering and encouraging ignorance of climate change 
* skewed/corrupted banking policy and basic inflation
* outright criminality; i.e. fraud, theft, national and international bribery and lobbying, etc..
  

We will look back on the Wall Street regime and network the same way we do genocidal nations/regimes in 10, 20, 50, 100 years. 

In case it's not obvious to anyone, we're talking about [banal evil](https://philosophybreak.com/articles/hannah-arendt-on-standing-up-to-the-banality-of-evil/) ultimately.

The fed printed a bunch of money and bought assets on the market directly (in addition to mortgage back securities like they did in 2008). This is unprecedented and never happened before. The stock market and the housing market both jumped in response.

kellarman,"Back when it was selling for about $3.50, the bull thesis was that they were not going bankrupt anytime soon and once the new xbox and PlayStation hit the market at the end of 2020, they’ll have a nice bump in sales, making it worth more, and there was an immense amount of short interest (over 100% since people were shorting borrowed shares that have been shorted already). 

The bear thesis was that computer gaming and gaming platforms (like steam) are taking away from console games and GameStop will be obsolete. Also didn’t help them how people can choose to buy these console games on Amazon or in other stores like Target and Walmart.

As we saw, the first point was true. Coupled with Ryan Cohen jumping in out of nowhere and DFV’s weekly updates on wsb gaining traction and rallying wsb to jump in, GME mooned.

I also think the second point is true.

_Deathhound_,"Well downplaying the conspiracy to newcomers could pose somewhat of an issue because MSM has done nothing but try to paint this as a conspiracy for more than a year, and we're talking about the corruption and its influence of the largest financial system/stock market in the world, and the ape vocabulary isn't exactly newcomer friendly, not to mention stock literacy, or the thousands of pages of DD. No one is going to throw their 401K at GameStop by only reading the TLDRs so I hope they enjoy reading.

So try to remember, with anything, and no matter how hard you try, people aren't going to be interested in something unless the motivation comes from within. You can try to encourage them all you want but ultimately it's their decision. All you can do is point them in the right direction and hope they start asking questions.

The most important thing is understanding the who what when where how why so I'd recommend something light and broad at first like the [GameStop - A Long Story Short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGWN1-I8Kac) and the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/wiki/index/faq) to pique their interest. Then get them familiar with the severity of the fuckery by listening to [Patrick Byrne: What is Naked Shorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdBe5_8z53A). And finish it off with the future of Gamestop and the [bull thesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/tw641b/gamestops_bull_thesis_gamestops_history_due/) built on the back of [Immutable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/t6x7ih/gamestops_nft_future_official_update_sneak_peek/).

CatOfTheDecade,"Back in my 20s and 30s I adored living in the city. I could walk to bars, restaurants, farmers markets, mass transit, parks, you name it. Then it came time to buy a house. Ten years ago there was a MASSIVE price disparity between urban and suburban living, with the burbs being far cheaper and offering much better housing stock.

Today I have some restaurants within walking distance. I have a few supermarkets, tons more restaurants, and lots of retail within a 30-minute walk. My municipality is putting in walking trails to connect all the nearby suburban neighborhoods with the commercial districts. It's really nice. We have two major hospitals -- one a magnet with a level one trauma center, one very modern -- and plenty of specialty care. Our first responders and schools are very well funded. 

Before we purchased, I looked at the suburbs as ""the worst of both worlds"". You get the congestion and neighbor proximity of an urban environment, with the ""need to drive everywhere"" isolation of a rural environment. Today I feel the opposite. I think a lot of that was that a flood of people my age moved from urban cores to suburban neighborhoods in the 2010s, and that skyrocketed demand for things we loved about the city -- butcher shops, independent restaurants, unique housing, and so on.

From a preparedness perspective, that puts us on solid long-term financial ground. We have a home we love in an environment we love with easy access to everything we want. If we ever decide to sell, our home's current market value is nearly double what we paid ten years ago.",ipytrc6,t3_xo5rgh,/r/preppers/comments/xo5rgh/what_are_some_negatives_of_living_in_the_suburbs/ipytrc6/,1,preppers,False,0,2022-09-26
The_Scrapper,"AMC's debt is the biggest thing holding the price down right now. The investors and algorithms that determine ""Buy"" and ""Sell"" decisions for a stock see AMC as a company struggling with COVID-era debt. This debt dilutes the impact of future earnings, which is one of the reasons a very strong summer at the box office did not result in a bigger rebound in the stock price. As long as AMC's current debt load remains, it will be hard to turn the general sentiment on wall street toward the positive. The debt is a large part of what feeds the short thesis, and it provides cover for all the shills pushing the ""short and distort"" tactic.

Adam Aron is the CEO of a corporation. His job is to generate long-term profitability for that that corporation. The debt has to go for that to be the case. The sooner, the better, too. AA recognizes that the current market volatility and the precarious positions of hedge funds as a chance to raise a lot of quick and easy cash to attack that debt. This move could put BILLIONs of dollars back in the AMC war chest and eviscerate that millstone of debt dragging the company down.

With low/no/reasonable debt, there is no short thesis narrative that makes any damn sense, even to people who know nothing about the company. This entire move is built around long-term success, not manufacturing a short squeeze. This is a great time to do it, too. There is likely a huge market correction coming, and movies traditionally do well in recessions as they remain one of the least expensive forms of entertainment available.

It's a smart play if you give a shit about AMC.",ipytwfs,t3_xohljy,/r/amcstock/comments/xohljy/100_support_just_wish_it_was_sooner/ipytwfs/,1,amcstock,False,0,2022-09-26
DaemonTargaryen2024,"OP, let me try to  break this up into more manageable thoughts, then answer what I can:

First a TL:DR - you're both making pretty bad financial decisions. Your mom is worse than you, but you both need to go back to the basics and learn basic personal finance habits, before you even think about investing another penny.

And side note I know it's reddit but you do need to improve your writing, grammar, and syntax. This was really hard to follow. And paragraphs, you have one giant block of text, with a lot of run-on sentences, which are the two ways to disengage and confuse a reader.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the details: I tried to break your post up into smaller chunks:

&gt;I’m 15- almost 16 started day trading and swing when I was like 12 making like 50- 50 us a day but then of course some days I lost 50 -100then I stopped at 14 being in profit 

For starters, you are young, but you're already learning a hard lesson, that day trading is...risky. I personally think you need to completely stop day trading, and refocus to a more balance financial approach with a strict budget and strong savings practices.

Maybe after you have a solid foundation, you can start investing into broad stock/bond ETFs like VTI/VOO for stocks or BND for bonds, nothing speculative and no ""day trading"". The investing should be a LONG TERM pursuit. You should not expect to make quick cash in the market in days, weeks, months. We're talking YEARS.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;one of my moms friends decided who invest and is a penny stock invested or something decided he wanted to help my single mother invest the hard earned money she had saved over the course of 1 year she had invested almost 180 some thousand dollars into various PENNY STOCKS with money from a buisnees she is trying to start to hopefully make more 

Anything done in excess is a huge risk. Even my strategy of broad market stock/bond funds, if done in excess is way too risky. I don't know what her other savings and investments are, but dropping $180,000 into highly speculative investments like Penny Stocks is just incredibly ill-advised.

It appears your mom needs to take a long hard look in the mirror, and educate herself on personal finance principles. And yes she needs to learn personal finance basics BEFORE she continues to look at investing. You build a house from the foundation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I tried to warn her but nothing came from that now she’s down to like 50 bands it’s not my mistake but it’s making me super stressed out as it’s my life and my future depends on it to we are barley doing ok right now with us almost becoming homeless my moms buisnees started to pick up so it’s whatever but we now live ina. 

Your mom needs to hire a financial advisor, ASAP. Frankly any will do based on her decisions, but ideally a CFP who has a fiduciary (legal) responsibility not to ""sell"" her stuff that'll line his pockets, but rather is objectively in her best interests.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Nice house that we are renting who someone else is paying for but the scary part for me is we are not paying the rent if we would be paying it we couldn’t maybe for a month or 2 and now my life is becoming worse as I’m trying to make it fun. 

Sorry I don't really follow what's going on here, other than apparently you're struggling to make rent. I'll reiterate: you're 16, this shouldn't be on your shoulders yet. Your mom needs to re-educate herself and reprioritize. Rent is a fixed monthly expense, it MUST be the first thing you pay yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And yes I had a job and gave all the money to my mom for a few months. I just wanted to tell someone I also don’t know where my dad lives and he is no help to us anyway. 

You may want to have a loving but firm conversation with your mother about money. If you get to a better place when you're an adult but your mother is still stuck in the mud, you'll find yourself sending a lot of money her way. Supporting parents is fine, but if your mom is continuing to make bad financial decisions with no effort to change, that's a problem.

Someone else said it too, you need to prioritize getting a good education. This will dictate your earning potential in your working years, and whether you make $40k or $80k or $150k, everyone will work hard in their lifetime. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The last thing is that I’m really scared for my future as I don’t know what to do and I’m really smart with stocks

You're 16, you aren't smart with stocks. Not taking a personal shot, but aside from you being the next warren buffet, you've got a ways to go before you can consider yourself ""smart with stocks"".

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;and trying to learn as much as I can about realesate and other things 

You need to slow it way, way down. And take a step back and look at your family investing picture: your mom sunk $180k into Penny stocks, you're day trading, and now you're trying to look into real estate. These are not financially secure decisions you're all making. Back it up, learn about the basics of budgeting, saving, and spending less.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;but my sister who is 17 is extremely lazy and has never had a job and all she does is spend money….. I don’t know what to do. 

She's close to being an adult but she's still 17. While you and your mom are working to educate yourselves on personal finance basics, bring your sister into the picture as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I made my mom stop touching any of her stocks as they are mostly worthless now

Priority #1 with these penny stocks, is absolutely don't buy any more. If they ever get above water, sell them. But work all this out with your CFP, who is now your best friend by the way, your mom wants to be in regular contact with him/her for making a financial plan, and any major decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;but she is now focu\[sing\] on picking her medical business up

I don't know any of the details of this. But can I respectfully say that if you guys are struggling to make rent, starting a new business is also extremely hazardous.

KetoKitsune,"Good morning,

The craft fair this weekend went overall just ok. Sales were down but still worth the time. On Saturday we had the winds from the hurricane aftermath and it was pretty scary when it gusted, but overall my tent did just fine and no issues with my display. However, closing up my tent on Saturday night was almost impossible to zip up the sidewalls with how fierce the wind was. Sunday was a lot better weather. Also, I'm not heartbroken on less sales because that means I have more stock for next weekend.

Nervous about the hurricane in Florida and hope all the Floridians in our community are staying safe and prepared for whatever Ian decides to do! My niece is in college in St Petersburg and has to evacuate so of course my sister has been worrying about this. She helped at my market yesterday so when they got the news she had to make arrangements and was super stressed. Luckily we have some family near Orlando, so my niece is going to go over and stay with them, and then if they have to move or anything she will at least be with some responsible adults that will take care of her and move together. She got gas and water already so is all set with that. My sister is a wreck because the college told her they never had to evacuate before when she asked on their initial tour last year, so of course having an evacuation is a bit alarming and indicates they are really worried about the impacts. 

Wedding stuff is getting somewhat more organized. My person doing the ceremony sent me her script for what to say, and its short and sweet and I think just perfect. My photographer is supposed to talk to me today about the details. My shoes are supposed to arrive today after 2 weeks of waiting and needless I say I am annoyed because this Etsy seller told me she would have shipped 2 weeks ago. After work today the boy is going to meet me at the jewelry store so we can get me a wedding band (thanks to pressure from his family who visiting my booth this weekend and pretty much guilted him for not helping me organize wedding stuff when I said I was stressed out and didn't even have my ring yet). I also need to do groceries so will do that first, go home and walk Bento then off to the store. I need to get flowers, so the plan is to do that tomorrow after work. I have a haircut on Wednesday and hopefully my stylist can help me with a game plan for doing my hair for my wedding. Then, Thursday is setup for the big fall festival (that I will get to see Natty at!!) and I will be an absolute mess until Monday doing all the craft things. I cashed my check from the soon to be mom-inlaw and have to mail out money to the venue this week and hopefully that will pre-pay for the food and not have to worry about that. Next week I need to schedule a bath/grooming for Bento so he is nice and fresh and also wanted to do a mani/pedi with my mom and mom-inlaw so I should probably find a time for that too.

I am stressed is an understatement. But, I'm managing it the best I can and it is what it is. Smart me would not have planning a wedding at peak busy season for my craft, but I love fall so it is what it is.

Oh and I Have to get my marriage certificate sometime this week too. I think the boy has Thursday off so maybe we can scoot over and do that after work before I have to setup in Freeport. 

Also... I realized I have no idea what is entailed in changing my name. Is that something I even want to do? It seems annoying however I am painfully traditional with some things so I'll probably do it because I always imagined that I would, but now I'm realizing it might be a bit of work, but I am 95% sure I will be doing it regardless. Is this something I do after the wedding or before or is is part of the license process? Google can help me I know, but just adding this to the list of things I need to do this week. Ugg. Then change my name on all my legal stuff like my business, work, license etc etc etc uggggggggg. 

Love you all, thanks for bearing with me being all chaotic and panicky &lt;3",ipymw7c,t3_xo8igc,/r/xxketo4u2/comments/xo8igc/mon_92622_our_daily_update/ipymw7c/,1,xxketo4u2,False,0,2022-09-26
catterpie90,"You can't really time the market, but we do have tools to say that the market is loosing steam or nearing the bottom. It's more like a forecast. 

If makulimlim sa labas, diba it's common sense to bring an umbrella with you? same goes with stock, when warning signs are there we lighten. And the inverse is true. If the reward outweighs the risk we enter. 

As a retail investor you can't be a pure value investor. We simply don't have the resources that institutional investors have. Example? look at how early Coherent Cloud exited converged (CNVRG). But If you know technical analysis, you would see warning signs in the chart. You might not know the story behind the downturn. BUT you do know na may ngyayari.

For newbies, I would highly suggest starting with position trading AKA following the trend. After you have built a foundation in that, you start tinkering with swing trading. Aka riding when the market is sideways.

# Trading Thesis

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Someone knows something that I don't know. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.",ipyp1i6,t3_xoi53d,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xoi53d/wsb_premarket_community_talk_for_monday_september/ipyp1i6/,1,wallstreetbets,False,0,2022-09-26

shortyafter,"There's this economist William White who says that economies cannot be understood through linear equations and equilibria because that's too far removed from the reality.  Instead, he argues that the economy is best understood as a complex adaptive system.  

Complex adaptive systems exist all throughout nature, but the best example I can give is from the book / film *Jurassic Park*.  We all know the story: eccentric billionaire creates a funpark made with dinosaurs brought back from the dead.  What could go wrong?  But because this is a complex adaptive system, *everything* can go wrong, and it does.  

That's kind of the same thing that can happen with the economy.  William White was warning about it pre-2008, then 2008 happened.  He's still warning about it now.  He argues that the notion that we can just play God with the economy and tinker with rates and influence aggregate demand / inflation without any side effects is squarely wrong.  Instead, he suggests that we can't know the consequences of these things so we should stop trying so much micromanagement.  Instead, we should be trying to beef up the economy for the inevitable moment that the system breaks down.  But that's exactly what we haven't done: debt didn't go down after 2008, it went up.  Way up.  We're more vulnerable than ever.

The thing about complex adaptive systems is you never know where they're going to break down.  The previous breakdown is not going to be the same as the next one.  Very few expected subprime to bring the whole system down in 2008, in fact Bernanke was saying it should have just been ""a bad day in the stock market"".  Well, what I'm starting to see with currencies is worrying me.  The system is starting to look very vulnerable and I'm worried that we're headed for collapse.  

And we have nobody to blame but ourselves.  Years and decades of loose monetary policy put us in this position, and now we're going to pay for it.

Osiryx89,"&gt;Checking that out, most of the ""market rate"" you're citing came in over the period of the crisis meaning they're pricing in the money generated basically from profiteering:

It's entirely reasonable to use those figures, profiteering or not. If the market got wind of a mass nationalisation, you'd see market prices rise *even further*. Look at what happened to Twitter stock when the news about Musk originally broke. Truss has made it clear a windfall tax isn't on the cards too, so little risk of that.

Also, the £130bln doesn't cover profit. 50% of UK gas comes from Norway and LNG. At least half of that bailout is simply covering the commodity cost, a cost which is relevant regardless of nationalisation or not, unless you plan on nationalising Norwegian companies too ;)

The awkward truth is that the real beneficiaries are the renewables companies. They can price match to gas generation but don't have to worry about the cost of gas, but this is where the complications start to come in: it all depends on how their offtake contracts are structured. They could be making £20/MWh, or £400 (with the vast proportion of that profit) depending on what was signed and when. Many people don't realise this.

&gt;Prima facie that's just not a good argument. I'd need to do research into what happened individually to those companies

The entire premise and business model was inherently flawed. These council run energy suppliers thought they could ""cut out the fat"", however realised too late that energy supply has a profit margin of about 2-4%. There's very little fat to cut out of energy supply.

&gt;And yeah, nationalisation isn't always the answer, but every experience we have is that it is the answer in the case of natural monopolies like utilities,

But power and gas supply fundamentally isn't a monopoly. Neither is energy generation.

If your argument is nationalisation in response to monopolisation, this is absolutely zero ground to nationalise energy beyond the grid itself (which is a tiny proportion of the fat in your bill, and tbh the DNOs do a decent job).

Duckney,"https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/

Just go down the list - ""low to moderate income households will receive ..."" Subsidies stop altogether or greatly decrease dependent on income. 

Poor people aren't buying new cars period. A new mid size SUV costs near $30k. That being said - cars like the Chevy Bolt EV cost near $30k and come with anywhere between $5k and $7500 in tax credits. ICE cars don't have those tax incentives - in a sense making electric cars cheaper to purchase. 

Your statement on Oil and gas companies - whether you want to believe it or not - is true.

https://thedrillings.com/usa/leases?&amp;disposition=5

There are 54000+ authorized leases for oil and nat gas. Some of these are open, but others are being sat on because it is simply less profitable to do so than keep supply artificially low. Why would companies have sacrificed profitability under Trump? Because they thought he was cool? These leases are sitting dormant because they are making hand over fist without them. Why spend resources and crank up supply when you can make record profits. 

Renewable doesn't equal only solar power - that's 1 way to get there but nuclear, wind, hydro/geothermal, and solar in places like AZ, NV, CO, NM can all provide energy alongside the existing natural gas and oil systems in place to raise our independence on energy and lessen the need to buy oil from other countries and corporations. Natural gas is cheap now but what if companies continue to keep supply artificially low because they can? 

Biden's budget has been lower in terms of deficit than Trump's so I don't understand why he gets all the negative blame for bloated policy. Under Trump our company had some of our worst years on record because of material tariffs and labor shifting to overseas. The largest ever tax bill was passed to the primary aid of billionaires and corporations - with rising tax liability every year after the bill had passed for myself - firmly middle class.

If you stopped getting pay raises at your company - leave. I stopped as well so I made a job change and I'm back on track. Companies don't look at the president and punish their employees accordingly - at least good ones don't. 

Sounds like you didn't properly diversify if your savings and 401k were all but wiped out since Trump left office.

AutoModerator,"The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.

Partially inspired by recent [reporting from the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/19/podcasts/the-daily/queen-elizabeth-king-charles-commonwealth-united-kingdom.html?searchResultPosition=1), I've been thinking about what this means for the future of Western Liberalism. 

The TL;DR:

1. Inspired by the BLM movement in the US, many former British Colonies that are still technically part of the [Commonwealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) with the British Queen/King as head-of-state have moved or look to be moving to sever official ties with the Monarchy.
2. Northern Ireland and Scotland have had rumblings for a bit now about independence, and following the death of Queen Elizabeth, those [rumblings have gained some additional volume](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3192185/queen-elizabeths-death-reignites-debate-over-scotland).
3. Inside the United Kingdom debate on removing the Royals as head-of-state has [similarly gained some traction](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/25/queen-is-dead-long-live-king-british-monarchy-republicanism-charles).
4. The United Kingdom is 4 separate countries united in a Kingdom. So if the monarchy were to be abolished, the fate of the UK vs the 4 member countries is a bit up in the air.
5. The UK has significant diplomatic power, disproportionate to it's direct military and economic power in large part due to the Commonwealth of Nations, its relationship with the US and the history of the Monarchy and the British Empire.

This also couldn't come at a worse time for the UK, considering it is still reeling from Brexit both [socially](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/business/dealbook/uk-britain-economy-boris-johnson.html) and [financially](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/sep/01/energy-crisis-uk-households-worst-hit-in-western-europe-finds-imf), is being squeezed economically by the [energy crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/sep/01/energy-crisis-uk-households-worst-hit-in-western-europe-finds-imf) due to the Russia/Ukraine war, and the GBP is at a [historic low](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-09-26-2022/card/british-pound-hits-record-low-against-dollar-0pg0WCi1CfllbNlnn9ra).

davethebear612,"Pooph is BLGO technology that is marketed by Ikigai. BioLargo is able to pursue other markets for their product, but pet odor is reserved for Ikigai. 

I have been digging into some of the past brand sales that the advertisers (IKIGAI) of Pooph have executed.: [FLAWLESS BRAND SALE](http://investor.churchdwight.com/news-releases/news-release-details/church-dwight-acquire-flawless-brand-475-million-plus-earn-out)   
""Church &amp; Dwight Co., Inc. (NYSE:CHD) has signed a definitive agreement with Ideavillage Products Corporation to acquire the FLAWLESS:tm: and FINISHING TOUCH:tm: brands of hair removal products (“FLAWLESS”), the market leader in women’s electric hair removal products, for **approximately $475 million in cash plus an additional earn-out payment of up to a maximum of $425 million, in cash, based on a twelve-month net sales target ending no later than December 31, 2021.**""  
""FLAWLESS’ net sales for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $180 million with EBITDA approximating $55 million (approximately 30% EBITDA margin) over the same period. FLAWLESS is the #1 women’s electric hair removal brand in the U.S. focusing on brows and face while the women’s hair removal category has historically been focused on legs with manual razors and blade products. The products are marketed in the U.S. and over 30 countries. Approximately 10% of net sales come from international markets.""  
This is a brand creation that Dennis referenced in the Q3 call in November. Ideavillage Product Corporation was the entity that created the brand and executed the sale. This was not Ikigai doing the brand creation, but Jordan Stanley (of Ikigai) was involved with Ideavillage at the time: [JORDAN STANLEY JOINS IDEAVILLAGE](https://drugstorenews.com/center-store/jordan-stanley-joins-ideavillage)   
**BioLargo will be getting 20% of the total sale of the Pooph brand. That's already decided (along with a 6% royalty on all sales until that time + being the supply chain partner for the CupriDyne concentrate used to make Pooph).**  
There's no guarantee that the sale deal resembles the above transaction and a brand sale is never a guarantee until it happens (though the track record of the advertising folks is truly industry leading), but it's a real example of a Jordan Stanley brand sale deal. In this example, the brand was sold for 5x the trailing-twelve-month sales revenue. BioLargo gets 1/5 of the sale total. That's honestly pretty convenient for estimation of potential BioLargo revenue associated with a future sale. **Annual sales = approximate BioLargo cut of brand sale (if the FLAWLESS deal structure were to be followed).**   
Ikigai's initial target was for sales to ramp up to $100M in annual revenue, meaning that following this deal structure would bring in a cash injection that is almost double the current market cap of the company. Dennis mentioned a target of a billion dollars a year during a February 3 Stock Day Podcast visit. Even the low target is significant. The current annual sales rate for Pooph is around $35-$40M so they are well on their way given that the initial target was for 4 years and this is still less than a year in.  
A few months ago, Ikigai indicated that responsiveness to the advertising material had been 850% of projections. I don't think that means the sales projection can be assumed to be 8.5x, but that video is a huge show of enthusiasm about the current success of Pooph from an absolute advertising giant who's done it many times before. Febreze, Snuggie, Swiffer, Oxi-Clean (remember Billy Mays... RIP) are all things that are in Jordan Stanley's past.

Cruian,"&gt;I’m debating of adding QQQM now instead of VTI given that I have a longer horizon

Why? Small value is the address with the bes5 expected long term returns, VTI good at least some coverage of that, QQQM doesn't.

What makes you think that:

* Financials will under perform other market sectors over your investing lifetime?

* That ""which of the US exchanges a stock trades on"" is a key factor in future outperformance? Why do you want to own Pepsi but not Coke, for no reason other than Pepsi trades on Nasdaq and Coke on the NYSE?

With QQQM, you are saying you believe both of those things.

&gt;Was curious if this would be severely redundant idea.

Yes. Almost all of QQQM is already inside VTI.

gotificial,"Thank you. I don't know if I understand correctly, but my thoughts on whales are as follows.  
  
After all, whales are also the limitation of decentralization. Tax evaders and money launchers are also the limitations of decentralization. There is no perfect organization in the world. The idea of ""decentralization is perfect"" is a dangerous idea. Eventually, it must be controlled wisely. The control itself is neutral. It shouldn't be excessive. It should be appropriate. The same goes for decentralization. It shouldn't be excessive. The problem of whales is also one of the limitations of decentralization.  
  
In the stock market, there is a regulation that criminal punishment is imposed on stock price manipulators. Manipulation of stock prices and manipulation of coin prices are essentially the same. If blockchain has some mysterious ability to prevent the manipulation of whales, control is not necessary, but if not, the same regulations on whales should be enforced in the coin market. There is no reason to treat it differently from the stock market.  
  
In the end, this problem must be solved on the blockchain side, and it is not something anyone can do on behalf of. That's why I'm emphasizing the active role of Ethereum Foundation. It is irresponsible if it just shouts decentralization and do nothing.",ipzkxuh,t3_xoko8v,/r/ethereum/comments/xoko8v/my_two_posts_were_recently_removed/ipzkxuh/,1,ethereum,True,0,2022-09-26

# Trading Thesis

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Someone knows something that I don't know. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.",iq3hku5,t3_xpfgiw,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xpfgiw/wsb_premarket_community_talk_for_tuesday/iq3hku5/,13,wallstreetbets,False,0,2022-09-27

But the (long) lender from whom the shorted share was borrowed from would want it back, in order to receive (for example) the stock dividend that is the subject of the Share Surrender.

H2kilo,"Nobody knows, and anybody pretending to is lying. ABTC has experienced some minor delays and setbacks, but the primary driver of negative price action right now is macro market pressure. It's ugly out there. If you think that the macro market is going to continue going down, maybe wait. If you think this OTC stock that hasn't released significant news in months will hold its own in the vast ocean of the stock market, get in and hold on.

The argument for getting in sooner than later is that the federal government is supposed to announce grant recipients in the next month or so. There's also a shareholder meeting coming up. These are big ""IF"" moments. They could ultimately bear no fruit.

The argument for waiting is that they continue to tread water (running radio silent as they have been, whether that is because they have no news to share or because they don't want to share it is up for debate) for the foreseeable future. Continuing to run silently means that they run the risk of following the market wherever it goes.

Walternotwalter,"Based on the divergence between AAPL and the SPX I see today's bump as just further indication that foreign money is using the U.S. stock market as an inflation hedge.  The truth is that this will continue happening not based on any real new trend but based solely on the continued deterioration of currencies.  It's also self-perpetuating, when stock values go up, weaker currencies then have a harder time buying them.

This is a vicious spiral and will continual basically monthly until the Fed stops raising rates which will likely lead to domestic buying of risk-on, but strengthening of weaker currencies, thereby causing the same to occur in reverse.

Until the volatility drops a bit and the S&amp;P holds range tightly for a bit and that AAPL divergence tightens, this is not favorable movement.

username10983,"In general I think it is a good idea to avoid ETFs that significantly overlap, try to keep the number of holdings low, and keep fees as low as possible.  VEQT holds a globally diversified ETF with Canadian, US, international and emerging market stocks.  You can check this by going to the fund page and looking at its holdings or check it out on morningstar.  Adding VFV (US stock) or VDY (canadian dividend stock) just adds more US and Canadian which you already have in VEQT.  

I think this just adds complexity, reduces diversification, and defeats the purpose of an all in one ETF.  Now maybe you really want to fine tune the asset allocation to overweight canada and us, but then you can unbundle the funds into two (canadian + world) or four (canadian + us + developed intl + emerging) and save a little on MER.

I've had a low cost basis I actually have been holding on for months before we had that $72 run up. And I didn't sell a single share. I truly believed in our movement. So that's why I didn't sell. Despite the several run ups we had during all this time. I still kept holding. Long enough to see my shares become long. But ever since I read our ape shares can become diluted. That's when I started considering selling. And I tried to talk to apes here but of course that went no where. And I can clearly see what AA is actually doing. Instead of bringing in additional forms of revenue. He's just going to dilute us to hell. And the squeeze will never happen. What's the point of all our DD if the CEO of the company is actively finding ways to fuck us over. We VOTED NO to dilution and the CEO just finds a way to bypass that and now both our stocks are at 52 weeks lows. And everyone here just eats it up. I'm glad there's plenty of apes that are seeing the truth to all this.

  


But hey. I'm not against a squeeze. If it actually does pop and all of you make significant gains (especially the $50 and $72 apes). Then all the power to you. The opposers would be wrong and you guys make your money. Perfect. That's what everyone wants. And that's what we are here for. Cause in the stock market.

FatFiredProgrammer,"&gt; genuinely asking.

(Using very round numbers) OP is currently _losing_ 10% purchasing power on his cash this year because of inflation. HYSA might _reduce_ that loss. 

We don't know when the market will correct and rise again. Maybe next month. Maybe next year. Maybe 5 years. Maybe 15 years.

OP's choice then - from my perspective - is to accept the steady erosion due to inflation or place a bet on the stock market or find some other asset or investment vehicle (gold as an example). Over the _long term_, the stock market is a pretty good bet. With a short time horizon, like OP, it's a lot riskier --- but there are no good options for OP right now.

indiaredpill,"A partial explanation for this could be that any news (good or bad), results in lots of options play. I tend to agree with Strawberry's repeated claims that the big money managers manipulate stock price to harvest as much profit as possible from the options plays of retail investors. During times of no news when options play volume reduces, the big money managers do their real buying. This is but only a partial explanation.

The other side to the Tesla share price is the demand from the stock buyers, of course. As we all know, the market is not always rational. The fundamentals of Tesla alone are not enough to goose the demand for the stock. Something else needs to happen that causes the general investors and the institutional investors (not the relatively small group of well-inform TSLA retail investors) to move their funds from other investments where they are tied up to TSLA. As things stand today, the TSLA and Elon FUD has a real effect on dampening the demand from the general investors.

GDP saw continuous growth every year, unemployment pushed down every year, the annual federal deficit reduced every year, and the stock market more than doubled.

ChipperHippo,"Great sleuthing. 

We are now in a situation where the Cuban price increase has opened a market for very, very, very good-looking fakes to flood gray markets. For far too long has the fake Cuban market been reliant on pawning fakes off unsuspecting buyers, but at $2000 a box for Behike's--and particularly the percent increase in price over the last couple of years--this incident is entirely too predictable.

MF's supplier is clearly compromised at this point, and it's made worse by the evidence of gaslighting a rather insular set of loyal customers. I can't imagine how this sub could keep them on the approved vendors list after this incident. Both bad cigars and bad faith are at play here. 

Larger than this is that either the distributors or the downstream gray market streams are compromised as well, and there's a very good chance that any vendor--even LCDH if it's high enough in the chain--could also be compromised. I'm hoping iHav, TCs, and others are taking notes and checking their stock at the moment.

Bionic_Hamster,"Treat it like any other debt.. Some debt is better to pay off earlier than others. Those with 2-3%  should probably never make any extra payments, they are coming out way ahead in an inflationary environment. As that rate goes up the calculus changes. 5.5 is not super high though and personally I wouldn’t be too focused on paying it down early. Even one extra *principal* payment per year will shave many years off the life of your loan and save you a ton of interest.  ..so if you plan on staying in this property long term maybe that’s one way to go. Pay down other higher interest debt first. 

If house prices fall and you don’t pay it down, you can end up underwater (owing more on your note than the house is worth), and you won’t be able to sell without covering the difference. The more principal you pay off (aka increase your equity) the less likely this becomes, but you might end up losing that equity when you sell since the bank always gets their money before you get any equity. One year is too short to really see any significant equity gains though. 

The idea with debt is basically “what else can you do with your money”? The traditional example is that instead of paying down your mortgage you invest it in the stock market because stock market returns have historically outperformed what we that mortgage is costing you. Stock market returns are something like 7-10% annually, so for people with very low rates it was a no brainer. 10% gains - 3% cost of money (interest rate on thier mortgage) = they are coming out ahead by 7%. As your rate goes up it becomes less and less convincing that investing the money elsewhere is the right move. If the difference is only 1-2% is that meager gain really worth more than paying down your mortgage  secure your home earlier, which is a sure thing?  Not so much. I would wait we until we see signs of the bear market ending before putting money into it…if you can invest after that and ride up with the market rebound, you’ll definitely come out ahead vs paying down a mortgage early.",iq3lffc,t3_xp8dca,/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/xp8dca/is_there_any_benefit_to_pay_off_a_mortgage_early/iq3lffc/,2,FirstTimeHomeBuyer,False,0,2022-09-27

PoppinZs,"“When my five-year old attends a birthday party, she brings a present, then often leaves with a bag of token gifts from the host. The exchange happens even if she doesn’t stick around for long.

Special purpose acquisition companies offer a similar incentive to attract capital, but the division of spoils can be more unbalanced. 

Take Getty Images Holdings Inc., which briefly became a meme-stock — rocketing fourfold after its July SPAC listing. The image and video content company was able to cancel the financial party bags normally reserved for the hedge funds who provide the capital (and the retail investors who trade it), while corporate insiders were rewarded with a sackful of extra gifts.   

Story continues below advertisement

It’s a convoluted tale of financial engineering highlighting the perverse consequences of a stock being hyped online. It shows the importance of studying disclosures and paying attention to skewed financial incentives. 

To recap, in return for seeding a SPAC with cash, investors (often hedge funds) are given warrants granting them the right to purchase additional shares in the merged company for $11.50, or slightly higher than the $10 price at which SPACs sell their stock.

The warrants provide extra financial upside, and they can be retained even if the investor chooses not to fund the merger and asks for their money back, which happens a lot now that SPACs have become the most reviled Wall Street invention since the collateralized debt obligation.

Story continues below advertisement

Getty Images’s revenue exceeded $900 million last year and it is profitable, yet more than 99% of the investors in its $828 million SPAC — CC Neuberger Principal Holdings II  —  opted out. The deal still closed in July as planned, thanks to additional funds supplied by affiliates of the SPAC sponsor.  

Initially, there was a tiny float of shares available to trade and, as often happens in these situations, retail investors piled in hoping to squeeze the price higher. It worked. The stock went from less than $9 to a peak of almost $38. 

In theory, this should have been great news for holders of the more than 20 million Getty Images warrants because their right to purchase shares at $11.50 was potentially quite valuable.

Story continues below advertisement

But in reality they couldn’t take immediate advantage: The warrants could only be exercised once the target company has an effective S-1 registration statement. So instead Getty Images now had the upper hand: That’s because former SPACs have the right to force warrant holders to exercise if the stock price exceeds $18 for a few weeks or else have those securities canceled for a token amount.

When it announced the redemption of the warrants almost concurrently with the S-1 being declared effective earlier this month, the stock plunged back below $11.50 (because some corporate insiders and institutional investors were now able to sell).Hence, it no longer made financial sense for holders to exercise their warrants and these were likely be worthless unless the stock price rebounds. “The warrant structure and details were established prior to the merger and fully disclosed in connection with the merger transaction,” the company said in an emailed statement.

Getty Images certainly didn’t play nice by burning warrant holders but this was only possible because 99% of SPAC shareholders weren’t keen to fund its merger. To better protect their warrant investment, more of them should have supported the deal.

Story continues below advertisement

Wiping them out benefits other stockholders by minimizing potential dilution. It isn’t the first former SPAC to try the maneuver. Private stock market Forge Global Holdings Inc. did something similar in June. Removing the warrant liability “reduces potential dilution and decreases our fully diluted shares,” Forge told investors back then.So all’s fair in love, war and SPAC-land then? Indeed, it’s caveat emptor, as Getty Images did accommodate other sources of dilution. SPAC founders receive warrants in return for the money they use to set up the blank-check firm, and these so-called “private warrants” can’t be forcibly redeemed. In this instance, the sponsors were able to exercise their warrants in August, thus netting them a chunk of additional stock, which is nice for them.Adding insult to retail and hedge funds’ injury, the unexpected share price jump triggered several “earn-out” clauses, meaning tens of millions of additional shares were issued to Getty family members, and a few million to the SPAC sponsors. Plus about 6 million employee share awards were unlocked by the gyrating stock price. And naturally this added dilution caused the stock to sink even further.  

Fortunately, the SPAC’s share investors weren’t harmed because almost all of them cashed out. Warrant holders’ losses might also have been worse: Normally the warrants and shares move in tandem, but in this instance the warrants trailed far behind, indicating investors didn’t think the squeeze would be sustained. I tip my hat to this SPAC investor and Twitter user who foresaw exactly what would happen.

So what have we learned? Getty’s earn-out clauses were poorly designed — the share price triggers were deemed met after just 20 days. As I’ve noted before, a temporary jump in the stock shouldn’t result in a payday for corporate insiders, yet somehow this keeps happening. 

Story continues below advertisement

To prevent warrant holders being kneecapped in future transactions, the SPAC rulebook should be revised so the redemption price trigger starts after the S1 is declared effective, by which time the share price should have settled down.Given such misaligned financial incentives and volatile post-merger trading, no wonder nobody wants to join the SPAC party anymore.”",iq4a2be,t3_xpkqpu,/r/SPACs/comments/xpkqpu/spac_meme_stock_a_dangerous_combination_analysis/iq4a2be/,2,SPACs,True,0,2022-09-27

MufugginJellyfish,"I think a lot of people on this sub have been burned so many times that seeing even a little bad news is enough for them to run away. There's a lot of negative sentiment in the market rn as it is. Personally I still believe AVCT/Kandy is a solid buy for Microsoft, they would benefit significantly and AVCT's future doesn't look pretty if they don't get bought out, so all of the motivation is there. They've also made several filings (as well as a lot of other DD) that points to buyout.

A lot of people are wanting more solid evidence for the buyout which is understandable, but I mean... that's how speculation works. By the time there's solid evidence for a buyout, it's priced into the stock and there's no more money to be made. The money comes from making guesses based on DD and then getting lucky and being right.",iq2biou,t3_xp4l01,/r/Shortsqueeze/comments/xp4l01/avct_going_down_a_rabbit_hole_of_just_how_much/iq2biou/,1,Shortsqueeze,False,0,2022-09-27
adultswim_antifa,"Inflation will raise interest rates. If a 20 year treasury bond is paying 11% per year with no risk for 20 years, and the stock market returns 11% per year plus or minus 15%, why are you buying stocks? You would need more earnings growth or a much lower price to raise the expected return. 

That said, the bond market prices in future hikes. It expects a few large hikes and then easing again. If that's sufficient, the S&amp;P is at a rational price now. But it goes to irrational prices all the time and maybe many more hikes will be necessary.

ram_samudrala,"When I was a grad student,  I was making $10K/year. I was once a  postdoc at $35K.  Once I finished, I started making a LOT more. But I don't think I'm happier now necessarily because of that and those periods were among the very best in my life.

You can ask any academic in STEM especially, a vast majority  will say the same thing. The best periods are their postdocs.  Of course, many of us are  secure with tenure, etc.  but that comes with responsibilities and obligations.  Even though what  my wife and I have in the US is from ""our"" efforts, I'm from a wealthy family and I'm not sure my sister is happier than me even though she has access to much greater wealth than I will have (I left it all to her; though I suppose I  knew my family would always backstop me if needed).

In my 30s my wife and I used to spend all the money we made, no regrets since we enjoyed life when we were young.  We now live far more simply, without any debt, and we give away a lot of money. We don't spend more than $60K/year on ourselves I'd say. 

My happiness for sure isn't coming from material goods or money: it's from the work I do which is incredibly rewarding, trying to cure diseases, etc. there's  no amount of money that could I could personally get that would change that. To the extent I need money (not personally, this is all grants to my institution), it is to do this research. But I'd be happy doing this research spending only $60K/year since what I do is a lot of math and simulation.  It's doing the work itself that makes me the most happy.

What I would say I don't have is the wealth of the 0.01%, that is 100 million dollar wealth, not to buy jets or yachts, but to establish foundations and centres that could drive our research forward. But even that I am not sure would make me happy or happier, just like awards or recognition I get don't make me happy beyond an initial dopamine rush. Beyond research, what makes me the happiest is my freedom. I do what I want without concern for money, i.e., there's no one telling me to do something I don't want to do except for constraints I put on myself and I'm not sure money beyond a certain level enables this.  But if I had a large foundation, that may well change. From my family and also  from my own personal success, my view is that the money is the root of all evil. I try very hard to avoid its corrupting influence.

Apocalypsevip2022,"With the rapid development of computer technology, some people are still operating futures themselves, which is subjectively traded futures, while some people rely entirely on computers to place orders automatically, which is quantitative trading. So far, quantitative trading has been increasingly recognized by investors.  
  
Apocalypse said that the advantages of quantitative investment lie in discipline, systematility, timeliness, accuracy and decentralization.  
  
1. Discipline: Encrypted transactions on the Apocalypse platform strictly implement investment strategies and will not be changed at will as investors' emotions change. This can overcome human weaknesses, such as greed, fear, fluke psychology, and cognitive bias.  
  
2. Systematic: The systematic characteristics of quantitative investment include multi-level quantitative model, multi-angle observation and observation of massive data.  
  
In addition, the processing capacity of big data can better capture more investment opportunities and expand greater investment opportunities in the vast capital market.  
  
3. Timeliness: The Apocalypse platform's own monitoring mechanism can track market changes in a timely and rapid manner, constantly discover new statistical models that can provide excess returns, and find new trading opportunities.  
  
4. Accuracy: Accurately and objectively evaluate trading opportunities, overcome subjective emotional deviations, and make a profit.  
  
5. Decentralization: Under the condition of risk control, quantitative investment can be used as a tool for diversification.  
  
In the digital currency crypto trading market, quantitative trading generally tests quantitative strategies through massive historical data simulation tests and simulation operations, but there are also many potential risks, which are mainly divided into the following categories:  
  
1. Completeness of historical data:  
  
Incomplete market data may cause the model to mismatch the market data. The change of the style of market data itself may also lead to model failure, such as trading liquidity, price fluctuation amplitude, price fluctuation frequency, etc., while the Apocalypse platform is designed to monitor market trends in real time 24 hours a day and provide corresponding models to ensure investors' benefits, which is very Good solution.  
  
2. Defects in the design of the strategy model:  
  
Risk assessment and preventive measures that do not take into account the design of the strategic model and the lack of safe risk assessment and preventive measures, which may lead to mismatch between funds, positions and models, and the explosion of positions. Moreover, different strategic models will also show different risk characteristics in different market conditions. In this regard, up to 180 strategies are available in the Apocalypse platform, and corresponding model strategies are constantly updated as the market changes to ensure that investors achieve returns smoothly.  
  
In addition, in addition to the above two points, quantitative trading is a compound knowledge, involving mathematics, statistics, finance, programming and other knowledge. You also need to read the papers of the research report to understand the latest progress, and sometimes need to understand some machine learning. It is difficult for junior investors to get started. However, the Apocalypse AI intelligent quantitative trading platform breaks the routine and truly realizes fully automatic quantitative trading based on AI quantitative investment. Investors don't even need to know about programming and other relevant knowledge, so they can sit back and enjoy the benefits with their fingers.  
  
The Apocalypse platform pointed out that although there are still certain risks in quantitative trading, with the continuous development of technology, the improvement of algorithms and the upgrading of models will inevitably promote quantitative trading to improve the trading winning rate.  
  
Apocalypse said that before designing the AI intelligent robot quantitative trading platform, the company's personnel had carried out a lot of basic research, had a broad knowledge base of statistics and econometrics, and used Solidity, MATLAB, Python. Or rich experience in R programming language implementation. In addition, if we deal with more complex high-frequency end policies, we will also use Linux kernel modification, C/C++, assembly programming and network delay optimization to provide more stability and technical support for customers.  
  
The company is full of confidence in the Apocalypse project as a whole. In the future, it will also develop more projects and fields that can be involved in AI intelligent robot quantitative trading platform, including future versions that will upgrade the stock field, futures field, etc., so as to truly liberate customers' labor force and let robots help investors. Earn more profits in more time and projects.",iq239hc,t3_xp4b38,/r/Apocalypsevip/comments/xp4b38/apocalypse_quantify_the_development_status_and/iq239hc/,1,Apocalypsevip,True,0,2022-09-27

GIA - ibkr account.  Currently no leverage, but ready to use the margin if the market/s&amp;p reaches 30% drawdown

Spreapdbet - futures contracts.  Currently short on s&amp;p and long on wheat and oil (using tight stop losses).  In all honesty I've been trading with this small pot recently, but normally it's long only indexes.

Overall, I'm normally just long only on indexes with an overall leverage of 1.5-2×.  However, with this crash and volatility there is a lot of behavioural reactions in the market that offer short term opportunities.

I don't stock pick, I macro pick varying asset allocation, geography, currency, leverage exposure.

If they kill social security, we’ll be dealing with unprecedented homelessness, starvation, etc. Tye republicans will blame the democrats. It won’t matter if it’s a lie. The very people they fucked over will believe it and keep on voting republicans into office. 

I could see the GOP make it seem like a good thing. Maybe you get a lump sum payment that they say should go into the stock market for a retirement fund. If you have enough money to do that, you’d be able to do that. More than half of the people in this country can’t come up with $1,000 for an emergency. I’ve been poor. That money will be spent on things that have been needed for a long time. Auto repairs. Getting bad teeth looked at. Basic necessities. 

So, it will be a boon for the economy in the short term. Republicans will boast about being the financial wizards they’ve claimed to be for decades. Which they are kind of right - this will boost corporate profits with taxpayer money. And their supporters will cheer them on because all over the news the economy will be reported as doing great. Mind you, that economy is talking about the investor and owner class. 

The working poor won’t get pay increases. The companies won’t hire enough people to handle the workloads. People will get burned out as they have for the last decade and some fresh blood will take their place because they are desperate for a decent job that pays above minimum wage. 

When things get bad and democrats get a majority in the House and the senate is 50/50, the republicans will blame the democrats for the crash that happened right before the election. And 50% of the country will be staggeringly stupid enough to believe it. Rinse and repeat.

# Trading Thesis

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Someone knows something that I don't know. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.",iq878w9,t3_xqbfyd,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xqbfyd/wsb_premarket_community_talk_for_wednesday/iq878w9/,1,wallstreetbets,False,0,2022-09-28

ahj3939,"&gt; If I sell the $22 of VFIAX I recently purchased in the IRA, will that avoid a wash sale?

No. There is no cost basis in an IRA account. When the buy side of a wash sale is triggered you are done. Never in your life can you write off the disallowed loss.

Your two options are to wait 30 days, or for $22 I would just leave it alone and claim the wash sale. We're talking about a $7.50 loss if you're taxed @ 34%.

What you should do is setup your accounts to avoid this situation in the future.

Use totally different ETFs in your taxable and retirement accounts.

S&amp;P 500 is a tricky one because they all seem to track the ""S&amp;P 500 Index"" so I would argue Vanguard's VFIAX and iShares' IVV are ""substantially identical""

So is Vanguard because many of their ETFs are simply a share class of the mutual fund. For example VOO and VFIAX are the same fund, just different share classes. You can call up Vanguard and ask them to convert VFIAX in your taxable to VOO with no tax impact.

If you're selling all the VFIAX in your taxable what you could do is trade it for an ETF that tracks a different index such as ITOT which tracks ""S&amp;P Total U.S. Stock Market Index""",iq9epbi,t3_xqdxpc,/r/personalfinance/comments/xqdxpc/wash_sale_question_accidentally_reinvested/iq9epbi/,1,personalfinance,False,0,2022-09-28

FuzzyBearBTC,"The problem is the UK treasuries (GILT) they are supposed to be very low risk and safe and sound investments, hence why pension funds invest heavily in them as they give a guaranteed return based on the yield, however as the UK is falling apart they have dropped off a cliff thus pension funds would be loosing soo much money that they could not pay out the pensions on a regular basis as the earnings on the bonds will not be realised for many years to come. 

10 year GILT daily chart here https://i.imgur.com/NhZ4J5O.png

My take on it is the pension funds are over invested in these supposed to be safe investments and as the £ crashes further people are dumping them in favour for the US Treasuries with the high $... the BoE needed to stem the flow of selling thus they stepping in.. however last time this sort of thing happened 1987 and Black Monday where the BoE suddenly realised they could not print enough money fast enough to prop up the currency and there was a massive wipe out of the UK stock market. 

Pension funds are not the ones that will be leveraged necessarily but other investment funds will be and using the GILT as collateral for other investments. If these investment funds are then margin called then they are forced to sell GILTs and pushes them lower thus adding to the problem. The pension fund then realises they are in trouble and have to declare that they do not have enough money to pay out their pension responsibilities and have to declare bankruptcy thus their assets are liquidated to claw back anything to their investors adding to the mess even further. Pension funds would be bankrupt and people's pensions wiped out.

That said I agree the risk management of the pension funds should have flagged this potential a long time ago and the reaction of the BoE is just can kicking the problem which will mean much higher inflation than currently is in the UK.

Personally I am not surprised as over the last 15 years there has been a push for everyone in the UK to enrol in a company pension plan directly taking money from your wages as current calculations there would not be enough money from National Insurance contributions alone for a state pension for anyone in about 10 years. This lead to a huge amount of new money flowing into pension funds and new ones popped up and a lot of money was to be made but no employer ever asked or knows where their money is being invested in. 

Pensions have the added advantage where EVERYONE is affected directly as they will loose their pension and all their contributions and it is a great card to pull out for the NEED of a bailout.

I have always opted out of the pension scheme and have to do so every 2 years as I want direct control of my money and choosing where I invest my money... most has gone into DRS GME shares, physical gold, crypto and real estate is the rest. I know where my money is but always got criticised by others for not taking free money and investing in company pension plans.

Look at all the places in Dublin with almost solely social housing...Ballybough, Darndale, Neilstown, Ballymun, Jobstown all  of them have high crime and low social mobility. I do believe that the incentive should be weighted toward the owner occupier with tax policies etc. The solution is to remove all the blockages for developers to build houses  and apartments so the stock increases and the price reduces to a level that a first time buyer can afford. The problem is that you say the word 'developer',  RBB and his ilk shouts NO, the stock remains low, the prices go up more and the only people who can buy housing is landlords who have stock of existing houses as collateral and the cycle continues.

**Description** 
It’s been a while since I got a super sharp linen dial Datejust in stock so when a long time friend wanted to sell it I had to pick this one up. The linen dial on this beauty looks almost brand new like how it left the Rolex factory back in 1979 with the exception of the lume turning a beautiful cream color. The printing of the linen is super sharp/defined and reflects light in such a stunning way. It was cloudy today in NYC so I’m not able to provide the best pictures but even without the sunlight the gold bezel still glows &amp; shimmers. 


Watch has some minor cosmetic signs of wear as expected from a timepiece of this age. No service history and comes with a new genuine date disc. I believe the acrylic crystal is aftermarket.

supreme_meme_beam,"&gt; pursue hobby interests until those become your new career

How realistic is this and do people even want to turn their hobbies into a career? I know I don't. Talking about passion instead of hobbies might be better here.

&gt; That real estate agent who queues up stock trades late at night for pre-market moves and manages to find a trading strategy that gives them more income than their day job?

This is even more of a pipe dream than Sneako's influencer career path advice. Daytrading is not a profitable activity. If there is such a thing as beating the market, you certainly don't get there through a hobby and to make a living off of those returns you need to have retirement level money anyway.

&gt; That truck driver who drives 14 hours a day and decompresses at the end of the day writing their short stories they spent all 14 hours ideating on? That artist working for a AAA studio who picks up Unreal and C++ to make their hobby games before striking it big? All of those are real success stories

Are they real success stories? Do you have actual cases these based on? To me all of these sound indredibly unlikely. Becoming an author that makes more than a truck driver (who make pretty good money) or making a hit indie game as a solo developer is probably even rarer than hitting it big on social media.

&gt; Just tell people to pursue sustainable, safe income while pursuing their hobby interests until those hobbies do a better job of paying their bills than their safe career path and there's no issue.

Grinding on a job you hate while always hoping to make that unlikely dream true is also ver risky. What do you do if it doesn't work out? What did you spend all those years on?

My advice is to take a good look at your options when you are towards the end of high school. Get into something that is a good mix of promise and passion that gives you a shot at your dream but also something to fall back on. Want to develop games? Go into compsci and give it a shot, if it doesn't work you have a solid degree to fall back on. Want to become an author? Go into English go at it and become a teacher or something as a backup. Make sure you are okay with the backup plans of course. College is obviously not the only way and you can also do this much later in life.

A lot of times people just don't have the opportunity to go after what they really want. There's nothing wrong with settling for something that's close enough. The most important thing is being aware of the options, trying stuff and knowing what you actually want and why.",iqafp0v,t3_xqmrnu,/r/Destiny/comments/xqmrnu/the_myth_of_the_young_entrepreneur_aka_why_sneako/iqafp0v/,1,Destiny,False,0,2022-09-28

You can buy a 1-year bond from the UK government for £100 and they will give you £100 + some extra in one years time. In Jan 2020 you would have got £100.619 back because the UK economy was very stable and the finance world had high confidence. Now if you buy a £100 bond you get £103.80 back after a year. This is very bad for two reasons: firstly if the government wants to borrow money it has to pay nearly 6 times more for it, so either they have to raise taxes or spend less. Secondly UK pensions are heavily invested in UK government bonds, as financial markets loose confidence in government bonds decrease in value and your pensions decrease. This further means that the proportion of pensions invested in stocks increases, and so pensions must sell stocks to stay under the government cap for how much of their portfolio can be invested in stocks, which could potentially cause a large market dip. The BOE buying bonds decreases the cost of borrowing, keeps the value or your from pensions dropping, and prevents a stock market dip.

You can put yourself in a position to achieve either or, but the path there starts w/ how you grow in your current role over the next couple of years.

No one knows the state of the labor market over the next 12 months but general consensus is that there will be fewer opportunities at FAANG over the next 12 given headcount growth limitations.

davtruss,"Low interest rates, PLUS the feeling by buyers that if they don't strike while the iron is hot, they will miss their chance. One of the problems of a ""housing bubble"" is that people go all in at a time when market may soon cool off. Higher interest rates. Lower stock market returns. Suddenly people feel poor and unable to purchase the house they wanted if they had just jumped in with the other suckers.

I'm not trying to be snarky. A lot of this is contingent upon the market area. But as a single divorced male who somehow wound up with the house, I'm pretty sure I should have sold it before the pandemic.

What's amazing is that my young adult daughter and her new husband, both of whom have really good jobs, bought a 40 year old ranch style home in an older neighborhood that an old lady's family was desperate to sell, and they have thoroughly enjoyed working together to modernize the home. They have also enjoyed wonderfully low house payments.

7thKingdom,"Said it elsewhere and I'll say it again here...

Perhaps I'm mistaken, and if so I hope someone corrects me. But doesn't that $4.25 price include both 1 share, and the option to buy another share at $4.25 anytime in the next 5 years. That's potentially 14+ million new shares. With 28 million shares outstanding, that's a potential dilution of 50%. Hence the drop by, well, 50%. That part was predictable and I'm sure was factored into when they decided on the price point.

So as for the price point itself, if a share costs $3.00, then that means you are paying $1.25 for the warrant ($4.25 - $3.00 for value of the 1 share) which is the right to buy a future share at $4.25. Why would people do this? Well, leverage... a stock like this really only has two places to go. Zero, or up. Zero if the trials fail or they run out of money before going to market, etc, etc. Up if they succeed.

By paying $1.25 for the right to a future share, they risk less if the stock goes to zero (they simply don't exercise their warrant and lose out on that $1.25 per warrant), at the expense of paying more than current market value if it goes up. Yes, they could just buy the stock at the current price, but that is risking significantly more money now with lots of downside. With this, they risk $1.25 per potential share instead of $3. And when the stock goes up like they expect long term, they can then get those shares at a price well below the new market value.

Lets try to do some math... If I buy 100 warrants for $1.25, I risked $125. If the stock goes to $15 in the next 5 years, I will make $950 ($1500 sale price minus $125 initial purchase, minus $425 to exercise the warrent) while risking only that original $125. A 1:7.6 risk to reward ratio. Meanwhile, if I bought 100 shares, I risked $300, and I would make $1200. A 1/4 ratio. Why is that ratio important? Well lets use some bigger numbers to help show...

Lets say the stock goes back up to $50 dollars in 5 years... I still risked $125, but made a profit of $4450. A 1:125 ratio... If I bought the stock at $3 however, I risked that $300 and made a profit of $4,700. A 1:15.6 ratio...

Why is this important, well it means you could buy 2.4 times more warrants (300/125) for the same amount of money at risk as buying the stock outright. Which means if you were to risk $300 instead of $125 on warrants, you would have 240 potential shares vs 100. Bought at the strike price of $4.25, means you risked $300, paid $1,020 for the shares when you executed the warrants, and made $10,680 (240 shares at $50 = $12,000... minus 300 upfront costs... minus $1020 to exercise the warrant). So in this scenario you made a profit of $10,680 for the same money risked ($300) as someone who bought 100 shares and made $4,700.

That's the value of leverage in this scenario.

Of course, the risk is that if the stock never crosses $5.50 ($1.25 warrant cost plus $4.25 to exercise the warrant), you lose money. Versus buying the stock today at $3.00, where a $5.50 price would net you $2.50 per share. That's the downside of leverage.

Then again, idk what the fuck I'm talking about so I could be totally wrong.",iq9p4az,t3_xqc1ch,/r/MindMedInvestorsClub/comments/xqc1ch/if_mnmd_is_now_trading_at_308_why_would_anyone/iq9p4az/,1,MindMedInvestorsClub,False,0,2022-09-28

ElevationAV,"1%/week is hugely unrealistic and you're highly unlikely to ever meet that goal long term. Thinking you can make \~52% per year is absolutely going to get you burned really fast because you're going to take a ton of risk to do it. IV may be high now, but there's a reason, and eventually IV will drop back down.  


1%/month would beat the historical returns of the S+P over the last 50 years, and that's a more realistic number to aim for  


I've been selling options for a years, and realistically if you account for capital drawdown (which at this point is either long stock that I'm trying to recoup or long term short options positions from rolling) I've got about the same return as I'd have gotten if I dumped it all into the S+P when I started and sold at the start of this year around $480 SPY

Sigaromanzia,"No competitive advantage means the companies have done nothing to earn their extra value.  They got extra value simply by existing.  

Stock buybacks are by definition manipulation.  Yes they are common NOW, but they were in fact illegal before because they artificially increase the price of the stock.  Like you said, cash is king, but they no longer have the cash once they've pumped up their stock price, so now they're sitting on much more volatile assets.

So now you have an artificially inflated stock price, not by virtue of having new cash, but because the money was used only to increase the price of the stock.

The bubble comes into play when the stock market crashes and the prices plummet, and now the hundreds of billions in cash they had are now reduced by at least 10-30+%.  

That's exactly what happened from all the buybacks that occurred from 2017 to 2020.  The once strong ""looking"" companies were now in dire straits when their value collapsed so fast.

The bailout came in 2020 from the government promising to buy $4.5 trillion in corporate debt when the market dropped 30% almost overnight:

https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/digital-images/org/a4ac5572-7790-49c5-bc41-6068cc3f6c8e.jpg

The economic catastrophe became a COVID party like none other by injecting them all with $4.5 trillion of government bailout money (Gov't bailout money being taxpayer dollars):

https://prospect.org/coronavirus/how-fed-bailed-out-the-investor-class-corporate-america/

So there you go, bubble created by turning cash into stock, then the stock prices crashed, so all that precious cash lost serious amounts of value because it was in stock, and not invested back into the company.  They're only still standing because the gov't bailed them out to the tune of $4.5 trillion.",iqb3nbi,t3_xq8a0o,/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/xq8a0o/we_are_so_smart/iqb3nbi/,1,WhitePeopleTwitter,False,0,2022-09-29

shortyafter,"No, UK collapsing *in and of itself* is not likely to precipitate a worldwide financial crisis.  But you have to remember that if the UK falls, that could cause a chain reaction that causes Europe to fall, then emerging markets, and last but not least the US (you choose the order).  It's certainly possible, but it would be due to contagion, and not directly due to the UK collapsing if that makes sense.  The same thing happened with subprime in '07/'08.  Bernanke himself said the collapse in subprime should have been no more than ""a bad day in the stock market"".  

He argued it was a crisis of confidence (""a run on the bank""), which is absolutely true.  That could be a factor that would lead to the outcome you suggested.  Apart from that, there's also the contagion factor - we don't know who has ties with what in the UK (which causes more panic!)

Me personally I'm not so worried about the UK itself precipitating a crisis but rather what it means for the rest of the world.

Upbeat_Criticism9367,"**Nickerbocker Trust**

In 1907, its funds were being used by then-president Charles T. Barney in a plan to drive up the cost of copper by cornering the market. This gamble came undone due to the dumping of millions of dollars in copper into the market to stop a hostile takeover in an unrelated organization. Barney requested a meeting with J.P. Morgan to discuss financial assistance for the bank, but was rejected. The board of Knickerbocker Trust asked Barney to resign after he admitted involvement in the Morse speculations. That afternoon, the National Bank of Commerce announced it would no longer clear checks for the Knickerbocker, triggering a run of depositors demanding their funds back that forced the Knickerbocker to suspend operations. George L. Rives, Henry C. Ide and Ernst Thalmann were named receivers. 

**The failure of the Knickerbocker was the impetus for the Panic of 1907, and exacerbated an ongoing decline in the stock market that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average lose 48% of its value from January 1906 to November 1907.** The banking crisis is also seen as the final event that led Congress to form the Federal Reserve System in 1913.

But if you start with 100 shares of CP rail for example. The 100 shares will still continue to pay a yield despite the fact that the share price is now lower. It is also important to understand that large moat, blue chip stocks associated with a good dividend payment history are less volatile to both the upside and downside.

Having to sell shares when in need of income means that I now have less shares and require the share price to move a larger percentage to get the same dollar growth that the higher quantity of shares would have produced. 

Not to mention that in non-registered accounts selling causes a different taxable event than a dividend.

The growth versus dividend debate also fails to integrate the psychology of holding and DRIPing dividend stocks as you aren't entirely dependent on the share price going up to maintain a semblance of income.

I don't follow silver news that much. Although I own so much of it. (Stack and forget right). 

However for the past 2+ years every time I checked silver redit. There are posts of silver stock leaving vault. Month after month. Yet silver prices keep dropping due to global USD liquidity issues. And raising yields. 

Other than manipulation as all covering reason. 

When would the actual depletion of silver from vaults make a difference to the price? 

People been saying Silver's going to explode in price for years. 
-----+
Now I'm not a silver hater.
I own pretty significant amount. So much I can't even stack it at home. But I purchased it at 13 USD an Oz during that stupid flash crash in 2020 betting it was the floor and thus a form of asset protection. 

I quite like silver 
However I don't see it being an alpha asset where it'll moon or even make big returns. It's really good protection if you buy it at the right price. 

Am I missing something here? 

There's no shortage of silver.
There's no huge industrial need for it that supply can't satisfy. 
If there was the paper market would fall apart.

I mean look at European energy. Critically short. Yet prices capped by government.


Anyone have a different view where there's a world where silver prices are more than protection and actually 4x or 5x?",iqboee8,t3_xqmwu2,/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/xqmwu2/the_silver_bleed_continues_1200000_oz_out_of_the/iqboee8/,1,Wallstreetsilver,False,0,2022-09-29

FirefighterAlarmed64,"&gt;Option 1. He did not answer if sister got the same deal afaik, why assume she did not?... next.

Ignoring part my my comment, to focus on the one part you think you have an answer for.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Option 2. He is being incredibly vague about how everything is being done. And you're disagreeing just to disagree at this point, because I said it exactly as that, I also don't see a problem if he's compensating elsewhere.

Ignoring central point to avoid answering.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Option 3. Option to buy back from OP at a higher price is still on the damn table. Most people have to move, without that option to begin with. Next.

Ignoring the central point I made it's an AH move to force someone to do one of the most stressful thing in human life. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Option 4. Or your continuing logic. Money is something, but a house is nothing. Riiiiiiiiight. What kind of entitle is this? Especially since it affects the resources towards other siblings. Again, before you make any point, I don't feel like repeating the ""as long as things are equitable"" part again and again.

Ignoring central point made that technically she'd be paying into equity, and son not.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Option 5. Really, and I'm just gonna expect that without it being mentioned nor arranged? I'm gonna be paying/helping with my sister tuition/living for university, and guess what, it was laid out, discussed, and agreed upon with my mother. Something with that large amount of monetary value needs discussions.

Ignoring the fact you're argument is predicated on assuming he's NOT doing it, so you're making an assumption either way, just the one to suit your narrative.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And finally, a question I've stated for a fuckton amount of time, and don't bother replying if you don't answer it this time:  
&gt;  
&gt;Why is it ""just a discount"" instead of being a job benefit with gigantic monetary value? In comparison, not exercising your job stock option does not make it not a benefit.

Because it's a completely different scenario. Stock options are not open to the public at same discount when employee refuses. These houses were being shifted and it was a heads up, not a singular offer. 

I've said this a few times. Ignoring every thing you can't  reconcile is the method of your conversation. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As far as I'm concerned, the core difference, dumbed down, for your convenience is this:  
&gt;  
&gt;If this ""discount"" is a gigantic, dollar-value-assignable, perk. If it is a perk, does OP need to take that into account to treat his children fairly.  
&gt;  
&gt;You seem to suggest that because he's not claiming this benefit means it's worthless. Nil and void. It's like saying the money is worthless because the owner intends to incinerate it, and whoever decided to grab the bag grabbed a bunch of ""nothing"".

""Dumbed down"" is interesting when you don't seem to be able to tell the difference between ""because he's not claiming it"" and ""because it would be open to the public after he didn't claim it.""

And at the end there you went back to pretending a discount equals money which is, well I like to avoid complexity, but THAT'S going the other direction, simplifying something down so far to were it becomes ludicrous.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's the thing about forced complexity it's usually only there to bury common sense.  
&gt;  
&gt;Like how you're trying to bury the value of a 3/4th discount as ""He didn't want it. It was now going to go somewhere else.""?

Yes and could have gone to any one else who had a chance. Which you keep ignoring.

You just have to look at the other comments on this post or, you know, reality to see references to there exact types of everything must go situations when WFH became a problem for countless corporations. 

The real estate market, specifically during the first two years, but even now, went through some weird, weird pocket cascades, and even non corporate property buyers were able to seize wild price shifts. But again, ignore anything that doesn't fit.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not to mention, nobody is trying to make this complex but you. Most of the complexity stems from the fact that you, in contrast to common sense, assigns no value to a 3/4th discount, and giving apple-to-oranges examples leading to me breaking it down to precisely why they are nowhere near comparable. Most people would be ""huh, hundreds of thousands of dollars ought to be worth thinking about"".

It's not about assigning value to the discount it's abut evaluating what would cause a FATHER to be an AH in any situation, that would be a combination of financial AND harm reduction. Not what would make everyone most money, because he's a father, not a CEO. These are his children, not board members.

A coupon for baby formula doesn't need to be sold and split between siblings if one can use it to feed the baby. The other has lost nothing. Just because value of the discount increases the core concept is the same. Implying otherwise is like saying a proven mathematical equation doesn't apply when the values are too high. Which is just nonsense.   
*Unless the equation includes time, but I do not think AITA posts are discussing general relativity.*

**Financial sense AND harm reduction cannot be separated when the scenario is about a parental duty of care.**",iqd5jx6,t3_xq9yt9,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xq9yt9/aita_for_telling_my_son_that_i_dont_play/iqd5jx6/,1,AmItheAsshole,False,0,2022-09-29

""The city of Naples was founded in 1886 by former Confederate general and Kentucky U.S. Senator John Stuart Williams and his partner, Louisville businessman Walter N. Haldeman, the publisher of the Louisville Courier-Journal. Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, magazine and newspaper stories ran stories about the area's mild climate and abundant fish and likened it to the sunny Italian peninsula. The name Naples caught on when promoters described the bay as ""surpassing the bay in Naples, Italy"".[9] By the summer of 1888, Naples had a population of about 80 people, and the first hotel opened in 1889.[10] Major development was anticipated after Collier County was established in 1923, the completion of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad extension in 1927, and the completion of the Tamiami Trail linking Naples to Miami in 1928, but did not begin until after the 1929 Stock market crash, the Great Depression, and World War II.

JoeyJoeJoeJuniorShab,"I think we're talking about two separate issues. According to the article you posted:

&gt;(Irish Property Owners Association members pay) up to 55 per cent tax on rental income, (while) real-estate investment trusts are wooed with rates as low as 20 per cent.

So as inflation and costs rise, and [because they are capped at rental rate increases at 2%](https://www.rtb.ie/rent-pressure-zones), small private landlords feel like their investment isn't worth it and so they sell . From the article:

&gt; landlords are leaving the sector even as rents are at their highest rates in years. Asked why this is happening, Conway points out it is only on new lettings that such high “market rents” in RPZs can be charged.

[So small landlords are selling their homes where a new buyer can come in and then set the rent at a higher price.](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/report-claims-rent-controls-have-backfired-and-worsened-crisis-1.4881856)

&gt; This has prompted many smaller landlords to exit the market and to be replaced by institutional landlords with new stock at higher rents.

Now, [according to The Independent:](https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/revealed-ten-biggest-landlords-now-own-17000-homes-41339550.html) 
&gt;Ireland’s 10 biggest landlords own almost 17,000 houses and apartments, estimated to be worth around €7.5bn. 

The article admits that this is a conservative estimate and the numbers are way higher. 

Sinn Fein TD Doherty recently [said this in the Dáil](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/debate/dail/2022-02-15/23/):

&gt;institutional investors have developed monopolistic and oligopolistic pricing power in local areas throughout the State; this is distorting rental and property markets to the detriment of workers, families and struggling home buyers, and is pricing middle and low-income earners out of purchasing or renting from the private market; **a recently published research report by BNP Paribas Real Estate states that 4,900 private rental sector properties were bulk purchased by investment funds in 2021 at 32 per cent above average asking prices**

So it's large, corporate landlords who are pushing out the small landlords and driving up the prices as they continue to consume the already limited supply of housing. Hoarding, if you will.

Take all this anecdotally, but I lived in Dublin during the '08 housing crisis and when the sector crumbled, housing development ceased. Leading up to it, it was like here now: everyone trying to get into the market lest they were left out. That also drove the market hard to record heights (I think my house that I lived in, in Donnybrook - a totally dilapidated affair - would have easily sold for over €1M) and when it crashed, large corporations and [investment firms were there to buy everything up.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-17/private-equity-spends-big-on-irish-homes).

And none of this is taking into account the redistribution of European workers in the tech sector who have all moved to Dublin. [Immigration continues to rise in Ireland[(https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/ireland-experiences-population-growth-due-to-increasing-immigration-rates/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIreland's%20population%20was%20estimated%20to,Statistics%20explains%20in%20a%20commentary.) while the supply of housing can't keep pace.

kelsiersghost,"I worked in a bridal jewelry store from 1998-2008. Certified Diamontologist and Guild Gemologist. Most of that is expired by now, but I still keep my eye on the industry.

Your best bet is to buy your diamond from an online retailer like Blue Nile. They have so much stock, you can get exactly what you're looking for in a budget you want. Most brick and mortar stores will have a ton of crap, followed by a few nice diamonds, and at a huge mark-up. It was common practice to ""triple-key"" our cost, meaning there's a 300% markup as it passes over the store counter.

So, an online retailer needs to keep product moving. Their prices are usually only 1.5-2.2X cost. You get a lot more say over the selection too.  Is it safe? Totally. Diamonds are usually overnighted and fully insured. You generally get all certified diamonds, too.  Blue Nile and Stuller were the big players when I was working in the industry. Not sure who is at the top now.

After you figure out the gemstone you're going to use, it's time to hunt for a setting. 90% of stores will stock their cases with settings from ""Stuller Findings"". Stuller is to jewelry, as Luxotica is to eyeglasses.  Walk into any mall jewelry store, browse around for something you like, give up, and then ask to see their Stuller catalog. They'll pull out a hard-bound book about 3 inches thick.  From there, you can see damn-near every setting available on the market, excluding most of the ""designer"" brands. It's a pretty easy book to look through, since everything is grouped by style and type. 

So, optimal strategy would be to browse a few stores to get an idea and an education about diamonds. Once you get it nailed down, buy online.

evil_little_elves,"Which, as I said, depends on the other factors.

If you're viewing debt as a prison, then by all means you might look at it as something to avoid and minimize at all costs.

Conversely, if you're looking at debt as a tool that can be leveraged, it depends on the other circumstances to determine if it's the appropriate tool for the job.

Personally I'm of the mindset that it's best to limit your debt exposure, in the case of a mortgage, to something that you \*can\* pay in 10-15 years, but structure it so you don't \*need\* to pay it for 30-35 years.  Yes, there's an interest cost for doing so, but if the interest is higher than alternative uses you can pay more than you need to (and the interest by not being required to pay more won't be THAT drastic), and if the interest is lower than alternative uses you can take advantage of alternative uses.

Example: my mortgage is at 2.9%.  I \*can\* pay it off sooner, but it's 2.9%, and I can easily make more than that elsewhere (hell, a CD at the bank almost gives the same 2.9%, and that's about as risk-free as it gets).  If I'd structured it to be a 15y mortgage (mine is 30y) instead, the interest rate at the time was going to be like 2.7%.  At the end of the day, 0.2% means very little and is a perfectly acceptable cost to be able to not pay a higher amount into the mortgage if I can't in a given period and/or prefer to use the money on something else.

The catch really comes down to what that alternative use is.  If your alternative use is buying Legos or eating out more, etc., I'd be right there with you in the ""pay it sooner"" camp.  If your alternative use is calculated investments, I'm sticking 100% with ""pay as slow as you possibly can, given that the cost of doing so is lower than the opportunity cost of not investing more.""  At 2.9% (my mortgage rate) or around 5% (my student loan rates) compared to an opportunity cost of at least 10-15% (a historical return on the stock market at large, presuming index funds) or 40-45% (my personal historical return with what I do on the stock market \[which is more involved than most people are willing to do or even fully understand {I trade derivatives, typically on the S&amp;P 500}\]), it's a no-brainer.",iqcjc7o,t3_xpix4w,/r/Accounting/comments/xpix4w/this_person_is_lying_right_theres_no_way_this/iqcjc7o/,1,Accounting,False,0,2022-09-29
