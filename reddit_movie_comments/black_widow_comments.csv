Reaper-drone,Taskmaster is the main villain of the new Black Widow movie.,fk22qbh,t3_fg0o90,/r/memes/comments/fg0o90/earths_mightiest/fk22qbh/,39,memes,False,0,2020-03-09
Spidey1914,"This would match up with how Natasha is wearing a vest that looks 100% similar to Yelenas, along with the blonde hair in IW. Maybe a way to honor her after her death.

Im honestly fine with this, I know some people want Yelena to become the new Black Widow but I think that would cheapen Natashas death and I think people would be alot more accepting of Loki coming back, what with him being the God Of Mischief vs Black widow coming back because Yelena lives.

All in all my biggest hopes for who lives/dies is that Taskmaster stays alive, and the post credit scene teases a formation of the Thunderbolts. This could easily sprinkle into F&amp;WS.

If Taskmaster dies and we lose another good marvel villain, I'm going to be dissapointed and I think that the hype for Thunderbolts/ Dark Avengers would die down a bit if we lost Taskmaster.",fk274m5,t3_fg3im3,/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/fg3im3/yelenas_death_spoiled_in_the_trailer/fk274m5/,13,MarvelStudiosSpoilers,False,0,2020-03-09

For context this was on a YouTube community post showcasing the examples from the newest Black Widow trailer of Taskmaster using the signature moves of other characters. Had nothing to do with the identity of taskmaster or the casting or anything. I guess not wanting Taskmaster to be a female is a fine opinion to have (though I don’t agree bc I don’t think it would matter either way) but why post it there unprompted? Maybe I’m bias though bc I thought Captain Marvel was an amazing movie and lots of people were mad about the female representation in that, so who knows.",fk1omku,t3_fg0mjx,/r/NobodyAsked/comments/fg0mjx/reminder_that_this_person_has_strong_opinions/fk1omku/,2,NobodyAsked,True,0,2020-03-09

Adventurous-Boss,"Critically: Probably better. Guessing mid 80s, unless they've screwed it up, which I haven't seen much reason to suspect.

Audience/box office: Far worse (unless it gets something like Joker acclaim/legs). And I'm not just talking about coronavirus or even Infinity War/Endgame connections; both of which are huge factors. There's something about audience apathy. Captain Marvel was a new look into the MCU, promised 90s nostalgia and fan service, had old returning favourites, MCU's first female led movie, trailers promising space adventures and were a lot more cinematic. All of these are a better draw for the general audience. The hype behind Black Widow's past has sort of worn off and the character is dead now, so I don't see that much appeal.

Grovesley,"The MCU version has no where near as much experience with prep for fighting, he's far more jump in and see what happens. 

If we imagine that he IS a prepping machine like the comics I see it as follows:

- Black Widow/Hawkeye can be taken down easily, they can't penetrate his suit and he is far faster and stronger. 

- Banner/Hulk could go either way. With lots of prep, he may devise a way to incapacitate Banner before he can Hulk out. Potentially using some sort of relaxant based drugs? If hes already Hulk however he will get taken down eventually after dodging around him for a few hours.

- Cap is an interesting one, BP is better equipped but judging by their side by side running they seem to be in similar physical conditions. Cap has more experience, especially fighting against someone with similar abilities to him. It could go either way.

- Tony could also go either way. If he plays it smart, he'd like see through any prep BP has done and adapt. If he plays it arrogantly he could be taken down. I think Tony has this due to his range and strength. 

- Thor stomps, BP is in over his head here.",fk12d1v,t3_ffwz4l,/r/whowouldwin/comments/ffwz4l/can_black_panther_take_down_the_original_avengers/fk12d1v/,1,whowouldwin,False,0,2020-03-09

Radical_Conformist,"Well, I missed this post and the first 2 films already came out.

I disagree with Mulan, iffy on Black Widow and if anything I think that one would be the first comic book film to make $900M. 

I don’t see Minions dropping hard at least $800M - $900M.

Unsure about Tenet and Conjuring 3 for now but at least $800M and $275M respectively. 

Don’t see Eternals being the biggest of the year but I guess I need a trailer to judge it but it seems unlikely it’ll be at the top, GotG numbers at best IMO.

berantle,"**Episode 7 rewatch** *- The Woman of the Tall Tower*

And we're back to the journey. This time, it's a female robot. She comes across as sad about the effects of the ruin. Then that she look she gives Casshern drops hints that she is a head-case.

She has built a folly edifice on top of a dead spares factory. A factory that looks like an ancient offshore oil platform in the middle of a desert. She shares her dream of building something beautiful in response to the ruin with Casshern. A bell to hang on top of the folly and ring across the world. Seeing how pristine Casshern is, she even takes the opportunity to feel him over. She covets Casshern to be used as the main material for the bell. She says something intriguing - ""You're getting newer and newer, even as speak."" 

Like a Black Widow, she lures Cassshern to her workshop and using what alludes to sleeping scent in the flare candles, it's drugs him into a sleep. Unfortuantely for her, Casshern seems to play along to find out what she intends to do with him. While he was tempted to be destroyed, Casshern still thinks that there is more that he needs to know before the time comes for him to die. Casshern also calls her out for ignoring the thoughts of the robot scraps she uses - alluding to knowing that she has used ruined robots to build her edifice.

Unable to use Casshern as raw material for her bell, she uses whatever she has to cast her bell. Once done, she hangs it at the top of the folly and rings it. It rings out with a dull sound. Her fellow factory robots run up the folloy to castigates Lizbell (her name as revealed by the robots). In the ensuing argument, Lizbell is pushed off the folly and falls onto the surrounding sand dune.. Those robots detach the bell and this ends up destroying the folly. The bell also comes crashing down on her on the sand dune.

Casshern comes by to roll off the bell from Lizbell. Before leaving, he tells her that the ringing bell has reached him. Although it was dull sounding, he heard it as an indication that there can be a new beginning for a dying ruined world.

Some time later when Ohji and Ringo arrive at the same place, Lizbell has rebuilt the folly but without the bell. She takes them up to view the world from the top of the folly. Lizbell proceeds to ring an imaginary bell. She takes to heart what Casshern has told her and she now rings the imaginary bell that now tolls in her heart.

As Casshern continues his journey, we see Friender has gotten just a few steps behind Casshern in tailing him now. From following Casshern and seeing his encounters, Friender appears to be reconsidering Casshern.

***Summary:*** While angst-ridden, Casshern has started to take a turnaround. He is not ready to go without understanding why. Because of his amnesia and lack of understanding, he hears out without prejudice to build his understanding of the world. Even this head-case female robot who dreams of building something beautiful in this dying world.

When Casshern heard the bell ring out, he realised that instead of just waiting and letting the ruin take over or fighting over survival, one can still continue building and making things. That dull-sounding bell is evidence of it. To those of us in our world, this sounds trivial and possibly trite but to one in Casshern's mental condition, it is the spark to reconsider everything. This highlights the thought behind the saying, ""It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness."" We can either curse the darkness (ruin) or just do nothing and continue with the darkness, or we can do something about it to lift the darkness. I choose to light the candle.",fjz6bzs,t3_ffkv69,/r/anime/comments/ffkv69/rewatch_casshern_sins_episode_7_discussion/fjz6bzs/,1,anime,False,0,2020-03-09

T-8-0-0,"I 100% agree. All this talk about Batman should have his own movie first, same for Flash, Aquaman etc. The Batman movie would have either had to have been about how Batman fell which is basically what BvS was anyway. Or before he fell which wouldn't have gone too well leading up to the fallen Batman in BvS unless it end with Black Zero and what a downer that would have been for his solo. 

Looking back the Marvel way feels too forced the other way. Do this and then you can do that. Didn't feel organic. I like that The Flash has done next to nothing before Justice League and it was Aquamans first foray into the stray and set up his own movie really well. It makes sense that characters are met during the travels.

No one has a problem with Luke, Han, Leia, Obi-Wan and Darth Vader not having their own movies first. Same with the Fellowship. That being said Black Widow, Hawkeye didn't have their own movies. They sort of abandoned the Incredible Hulk. Marvel only had 5 movies before the team up. DC had 3. It's not exactly chalk and cheese. Just because Marvel did it that way doesn't mean it's the only way. I found DC's way refreshing. That's not too say they weren't rushing, they probably were, it doesn't mean it didn't work...for me anyway.

also no idea why but i realy like this version of red guardian, since his comic version was a tad douchey.

MatronneGeorgia,"Aren't y'all tired of this false narrative around IG follower counts being exclusively related to ""the aesthetic/the quality of the content""? Every year, there's always some mess trying to explain black queens' lack of followers with ""their feed just isn't good enough or relatable compared to the others, it has nothing to do with race, I just want my feed to be clean and curated, not my fault"". 

White queens in general always get a boost in followers the moment the cast is revealed (and even more after a good episode when they win or something) and if their IG page has the 3-pic pattern, they're on the road to the million. Meanwhile when black queens do the same and do photoshoots and post basically everyday with relevant stuff while the season is airing like Jaida, Heidi, Widow, Ra'jah, Silky and others, it's still not enough. 

Also, y'all also need to stop acting like you only follow people on IG for ""the aesthetic"" or whatever. When yo. Nobody is going to go on their new fave's IG and then say ""wait, the feed isn't curated like I want it to be so I won't follow"".

The issue I think people aren't grasping is that these girls gave absolutely everything, they worked hard, showed all their talent, were even praised on-show for it but it gets ignored.

Heidi literally hadn't slept, just got back to hospital and pulled that performance out.

There is a huge gap in what POC Queens (particularly if they are black) in what they have to do to reach the same recognition as their white (or whiter) counterparts. In other words they have to do so much more for less.

Alyssa Edwards, a endlessly quotable queen with backbreaking stunts becomes one of the top three of all time, Heidi N Closet, an endlessly quotable queen with even more backbreaking stunts... snoozed on. 

We need to be aware of our own racial biases, it's something we learn without realising it and celebrate queens for the work they're actually doing not some nebulous idea of what we think they should be doing which often results in skewed support like we're seeing.

Vin13ish,"This is transcript from a website.

The woman of the Marvel Cinematic Universe are undoubtably tough, but it takes a director like Cate Shortland to tap into their softer sides. For years fans have seen the Black Widow present her deadly facade, but we all know there is more to Natasha Romanoff than what she lets on. It fell to Shortland to bring that history to life in Black Widow, and Shortland is opening up how it felt to oversee such a distinctly woman movie for Marvel.

The director spoke with Entertainment Weekly about her role, and Shortland was open in her discussion of the trauma which Natasha had to go through to reach a place where Black Widow could even happen.

“We just bonded over stories about trust and about intimacy and about women surviving,” Shortland said about her first discussion with the film's main players. “You didn’t have to be a superhero to identify with a woman who has had a really tough childhood and has survived and has a huge heart and helps other people.”

“When I looked at the past [MCU] films, there’s a lot of sitting outside of the character, so that she is seen and kind of objectified,” she continued. “Oftentimes we don’t really get to see who she is when she’s by herself — who she is when she takes off the action-hero facade.”

In Black Widow, Shortland promises to peel back the layer which Natasha has been showing fans for years. The most difficult pieces of her past will be explored with nothing off limits, not even. family. For star Scarlet Johansson, this freedom to explore is plenty inviting, and she feels now is the best time to explore the past which made Natasha into the hero fans love.

“For anyone who said to me, ‘Oh, this [Black Widow film] should’ve happened five or 10 years ago,’ I’m like, it would not have been as substantial. We just would not have been able to do it,"" Johansson said. ""This film is happening now as a result of what’s going o",fk59kvu,t3_fglj8s,/r/marvelstudios/comments/fglj8s/black_widow_director_cate_shortland_on_overcoming/fk59kvu/,3,marvelstudios,True,0,2020-03-10

Thunderpulse,"I like the idea of recreating battles from the MCU, especially the thought of staging an Infinity Gauntlet campaign based on scenes from the Infinity War and End Game films.

So your three games leading up to Thanos could be:

Battle in Edinburgh -- Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Captain America, and Falcon vs Corvus Glaive (or Proxima Midnight) in Avenger Environments (since there's no Scotland environments) (also, Vision was there, so he could be subbed in to replace a hero, although he was wounded pretty badly).

Sanctum Sanctorum Battle -- Spider-Man, Dr Strange, and Iron Man vs Ebony Maw (or Cull Obsidian) in New York.

Alternatively Battle on Maw's Spacecraft -- Spidey, Dr Strange, and Iron Man vs Maw in GotG or Black Order environments.

Battle of Wakanda -- Lots of opportunities, all of which could use Wakanda environments:

Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, and Okoye vs Proxima Midnight

Thor, Rocket, and Groot vs Cull Obsidian or Corvus Glaive

Rocket, Winter Soldier, Captain America, and Black Panther vs Cull or Corvus

Then the final battle with Thanos should be the prime three Avengers: Cap, Tony, and Thor. I read or heard somewhere that against Thanos, if the number of KO'd heroes equals or exceeds the total number of players, the heroes lose. So it sounds like you could have two heroes waiting in the wings to take over if one of the prime three is KO'd. This should be Captain Marvel, and one other (probably Hulk, Back Panther, or Star Lord). Ideally, Tony should be the one to land the finishing blow to Thanos.",fk4od4w,t3_fec6cb,/r/MarvelUnited/comments/fec6cb/discussion_what_order_to_fight_the_villains_lets/fk4od4w/,2,MarvelUnited,False,0,2020-03-10

Her performance had levels to it, she made the smart move of not keeping it at the same energy level throughout.

bvb_101,"With how things have gone so far I wouldn't expect to see Green Goblin till maybe May at the earliest. So far they've been releasing 2-3 character packs/month and up until this month they have been releasing in CPxx numbered order. 

I'm not sure why they skipped CP15 &amp; 16, but I'd expect them to circle back to that next month. If they do a third pack in April that will be either CP19 (which would finish up the Black Order), CP20 (which would finish up GotG), or I've also seen rumors that Hawkeye &amp; Black Widow will be April releases, which probably pushes CP19&amp;20 to May since I can't imagine them releasing 5 packs in a month. Green Goblin is CP21 so if May is a 3 release month I could see him then, or they could easily be slating him for June

All summarized, if I was betting on it I'd say the plan looks something like this

March - CP17 &amp; 18 - Rocket/Groot, Star-Lord

April - CP15, 16, 24 - Proxima/Corvus, Gamora/Nebula, Hawkeye/Widow

Hypothetically, you could say that he had fought each of the Avengers offscreen at some point previous to this movie, but if Black Widow takes place right after Civil War and Civil War is the first time Black Panther and Spider-Man became known to the wider world, it's hard to imagine him learning their moves from anything other than watching their fights on the news or whatever.

One of the red room agents pretending to be taskmaster to fool black widow. Either that or what you said and taskmaster and melina are Co conspirators for this.

I like the idea of this setting up her as iron maiden to be the villain of a Florence pugh centric movie.

Yelena will probably take over the black widow mantle

Ross to definetely come in post credits and either recruit taskmaster or both task master and yelena to a thunderbolts or dark Avengers team. If they do this it'll be interesting to find out what they've been up to since now to post endgame hiding in the shadows.

Red guardian will most definitely die.

Probably won't happen but I would be shooketh if someone turns up from post endgame and is like natalia you need to come with me to the future and therefore she sort of gets resurrected. Not likely to happen but it could.

I don't think nick fury will recruit yelena as a black widow because then why wouldn't she be in infinity war or endgame. But I think she will symbolically be lined up to take over as black widow in the future maybe on her own for a bit and maybe natalia says to her if you ever get lost out there find these people they will always help you.

Ooo just had another thought in Rachel Weisz character what if she has nothing to do with taskmaster who is clearly controlling the red room. She helps black widow and red guardian and yelena to take down tsskmaster and end the red room you think she's a hero and then plot twist in a post credit scene you find out that she used this situation to take over and rebuild the red room with her as leader the iron maiden",fk2z4zo,t3_ffu4qz,/r/marvelstudios/comments/ffu4qz/marvel_studios_black_widow_official_trailer/fk2z4zo/,1,marvelstudios,False,0,2020-03-10

wowthatswildman,"Except in many cases we see the overpowered superheroes causing more damage not less. Hulk can’t control himself and is easily manipulated excluding Dr Hulk they have now, Thor often doesn’t understand midgardian things and the damages and injuries caused while no biggie for asgardians is a big problem for earthlings. Also yes Stark caused ultron, but if something like that happened you can’t just blow it up, you need Hawkeye and black widow to collect intel, Stark to form a plan, and honestly the other avengers could only do damage control without solving anything. “Small bad guys” that hack people’s bank accounts or dump toxic waste into the sea or traffic children aren’t really a good matchup, Captain Marvel doesn’t have clairvoyance, she can’t see the women being sex trafficked like in black panther. For all thors power he can’t clean up an oil spill, Hulk can undo the effects of an earthquake with a super smash.

Dash728,"I have also been thinking about how they would do an Avengers rework. There are currently 14 characters tagged as ""Avenger"":

Agent Coulson, Ant-Man, Black Panther, Black Widow, Captain America, Falcon, Hawkeye, Hulk, Iron Man, Nick Fury, Scarlet Witch, Thor, Vision, and War Machine.

Of that batch, most already have an alternate home:

Agent Coulson and Nick Fury = Shield Team

Black Panther = Wakanda

Falcon, Iron Man, and War Machine = Power Armor

Scarlet Witch = Supernatural

Thor = Asgardians

That's half of the team that fit a specific team elsewhere. You are left with:

Ant-Man, Black Widow, Captain America, Hawkeye, Hulk, and Vision.

Personally I think they break into two teams and we are missing some people:

Wave I Avengers: Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk + 2 others

West Coast Avengers: Ant-Man, Hawkeye, Wasp, + 2 others

Vision is odd man out and I think he goes better on the Wave I team and  you fix him by making his current bonuses apply to Tech OR Wave I Avengers.

All kidding aside, I feel like this one not as egregious on cost.

SantaOMG,"Yeah the Infinity Saga will be a high light in my life. I already miss having these big movies to go to and be part of this cultural phenomenon. It’s only been a year(?) since endgame and I already have this whole in my life that was filled with anticipating the next MCU movie so i could go see it with my friends. I don’t think there will be anything else like it FOR ME because I will always be comparing it to the Infinity Saga. It’s kind of like your first girlfriend or boyfriend. I started watching the MCU with Thor 1 when I was like 16-17. It’s been a long time with the MCU constantly filling the air.

After civil war, I was already kind of just going to the movies because I wanted to keep up with the story. I started watching the MCU with Thor 1. And after being introduced to Tony Stark in Avengers 1, I was hooked. But after phase 2 it definitely felt like the movies were becoming McDonald’s quality. Everything was flat lined and leveled out in terms of characters and in terms of cinematography. You knew what you were getting. It wasn’t going to be great and it wasn’t going to be terrible.

Infinity War surprised me though. I was surprised that it was so good. I loved it and I’ve seen it more than 10 times. Endgame was alright but disappointing. There should’ve been either another hour tacked on to Endgame, or another movie before Endgame.

I’m still going to go see the MCU movies, but I’ll skip the ones that I don’t actually care about, like Black Widow. I’m interested in The Eternals and Spider Man and Captain Marvel.",fk4wv0u,t3_fgar1j,/r/marvelstudios/comments/fgar1j/its_a_beautiful_sadness_knowing_that_well_never/fk4wv0u/,1,marvelstudios,False,0,2020-03-10

MrGains,"If it follows the normal pattern of update releases, we'll probably get one on April 22.  That's a little more than a week before Black Widow.  Perfect time for an advertising tie in for the movie.  If they delay the update a week, even better.  All the movie updates since at least IW (didn't check past that) aside from AMaTW have happened within a few days of their release.  Not enough time for a New Mutants thing and the timing just fits better for BW.  

I'd guess Black Widow and the 5th Anniversary are folded into the same update and it will drop on 4/29.

CivilizationAce,"New story mode to me seems like a fistful of useful bios. Even once I've been through it to get all 3 of the 3099 uniforms (which seem worthwhile, though I think it should be a high priority to replace Cap's) I look at it and see roughly 6 bios per mission, 20 missions, for a total of **120 bios**, including some useful stuff:  
Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Doctor Octopus, Spider-Man, Hawkeye, Red Skull, War Machine, Vision, and Venom.  
I've tended to get more of the above than of the chaff:  
Elektra, Lizard, Ultron, Green Goblin, Agent 13, Bullseye, Kingpin and MODOK, **which you can always throw at Quicksilver/similar**, so it's all good.  
That a 10:8 favorable ratio if you're counting, though I've tended to beat those odds so it may be weighted or some of the villains may not be available at every mission, and with the rumours that Elektra, Kingpin and Bullseye may feature in a MCU film new uniforms are not impossible, so the balance may even improve.  
120 bios is about as many as you'll get from every epic mission put together, and about twice as many as you can get from Dimension Missions. However, there is a downside: Will you have enough energy (both in game (80) and RL) and enough time to run it?

WikiTextBot,"**Stan Lee**

Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber ; December 28, 1922 – November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become Marvel Comics' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics industry.

In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writer/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created numerous popular fictional characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Black Widow, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man. In doing so, he pioneered a more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies.

***

**Steve Ditko**

Stephen J. Ditko (; November 2, 1927 – c. June 29, 2018) was an American comics artist and writer best known as the artist and co-creator, with Stan Lee, of the Marvel Comics superheroes Spider-Man and Doctor Strange.

Ditko studied under Batman artist Jerry Robinson at the Cartoonist and Illustrators School in New York City. He began his professional career in 1953, working in the studio of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, beginning as an inker and coming under the influence of artist Mort Meskin.

***

**Jack Kirby**

Jack Kirby (born Jacob Kurtzberg; ; August 28, 1917 – February 6, 1994) was an American comic book artist, writer and editor, widely regarded as one of the medium's major innovators and one of its most prolific and influential creators. He grew up in New York City and learned to draw cartoon figures by tracing characters from comic strips and editorial cartoons. He entered the nascent comics industry in the 1930s, drawing various comics features under different pen names, including Jack Curtiss, before ultimately settling on Jack Kirby. In 1940, he and writer-editor Joe Simon created the highly successful superhero character Captain America for Timely Comics, predecessor of Marvel Comics.

***

**Jim Starlin**

James P. Starlin (born October 9, 1949) is an American comics artist and writer. Beginning his career in the early 1970s, he is best known for space opera stories; for revamping the Marvel Comics characters Captain Marvel and Adam Warlock; and for creating or co-creating the Marvel characters Thanos, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora and Shang-Chi.  Later, for DC Comics, he drew many of their iconic characters, especially Darkseid and other characters from Jack Kirby's Fourth World. For Epic Illustrated, he created his own character, Dreadstar.

***

**Kevin Feige**

Kevin Feige ( FY-ghee; born June 2, 1973) is an American film producer who has been the president of Marvel Studios since 2007. The films he has produced have a combined worldwide box office gross of over $26.8 billion. Feige is a member of the Producers Guild of America. In 2019, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture for producing Black Panther, the first superhero film ever to receive a Best Picture nomination, as well as the first film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to win an Academy Award, marking it the first time Feige was nominated for an Academy Award, and on October 2019 he became chief creative officer of Marvel Entertainment.

envyxd,"4/5 have officially.

I did some math -

Aiden is the lowest with 69k, Gigi the highest with 189k. Between all five white queens, the average is 129k. They do have the biggest margin in between them - each queen is about 30k followers above/below another (Aiden -69k, Jackie 105k, Jan 120k, Nicky 162k, and Gigi 189k. 

Dahlia is Latinx, she has 141k. Crystal is 95k. 

The black queens have on average 69k (same as Aiden, the lowest white queen!). Jaida has 81k, Widow has 66, and Heidi 59. 

Rock M and Brita have 98k between them if we put Asian/Pacific Islander together. Brita has 81k and Rock M 115.

IN SUMMARY

Yes.. it’s def a bit shocking that the two queens who won aren’t up there with the others. The fact that one that won is the same as Aiden is interesting. 

Anecdotal things:

I’m sure Aja has helped contribute to Dahlia’s following. She has also been doing drag for a while. I’m also curious about followers being bought, but Dahlia is def a sexy queen to get her followers on her own merit. 

Brita is probably more well-known than Jan, but has fewer followers. Jackie has also been doing drag for longer, and slightly less. At the same time, Brita has some allegations against her that could’ve stunted her follower count. 

Most of the queens who have a large following are also from big cities. 

Rock M has been marketing himself super well. 

Rock, Aiden, and Jaida have all mentioned they are somewhat outcasts in their town, may have contributed to their relatively low following. 

Heidi contesting Nicki’s feedback may have hurt her, too? Honestly, she has so much charisma I can’t help but feel surprised she’s the lowest followed queen!

BoomBoomGun,"This is not by any means a description of the queens that you named nor a way for me to tear away at their accomplishments and talents. I'm simply going to comment on the stereotype. Just want to make that really clear before anyone @ me lmao.

By a southern persona I meant specifically kind of like the sassy woman from the south that also has a heart of gold. So, I specified that they make white people feel comfortable because they carry a lot of the mammie stereotypes and often come from a place of struggle which does not challenge of lot of the racial biases society tries to push. They are most often represented as the side kick and not the main character. 

I think the queens you named are clearly human beings with much more nuanced existence to what I dumbed down. But, I think that the average fan will subconsciously gravitate towards queens who check those boxes as opposed to queens that might challenge our racial biases. For example, Widow will take a word like ""ratchet"" and glamorize it as ""a ratchet ass queen with some high class fashion"" and that might challenge the average white fan who might come to subscribe to the idea that ratchet is bad and she should not be happy to be that (and that in itself is problematic because ratchet is often associated to black culture and etc etc etc)",fk686n6,t3_fgjwv0,/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/fgjwv0/vixen_is_here_with_the_real_tea/fk686n6/,4,rupaulsdragrace,False,0,2020-03-11

IceColdPlasma,"I'm only gonna mention characters within the MCU, but you can apply this logic to any character. The MK1 armor is really clunky, and really only has reliable protection against bullets. If a normal human with peak physical strength were to get a good enough punch in then it would most likely fall apart. That being said, it's own strength isn't anything to laugh at, being able to knock down metal doors and launch people with its own fists.

I would think the threshold would fall somewhere around street-level characters like Daredevil and Jessica Jones. Characters like Black Widow and Hawkeye could take it down more easily, but probably not because of their strength but rather their arsenal.

Shieldless Cap is a hard no. He scales to Spider-Man, who could lift a giant metal container(?) (at least I think that's what it was in Civil War), and he can ""stop a bus with his bare hands"" according to him in Homecoming. He technically hasn't shown any feats beyond what Spider-Man has shown (except maybe when he held back Thanos's hand in Infinity War), but Tony said to Peter in Homecoming that ""if Cap wanted to lay you down, he would have"".",fk8tak1,t3_fh1xo5,/r/whowouldwin/comments/fh1xo5/whos_the_strongest_person_mcu_iron_man_can_beat/fk8tak1/,3,whowouldwin,False,0,2020-03-11

And story wise I get it. He meant a lot to Peter but Tony was a stain on so much of the story. So much so that they basically made him a semi God like figure while sweeping everyone and everything else under the rug. 
Yes, absolutely, Tony was *the* one to sacrifice his life in the battle to defeat Thanos but the movie treats that one single act as the only thing that matters. They blink and you miss it include Vision and Black Widow in the school video and that's literally it. Iron man gets emotional montages and murals world wide. 

It was all just a bit too much to the point of ad nauseum. The movie just did every other avenger dirty. 

Another ding for me is what worked in the first one didn't really work in this one. The balance between Peter and Spiderman seemed very off the second time around.

SurlyRed,"DAVID BOWIE: I went to buy some shoes - and I came back with Life On Mars
By DAVID BOWIE FOR MAILONLINE
UPDATED: 21:53, 28 June 2008

For this CD compilation I've selected 12 of my songs that I don't seem to tire of. Few of them are well known, but many of them are still sung at my concerts. Usually by me. I'll start off with the hit.


**Life On Mars**

This song was so easy. Being young was easy. A really beautiful day in the park, sitting on the steps of the bandstand. 'Sailors bap-bap-bap-bap-baaa-bap.' An anomic (not a 'gnomic') heroine. Middle-class ecstasy.

I took a walk to Beckenham High Street to catch a bus to Lewisham to buy shoes and shirts but couldn't get the riff out of my head. Jumped off two stops into the ride and more or less loped back to the house up on Southend Road.

Workspace was a big empty room with a chaise longue; a bargain-price art nouveau screen ('William Morris,' so I told anyone who asked); a huge overflowing freestanding ashtray and a grand piano. Little else.

I started working it out on the piano and had the whole lyric and melody finished by late afternoon. Nice.

Rick Wakeman came over a couple of weeks later and embellished the piano part and guitarist Mick Ronson created one of his first and best string parts for this song which now has become something of a fixture in my live shows.

**Sweet Thing/ Candidate/ Sweet Thing**

I'd failed to obtain the theatrical rights from George Orwell's widow for the book 1984 and having written three or more songs for it already, I did a fast about-face and recobbled the idea into Diamond Dogs: teen punks on rusty skates living on the roofs of the dystopian Hunger City; a post-apocalyptic landscape.

A centrepiece for this would-be stage production was to be Sweet Thing/Candidate/Sweet Thing, which I wrote using William Burroughs's cut-up method.

You write down a paragraph or two describing several different subjects creating a kind of story ingredients-list, I suppose, and then cut the sentences into four or five-word sections; mix 'em up and reconnect them.

You can get some pretty interesting idea combinations like this. You can use them as is or, if you have a craven need to not lose control, bounce off these ideas and write whole new sections.

I was looking to create a profligate world that could have been inhabited by characters from Kurt Weill or John Rechy - that sort of atmosphere. A bridge between Enid Blyton's Beckenham and The Velvet Underground's New York. Without Noddy, though.

I thought it evocative to wander between the melodramatic Sweet Thing croon into the dirty sound of Candidate and back again. For no clear reason (what's new?) I stopped singing this song around the mid-Seventies.

Though I've never had the patience or discipline to get down to finishing a musical theatre idea other than the rock shows I'm known for, I know what I'd try to produce if I did.

I've never been keen on traditional musicals. I find it awfully hard to suspend my disbelief when dialogue is suddenly song. I suppose one of the few people who can make this work is Stephen Sondheim with works such as Assassins.

I much prefer through-sung pieces where there is little if any dialogue at all. Sweeney Todd is a good example, of course. Peter Grimes and The Turn Of The Screw, both operas by Benjamin Britten, and The Rise And Fall Of The City Of Mahagonny by Weill. How fantastic to be able to create something like that.

**The Bewlay Brothers**

The only pipe I have ever smoked was a cheap Bewlay. It was a common item in the late Sixties and for this song I used Bewlay as a cognomen - in place of my own. This wasn't just a song about brotherhood so I didn't want to misrepresent it by using my true name.

Having said that, I wouldn't know how to interpret the lyric of this song other than suggesting that there are layers of ghosts within it. It's a palimpsest, then.

The circumstances of the recording barely exist in my memory. It was late, I know that. I was on my own with my producer Ken Scott; the other musicians having gone for the night.

Unlike the rest of the Hunky Dory album, which I had written before the studio had been booked, this song was an unwritten piece that I felt had to be recorded instantaneously.

I had a whole wad of words that I had been writing all day. I had felt distanced and unsteady all evening, something settling in my mind. It's possible that I may have smoked something in my Bewlay pipe. I distinctly remember a sense of emotional invasion.

I do believe that we finished the whole thing on that one night. It's likely that I ended up drinking at the Sombrero in Kensington High Street or possibly Wardour Street's crumbling La Chasse. Cool.


**Lady Grinning Soul**

Mike Garson's piano opens with the most ridiculous and spot-on re-creation of a 19th Century music hall 'exotic' number. I can see now the 'poses plastiques' as if through a smoke-filled bar. Fans, castanets and lots of Spanish black lace and little else. Sexy, mmm? And for you, Madam?

This was written for a wonderful young girl whom I've not seen for more than 30 years. When I hear this song she's still in her 20s, of course.

A song will put you tantalisingly close to the past, so close that you can almost reach out and touch it. The sound of ghosts again.

**Win**

This is not, you may be speechless to learn, an ode to Winifred Atwell, though I almost wish it were for she was a real winner. In the Fifties in England it was virtually impossible for a ten-year-old to hear boogiewoogies and rags unless our Winifred was playing them on her 'other' piano.

At home in Trinidad she'd been brought up with blues and R&amp;B and had played it for the American GIs who were based at what is now the main airport. Winnie was the first black artist in Britain to sell one million records. She was tops.

No, this song is about, er, winning. David Sanborn is on sax. He was experimenting with sound effects at the time and I'd rather hoped he would push further into that area, but he chose to become rich and famous instead. So he did win really, didn't he?

**Some Are**

A quiet little piece Brian Eno and I wrote in the Seventies. The cries of wolves in the background are sounds that you might not pick up on immediately. Unless you're a wolf. They're almost human, both beautiful and creepy.

Images of the failed Napoleonic force stumbling back through Smolensk. Finding the unburied corpses of their comrades left from their original advance on Moscow. Or possibly a snowman with a carrot for a nose; a crumpled Crystal Palace Football Club admission ticket at his feet. A Weltschmerz [world weariness] indeed. Send in your own images, children, and we'll show the best of them next week.

**Teenage Wildlife**

So it's late morning and I'm thinking: 'New song and a fresh approach. I know, I'm going to do a Ronnie Spector. Oh yes I am. Ersatz, just for one day.'

And I did and here it is. Bless. I'm still enamoured of this song and would give you two Modern Loves for it any time. It's also one that I find fulfilling to sing onstage. It has some nice interesting sections to it that can trip you up, always a good kind of obstacle to contend with live.

Ironically, the lyric is something about taking a short view of life, not looking too far ahead and not predicting the oncoming hard knocks. The lyric might have been a note to a younger brother or my own adolescent self.

The guitars on this track form a splintery little duel between the great Robert Fripp and my long-time friend Carlos Alomar.

**Repetition**

By virtue of the instrument's classical baggage, Simon House's violin touches a vein of pure Goth on this recording. There's a numbness to the whole rhythm section that I try to duplicate with a deadpan vocal, as though I'm reading a report rather than witnessing the event. I used to find this quite easy to accomplish.

I decided to write something on the deeply disturbing subject of wife abuse in the manner of a short-form drama.

I had known more instances of this behaviour than I would have preferred to have been made aware of and could not for the life of me imagine how someone could hit a woman, not only once but many, many times.

**Fantastic Voyage**

It's almost quaint, this one. It has a strong feel of the Fifties variety show to it. A cavil in passing - if I'd been in the position of the mid-Sixties Rolling Stones, I definitely would have gone on the Sunday Night At The London Palladium show's revolving stage.

They had refused to stand on the roundabout with the other acts at the end of the show, as it didn't fit in with their rebellious image. I was surprised to read that the American entertainer Judy Garland also refused a whirl, as she was too emotionally upset. Who knew?

I would have been shyly clawing my way past Jimmy Tarbuck to get on. I remember my mother being excited about the first time this show appeared on television in 1955.

My father had bought our set for Princess Elizabeth's coronation in 1953 and it had opened up a new world for us. Guy Mitchell was apparently an exciting part of this world as my mother went all schoolgirl when he came on screen and sang She Wears Red Feathers (And A Hula Hula Skirt).

This song's chord structure (Fantastic Voyage, I mean, not She Wears Red Feathers) appeared on the album Lodger in two forms. First, as it appears here and then further in as Boys Keep Swinging (they were men's dresses, I tell you). Both the tempo and top-line melody are rewritten.

I did this again on the album Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps). It proved nothing. Thinking about it, Guy Mitchell would have done this song proud.

**Loving The Alien**

I'm trying to come up with a little-used word for each song entry. I've not got one for this song. And this song is not, it may surprise you to know, another ode to little green Martians. Oh, recidivism, that'll fit.",fk8wmvb,t3_fh0wkb,/r/DavidBowie/comments/fh0wkb/found_this_really_interesting_article_from_2008/fk8wmvb/,3,DavidBowie,False,0,2020-03-11

It's not like it would be the first time that happened.  The initial silhouette previews said May for the hero that turned out to be Doctor Strange, then the official announcement article said April (presumably they copy + pasted the paragraph from the Black Widow article) and the upcoming products page now says May.

Plus remember how the core game was October but then it was November, and Green Goblin, Cap and Ms. Marvel were supposed to be November, December and January respectively, then they all got pushed to January only to then all be released in December?

Tweedled1psh1t,"Easier HoM titles: Kurzick/Luxon supporter aren't bad because you only need to reach rank 4 to get them dedicated to the HoM instead of max level like a lot of other titles. Eternal Conqueror of Sorrow's Furnace is doable without too much effort with heroes, its a series of like 5 quests that all take place in the same area in prophecies.

Heroes/Pets: Getting black moa and imperial pheonix are super easy and you can death level them in the menagerie to get them level 20 so you can add them to the HoM. Black widow spider is more annoying to acquire. Hero armors either require doing the respective challenges and hope for drops or buying the trophies from other players. 

Armors: Obsidian is significantly more expensive than all the other ones. The cost for Kurzick/Luxon and Vabbi compared to other prestige armors is very dependent on material needs. Kurzick/Luxon needs specific faction material in addition to other materials while also costing the same base platinum as other prestiges while vabbi has cheaper pure platinum cost but the materials needed are noticeably more expensive (rubies and sapphires). When crafting prestige armor the headpiece is not needed to add it to the HoM so that will save you some currency.

Weapons: Tormented ones need armbraces, though you can get 1 free one during wayfarers reverie once per account (event that happens in august). Oppressor ones can either be bought from other players or acquired after completion of the war in kryta storyline (late late game). Destroyer weapons are crafted on the first level of a dungeon in EoTN.",fk6bfkj,t3_fgomta,/r/GuildWars/comments/fgomta/some_advice_on_new_campaigns_runs_and_easier_hom/fk6bfkj/,2,GuildWars,False,0,2020-03-11

Steathler,"&gt;NTs are remembering JUST the proportions of the eyes, nose and mouth.

What else would there be in the face to be recognized aside from the aforementioned things?

Also,

&gt;NTs?

Does that mean people with Proso aren't neurotypical? I thought, to some degree, not everyone is ""neurotypical"" i.e it is a definition to separate people with ASD from those who are not. But, then again, the definition can easily encompass many people.

&gt;Try watching some of the deep fake videos people have been posting on here. See if you can recognize the faces when they're on a different head and body.

Yes, I have, actually- referring to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Prosopagnosia/comments/ffezdi/if_the_original_star_wars_was_remade_in_2020/), having never watched that scene or the entire Star Wars franchise, I thought Princess Leia's nose - in that scene - was kinda familiar; Scar has a somewhat bulbous tip. Though I couldn't pinpoint who, but then after Han Solo's counterpart there, I thought his facial hair was somewhat familiar (and a bit of his tanned skin tone, too!).

 After seeing a clean-shaven young man, I then deducted that it was Tom Holland who plays Spiderman as the dude next to Han Solo, Scarlett Johansson who plays Black Widow (Lucy, too) as Princess Leia, and Chris Pratt playing that dude in Jurassic Park (I did not see it either but I now connect him to the that franchise) and Peter Quill in the Marvel series as Han Solo.

Taskmaster is 2 people a man and Rachel Weisz character. It's plausible that 2 of them use the taskmaster identity. Or like the man is the taskmaster fighter but Rachel is taskmaster leader of red room

Taskmaster is rsche Weisz people say that this was debunked in the trailer because Rachel is flying the helicopter that taskmaster is on top of but I recon she will be getting red room agents to be decoys.

Rob_Vegas,"So about the Black Widow movie, I'm pretty sure *actual* Taskmaster will be the one that shows up after the credits in his comics-accurate  costumery.

I think the other Taskmaster we've seen in the trailers are actually Task Force members, trained by Taskmaster to mimic the Avengers. I forget their specific names but there was one named Blood Spider who was trained to fight like Spider-Man, there was one specifically trained to fight like Captain America, one for Hawkeye, one for Black Panther, etc. They all wear identical gear.

So that last trailer we saw Tasky with a bow, the Tasky with the shield, and the one with the panther claws, I'm pretty confident those are Task Force and not Taskmaster himself changing styles throughout the movie.

I *won't* be dissatisfied with either outcome, by my childish giddiness would be tickled if it were actually the Task Force.",fk7r3hj,t3_fgjz3e,/r/Heroclix/comments/fgjz3e/stoked_for_the_motorcycle/fk7r3hj/,1,Heroclix,False,0,2020-03-11

* **Mojavi:** *Sweet Myrrh, copal resin, sandalwood, and tonka bean stung with our hot desert sand accord.*

* **Satin Sheets:** *Dragons blood tinged with crimson rose petals, nag champa, oakmoss, aged patchouli and black vanilla.*

HikingTheChemTrail,"Well aware of the effect on humans - although I'd put a caveat even there, there are contradictory studies. Brown widow venom has been analysed and it's essentially the same as black widow venom and the different effects are explained by the fact that brown widows inject only a fraction of the volume of venom in one bite that other Latrodectus do. I still wouldn't bet on that and let my child or my grandmother handle one. 

And there actually are studies on Latrodectus venom effect on cats and the consensus is that they are much more susceptible to it than humans. Not only because they are around 1/20 of the body weight, but also because the venom has higher effect on them, for unknown reasons. 

Hence why I wouldn't let cats play with brown widows - the fact that they inject much less venom can still potentially have harmful effects on them. 

Also, cats are dumbasses that like to agitate spiders, pretty much the only way to ensure to get bit.",fk7ucr9,t3_fgz8o0,/r/spiders/comments/fgz8o0/id_request_please_miami_fl/fk7ucr9/,1,spiders,False,0,2020-03-11

JediMaster80,"Devs did this for Legendary in The Division 1 as well and haven't learned.  
They forget this isn't classified as ""challenging"", this is actually called ""Artificial Difficulty"" and ""[Fake Balance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance)"".  
  
-----  
(Quote from Fake Balance Page)  
Fake Balance is what happens when a game or an aspect of a game seems balanced on paper, but actual playing reveals major problems that were not anticipated by the designers. This is a reason why a game can have Character Tiers despite being balanced in theory.  
For clarification, Fake Balance is caused when the game designer intends to balance the game but fails to do so.  
  
--------
Yep, this sounds exactly what's going on now.  
  
Quote from OP:
&gt;(The NPCs get armor, health, and damage scaling based on the numbers of players in the group)

&gt;They have to scale the armor, health, and damage of the NPCs because they can’t just add more NPCs in the confrontations. (for various performance reasons) While the scaling is not that noticeable on the red-bar enemies, it becomes very obvious on the elite and named enemies. But that scaling of elite and named NPCs is over tuned for three and four-player groups at the moment.  
  
This is the biggest bullshit ever, that they ""can't add more NPCs"".  
I could maybe see a mild armor and health scaling (and I mean mild), but DAMAGE scaling that high, hell no.  
This is Artificial Difficulty at it's finest. It's made uber hard, just to be uber hard, slow players down, and impede progress.  
This shows the devs didn't learn from their mistakes from Division 1 and it's Legendary and Heroic difficulties.  
  
My question to the devs, when the hell did these enemies become Captain America and super soldiers?  
They are obviously super soldiers enhanced with a serum that allows them to be faster than Olympic record holders, stronger than the Hulk, and have the aimbot of Hawkeye or the Black Widow.  
In short, if the enemies are as strong as Marvel or DC superheroes, the devs fucked up.  
  
There is a difference between being ""hard"" and ""just plain unfair"" and the devs crossed the line already.  
Devs need to read the TV Trope [The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard) and make sure the enemy AI isn't like this.  
They also need to make sure The Division 2 can fulfill the [Rule of Fun](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun) trope and right now, it isn't fun with their idea of [Fake Balance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeBalance).  
  
YES, THEY CAN add more NPC's, especially if they do it smartly, they just aren't thinking outside the box.  
Adding multiple sections of enemy reinforcements would be the first thing.  
Maybe constant reinforcements (after you kill at least 75% of the enemies) as you push and progress into the room and they would keep sending more until you push through the room or section far enough.  
  
Note: All of this would be done WITHOUT uber enemy armor, health, and damage increases.  
  
Second, adding more ways enemies can spawn into sections and rooms, while changing it up can go a long way to keep players on their toes. Possibly have some enemies come through a locked door we see, or drop down from a vent in the ceiling.  
The obvious is to have a few enemies (usually shotgun or melee rushers) spawn from behind, so players have to constantly watch out. They can keep it random and not timed at a specific respawn wave so players can't time it and it feels fresh, they show up when we least expect it.  They could even use delayed spawn tactics where some enemies spawn, then like 20 to 60 seconds later, spawn shotgunners or melee rushers from behind.   
  
Doing this would allow them to have more enemies (but not too many like 30+) where it might cause some performance issues.  
Enemy skills shouldn't take entire teams of focus fire for a minute or minutes to destroy. Not sure if they did it (as I know they did it in Division 1) but enemies also should be forced to play by the SAME RULES as the players, so they should NOT be able to place down 2 of the same skill (like 2 support stations or 2 turrets). I'm mentioning this now, so in case they aren't now, devs don't try to do it later.  
  
Devs need to be smarter on this, and with constant nerfs (removing skills on weapons and most armor is an EXTREME Nerf) need to stop.  
Maybe they should learn to beta-test the fucking game FIRST before pushing it out. They have a Division 2 PTS so USE IT.  
Let us test things there, get feedback on what works, so you don't have to scramble to make changes.  
  
Had the devs done this, it wouldn't be as bad as it is now.  
Now, before they or anybody else says, they could have put everything BUT the Warlords of New York levels/area content in the PTS.  
They would have probably gotten soo much feedback on what we want and what works, this TU8 could have been miles better, but isn't.

After having some self control for months, I finally went and bought a bottle after it went on sale for about $85 compared to $100.

**On the turntable:** Miles Davis: Four &amp; More

**ABV:** 49.5% ABV (99 proof)

**Distillery:** Widow Jane (MGP)

**Age:** 12 years old

**Specs:** from the website... ""All Widow Jane whiskeys are proofed with pure limestone mineral water from the legendary Rosendale Mines of NY, just 100 miles north of our home in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Aged 12 years, high rye, single barrel 99 proof bourbon"" (MGP whiskey)

**Price:** $85

**Nose:** Cherry, subtle minerality, gummy bear, dill, earl grey, fresh mint, strawberry.

**Feel:** Medium, more juicy than viscous. Lights up the tastebuds.

**Palate:** First thing I get is the rich cherry syrup, then some of the minerality which is somewhat acidic, then some stone fruit tea like a black tea infused with peach. Then towards the mid palate you get a cayenne pepper style heat that builds and warms. Not spicy like a black pepper.

**Finish:** Medium length with mellow rye, clove, red and gold gummy bear, licorice, black tea, mellow oak spice, black pepper.

**Notable Comparisons:** I got this around the same time as Michter's 10 and I always thought they were similar. I finally side by sided them and they are similar in regards to complexity, balance, and the overall drinking experience. Main differences being that WJ has the cherry main note and minerality where M10 is more honey sweet with a longer finish.

**Conclusion:** I'm a big fan. I was very skeptical with how much the limestone water would make a difference, but it does. The minerality adds a level of complexity and activates my tastebuds. It results in the pour feeling juicy like when a freshly cut apple hits your tongue. Very different from the Dickel experience where it's more of a main note. You get a tasty MGP 12yr SiB proofed down to a solid point that adds to the mouthfeel and balance. Overall it's a well executed bourbon that I think is a easy buy at the sale price of \~$85. At $99 though it's starting to push it, but this is equally as good as M10 and probably much more attainable so I give it a strong 4.

**Score:** 4

1 - Ok - wouldn't buy another bottle

2 - Solid - I'd get another at the right price.

3 - Very good - I'd want to have this on hand all the time.

4 - Exceptional - I'm stocking up and buying multiples if I can afford it.

5 - Top shelf - tasting I'll never forget. Having a pour when I really want to treat myself.",fkcmvw7,t3_fhq2lq,/r/bourbon/comments/fhq2lq/review_7_widow_jane_12yr_sib_magruders_pick/fkcmvw7/,1,bourbon,True,0,2020-03-12

terraformthesoul,"As easily as she did, no. But as much as people here are talking about how much ridiculously stronger men are than women, which is true, they aren’t mentioning how little strength it actually takes to hurt a person if you know how and have the personality to do it.

 They mostly had black widow going after weak points, and using her whole body weight and legs in attacks instead of arm wrestling for a reason. A dude being able to lift 300lbs vs a woman lifting 150lbs doesn’t really make that huge a difference when it comes to a kick in the throat.

Likewise, a lot of a fight depends on someone just having the type of brain for it. Even with training, some people lean more towards flight or freeze, and they don’t process what’s happening in a high pressure situation easily. Some people are wired far more towards fight.

In a real life example, and not just super heroes, Even before I started working out I was able beat a guy going to a military academy who tried to assault me. Part of it was I had a lot more motivation to win, but a lot of it is that my brain works well under that kind of adrenaline rush, so I was able to decide the best way to attack, whereas his actions were less focused. 

So while actions movies do continue to be unrealistic, a trained female assassin could most likely still kill a gym bro without using a gun.",fkcqm88,t3_fhex4r,/r/relationship_advice/comments/fhex4r/my_girlfriend_is_very_upset_since_i_won_against/fkcqm88/,4,relationship_advice,False,0,2020-03-13

CCRyan40482,"It has been rumored the illuminated elite use sexual abuse to control one another as well as satiate their sexual appetites....bunch of sick bastards.

Prime example would be Americas Rom-Com wife and husband,Danny Masterson and Bijou Phillips....yikes!

Masterson fills the shoes of the stereotypical rapist all too well and gives new life to the phrase ""stanger danger!""

 I always thought there was something off about Masterson after seeing him in a few movies and That 70's show but I just figured the offset feeling was an aspect of his character Hyde's persona influenced and pulled from within his real life.However, Masterson reminded us all to trust out guts and never forget a spider in a pair of corodoray's will always be a spider!

Speaking of spiders, its surprising Masterson's wife Bijou Phillips has not killed him yet, black widow style! But I suppose so long as your husband's not raping you and you have an outlet,such as other beating fellow employee's at the workplace, you will be ok. Several allegations against Bijou beating fellow cast members on the sets of movie shoots have begun circulating. Bijous Phillips may saddly already have been damaged goods as her half sister Mckenzie Phillips claims to have had a conentual sexual relationship with her Father, singer of the Mamas and the Papas, for over a decade.

galaxy_umbri,"I personally think the bigger story/concern for not only Marvel but other movie studios is how is this thing going to effect future releases. 

There was a story just yesterday that Tom Hanks got the virus while filming a movie himself. So let's that Disney/Marvel continue to observe the spread of this things and local governments start the crack down on what can be done. Production on something like Doctor Strange 2  could be postponed, and could be pushed back until July of 2021 or later. 

So it's fine for Marvel to sit on Black Widow and wait, but if they're production not only on the movies but the Disney + plus are postpone, that's where you'll really see a lot of the ripple effects of this.

They didn't set aside nazism but most of these people try to escape reality by going through the pages of the comics or dressing as character that they like from the comics instead of thinking what happens out the in the world for a bit moment of imagination. The actual problem is people like you who can't differentiate between fictional world and the real world which you think the one and the same and later on (hopefully not) people like you will start doing bullying or even worse killing people who dressed as something fictional that you don't like, the person who does things in the article you mention earlier was the same as you cause he thinks what happens in the comic books could always be done in the real world which is totally false in every way, comic books is fictional but real world is our life and not one and the same. Nazi is a tragedy that we all should remember and never do what they did in the past but that doesn't make it that we couldn't enjoy comics just because SI, apocalypse, magneto or talos wanted to reign supreme over their races which again, only happens in comic book pages.  

the point is I'm not saying that you can hate on hydra but all I'm saying you can't just judge people to be a nazi when all they did was loving or dressing as something from fictional world, judging and envies something is always the start of bigger tragedy so let them having fun with the update they like and you can wait patiently when the update that you like are coming and rejoice then.

I love carnage to the bone but I won't judge or hate on group of people who loves when X-men, Hydra, phoenix five, black widow or black order update comes along, I won't call them nazi, communist, mutants freaks or genocide lover just because they loves and likes those guys and patiently wait for one day symbiote update comes along with either T3 or awakening skill for carnage.",fke46lc,t3_fgpull,/r/future_fight/comments/fgpull/march_sneak_peek_4_marvel_future_fight/fke46lc/,1,future_fight,False,0,2020-03-13

t-shinji,"I’ve found relevant information on Band-Maid and Glay. They first met in January 2017.

Miku and Saiki appeared on the radio show *Mucomi+* on [January 18, 2017](https://www.allnightnippon.com/mcplus/information.php?date=2017-01-18). Hisashi of Glay appeared on the same program following week, on [January 25, 2017](https://www.allnightnippon.com/mcplus/information.php?date=2017-01-25).

&gt;
&gt; Aaagh!! Wh, what, … I wanted to listen to it even more, po… (cry)
&gt;
&gt; Thank you very much, po 🕊

The following is an excerpt of the radio show [*Mucomi+* on January 25, 2017](https://youtu.be/gdZih2i1qh8?t=287) (from 4:47):

&gt; Yoshida (MC): Hisashi-san, speaking of your speediness on your favorite things, this is really just by chance, we had Band-Maid as guests last week. Satorena, do you remember that?
&gt;
&gt; Satorena (MC): Yes, I remember. 
&gt;
&gt; Hisashi (Glay): I met Band-Maid at the new year party, …
&gt; 
&gt; Yoshida (MC): Did you meet them at the new year party?
&gt;
&gt; Satorena (MC): Ha ha, what a great new year party.
&gt;
&gt; Hisashi (Glay): Kobato-chan.
&gt;
&gt; Yoshida (MC): Yes, yes. Last week, she sat there and said po, po, po, po.
&gt;
&gt; Hisashi (Glay): Ah, is that so? She invited me to their concert and I went to see them immediately after that. Well, that was amazing. They played really professional, I mean, legitimate hard rock, and their songs were also legitimate.
&gt;
&gt; Yoshida (MC): For us, first we notice only a black maid who looks just like a widow, and the one who plays heavy but talks everything with po, po…
&gt;
&gt; Hisashi (Glay): Yes, yes (laughter).
&gt;
&gt; Yoshida (MC): Strange maids.
&gt;
&gt; Hisashi (Glay): We use guitars of the same maker [note: [Hisashi uses a Zemaitis too](https://www.digimart.net/magazine/article/2014111301173.html).]
&gt;
&gt; Yoshida (MC): Oh do you?!
&gt;
&gt; Hisashi (Glay): We were excited about that.
&gt;
&gt; Yoshida (MC): Wow!
&gt;
&gt; Satorena (MC): Great.
&gt;
&gt; Yoshida (MC): Those maids were authentic like that.
&gt;
&gt; Hisashi (Glay): Yes, they are really authentic. I was really surprised. They will be big in 2017, I think personally.
&gt;
&gt; Yoshida (MC): They get big in 2017?!
&gt;

HotZoneKill,"* I must say, this has been a really depressing Friday the 13th.  

* On the fence of weather or not I want to see *Black Widow*.  One hand, there's things that really piqued my interest (Taskmaster, David Harbour, more female characters in leading roles, etc.) but at the same time I can't ignore ScarJo's prior history.  I want to say that it's easy to separate art from the artist, but it feels like I'm making excuses.  On one hand, she's not the worst offender in Hollywood: there's plenty of actors who've gotten less flack than her for whitewashing and were way more egregious and dickish about it (Jim Sturgess and Zack McGowan) and there's celebs who've outright committed hate crimes against Asians and still have their careers (Mark Wahlberg and Logan Paul), yet whenever celebs being shitty towards Asians gets brought up, she's usually mentioned way more than the others.  But at the same time she still defends Woody Allen, so whaddya gonna do?

* Coronavirus fears aside, I'm really looking forward to [Marvel Land](https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/11/21173186/marvel-land-avengers-campus-disneyland-california-adventure-rides-characters-dining).  Was expecting *Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure* to be more like *Rise of the Resitance* but it seems like more or less *Toy Story Midway Mania!*.  I appreciate that it's not trying to be a copy of *The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man* at Islands of Adventure (my favorite ride after *Resistance*).  God forbid I ever go back on *Guardians of the Galaxy — Mission: Breakout*; got really sick after going on it.  Wonder what the big ride at Avengers Headquarters is going to be.  Interesting that for the live show, it's Captain America, Black Widow and Black Panther fighting Taskmaster; I think the lineup and plot will change as more movies come out, like Shang-Chi joining in ect.  

* Calling it now: Desmond Chiam, Miki Ishikawa and Carl Lumby are playing Lin Sun, Lotus Shinchuko and Isaiah Bradley in *the Falcon and the Winter Soldier*.

How is it the most accurate, where are they getting they're player count? I can't just claim that the earth is flat because it's clearly the most accurate statement (the earth is round).

Why should I trust you that there's 60,000 bots? That's a BOLD claim and you can't just say ""trust me"" and expect that to pass as valid evidence.

Wrangle is op but in a pub setting I've actually never had an issue with it, in comp I agree it is absolutely op. Black box is not overpowered by any stretch of the word. Conch is maybe marginally op but it's certainly not problematically op and people would generally place other banners above it outside of payload defense. Ubersaw is op but in the same sense that the escape plan is op, the other options are pointless so the extreme situational upside of the weapon is an improvement.

Honestly most of these items boost survivability so it sounds like you need to stop over committing for kills, I'll give you that the wrangler, diamond back, and crossbow are op.

Ok? The reason doesn't justify the fact that they've taken no action.

&gt;How is it the most accurate, where are they getting they're player count? I can't just claim that the earth is flat because it's clearly the most accurate statement

“I think this character’s strength really lies in her vulnerability and her acceptance of that,” she said. “She has emotional intelligence that has allowed her to survive without any real superpowers. She’s someone who is a problem-solver. She’s a pragmatic person. I think a lot of those qualities are inherently female. I hope that this film continues pushing that boundary, so that we can actually have more female superheroes who are inherently female, and aren’t just Batman in heels or whatever,” the actress said.

She’s referring to female superheroes being able to be feminine. Qualities like vulnerability and emotional intelligence. Specifically the quote has zero to do with Batwoman and 100% to do with the character of Bruce Wayne being the opposite of those things and how she doesn’t want male macho scripts just copy/replaced from he to she and how Hollywood should develop true female characters rather than just “strong” ones.",fkeooe4,t3_fhyhew,/r/BatwomanTV/comments/fhyhew/im_seriously_pissed_at_how_these_articles_just/fkeooe4/,1,BatwomanTV,False,0,2020-03-13

Moviefan2017,"It depends. 

Films that are supposed to be released in 2021 and beyond have stopped filming so if those movies also get delayed some of the ones that were supposed to be released around now may just wait till next year to release.

For example, I think Disney films like Raya and the Lost Dragon, Eternals, etc will probably stay at their release date if things get better. If those films stay in their spot late 2020 might be okay for cinema. 2021 films like Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, etc may get delayed if they stop filming. If those films miss those dates it’s possible that films like Mulan, Black Widow (films that are supposed to be released around now), etc take their dates instead.

Universal is another good example. Fast and Furious was supposed to be released in May but got delayed to April 2021. Universal also announced that Jurassic World 3 is going to delay filming. If they delay filming then it’ll probably miss it’s June 2021 release. If Jurassic misses its release that’ll even give universal more of a reason to keep Fast and Furious in 2021.

So overall if things get better in a few weeks/months, I think films like Raya, Venom, Eternals, Dune, etc will keep their original release dates. Films like Black Widow, Mulan, Quiet Place and Fast and Furious I think will release in 2021 because I think they will need to replace films that were supposed to release in 2021 (Jurassic World, The Batman, Spider-Man, etc).",fki8rs2,t3_fij2e3,/r/movies/comments/fij2e3/serious_discussion_will_things_get_better_for_the/fki8rs2/,1,movies,False,0,2020-03-14

Paperchampion23,"Im curious as to how all of this will affect the slate

- Black Widow: is a fully complete film (finished reshoots, etc) but likely will not premiere in May.  Maybe a July/August premiere?

- F+WS: Didnt finish filming, let alone possible reshoots after filming. Might not make that August Premiere. This show has gone through a lot of tough filming scheduling.

- Eternals: finished but likely has reshoots. This may be okay, especially if they do reshoots middle of the summer when things hopefully turn around. Probably will be fine for November.

- WandaVision: See the above. Might be fine for its December release.

- Shang-Chi- If they are able to continue, they will. I dont think itll miss its Feb 2021 date.

- Loki: Completely suspended filming. Like the other D+ shows, might be fine by the time they can film again. 

- Doctor Strange 2: was supposed to start filming next month. I wonder if this will affect Cumberbatch's tight schedule.... probably wont start filming to the summer

Spider-Man 3: MAY be fine tbh, by the time it starts filming, procautions will be a little lighter.

But they would still have made way less money. 

Disney is doing that with movies that are over in the box office. They are in that weird period where the movie is earning absolutely nothing so it's all benefit for them to do that.

Disney delayed Mulan for example and I'm sure they'll delay Black Widow soon enough, so they're doing the same thing with their movies going in theaters",fkgy83l,t3_fiewyd,/r/television/comments/fiewyd/walt_disney_will_fasttrack_the_release_of_the/fkgy83l/,1,television,False,0,2020-03-14

pinaysarahcasm,"No Toot or Boot post re runway this episode on this sub  right?

If not then IMO:

Aiden Zhane - BOOT. I don’t see effort. I don’t see gown. I don’t see dress. I don’t see pants. Just her favorite wig.

Brita - TOOT. It’s cute, good fit on her. I just wish I didn’t see the black undergarment because it breaks the pink fantasy on the runway.

Crystal Methyd - BOOT. I saw her on red already. I just wish this is very colorful to make it more fun and more present like.

Dahlia Sin - BOOT. For me the fit was not good. It looked tacky and messy to me on the runway. The color combination is not giving it and made the fabric something off.

Gigi Goode - TOOT. Its almost a Shoot but I’m looking for the bow. Its buttons and bows right? But this is fashion!

Heidi N Closet - TOOT. After having the worst runway on the premiere, this is a great look. Its relatable, fun and the girl served.

Jackie Cox - TOOT. Pre-season may comment to Jackie is I still don’t know her style/aesthetic. But after two episodes, she is really serving period fashion. Not fan o the combination of colors but I get the reference and it worked.

Jaida Essence Hall - TOOT. She really has the grace and poise. I’m just expecting a bit more since its Jaida but love the different shades of pink! Its very clean and sexy.

Jan - TOOT. This is my favorite, no explanation needed. I just wish she presented it fiercely other than sceaing on the runway but this is one of the perfect approach in the category.

Nicky Doll - TOOT. Love the Cinderella reference. It was unique. Love the whole idea and the button hair. The details was a well thought off.

Rock M Sakura - TOOT. Its Alice and its fun. I just wish that the hair was presented in a clearer way. Like its really well made and not just a bunch of hair with a bow. But overall I love that this is blue in color. Fresh in the eye.

Widow Von Du - TOOT. One of my faves. Its like a chocolate cake with a lot of candy toppings more on a clown. I just wish a cotton candy colored hair to complete the fantasy.

[Redacted] - TOOT. Kudos to the designer Florence D’ Lee because the colors worked for me. She also made Brita’s outfit but this one in particular is not the typical cutie look. Love the design if the fabric. Placement of bows and buttons. I wish the mug was different like more of a possesed doll.

Close, but I don't think (Chimera Ant arc) Kil could pull a victory against Palm... but that's the thing: I don't know.

thepinklavalamp,"I don’t think any of the remaining players are playing a bad game necessarily — certainly Adam has made the most mistakes. I don’t remember his gameplay during his original season super clearly but I think he plays well with his back up against the wall (then again, so does Ben and arguably much better). I’ll say Adam but I don’t think it will be so easy to get him out; he’s a slippery player. 

I might even go ahead and choose Nick. Loved him the first time around and I’m still rooting, and although he survived Tribal on the other episode, I don’t think he did much of anything to get Tyson out. It seems like he was gaffe-prone all throughout that episode. I also don’t think the (admittedly mostly innocent) confession to Parvati was necessarily smart. It’s fueling her “black widow” persona which she has always played to great effect. I can see him being manipulated/flipping on Yul and Wendell.

Speaking of, Wendell would probably be my 3rd choice. Extremely quiet game so far which is OK at this stage, but what’s up with his behavior around Parv and Michelle? I get that they dated but him being extremely awkward in the world’s most social game seems like, under these high stakes circumstances, enough of a reason for him to be the first target on that tribe.",fki210f,t3_fil18o,/r/survivor/comments/fil18o/which_one_player_do_you_think_is_playing_the/fki210f/,1,survivor,False,0,2020-03-14

KorgDTR2000,"&gt;Forget for a moment that the two are married and look at just gameplay.

I'm not going to do that, not even for a moment, because to look at it that way is disingenuous.

Amber did not manipulate Rob, Amber was Rob's girlfriend. She was not trying to trick him into taking her all the way to the end, she was falling in love with him.

Intention is everything. If Amber had turned around after the game and said ""Sorry Rob but it was just a game"" then she would be the biggest black widow in the show's history, one of the most cutthroat players ever, all of that.

GONheeZy,"&gt;I'm confused. Are you saying that making someone feel shock equals lethality? Or are you saying thunderbolt is lethal to a regular person, and not Ant Palm?

I'm saying Thunderbolt will be lethal to Palm

&gt;Okay, I think you're saying these attacks are lethal to someone. Yah I agree. However, Thunderbolt isn't lethal to Ant Palm is my rebuttal to what you claimed earlier


If you're saying a thunderbolt isn't lethal to Palm, then that is ludicrous. Though it could be vice versa, even so I can't tell.

&gt;You're making the assumption that Killua's claw can pierce Ant Palm's face or even her eye at all. Palm was reborn as a Chimera Ant, making her entire body generally far superior to a human's. Let's assume Kil can pierce Palm's eye with his sharp ass fingernails. That doesn't mean it's GG that quick lol. Characters don't lose an eye and just die all of a sudden; Pouf's clone made that clear enough 

Okay, so I'm going to ask you what piercing resistant feats does Palm have saying that Killua couldn't pierce her? Honestly, I don't see her being remotely as strong as Zazan who has legitimate piercing feats while Palm doesn't. Her eye is very well vulnerable to piercing, as nothing suggest she isn't. Feats are to be taken literal rather than pure assumption.

Pouf and Palm aren't the same, so how can you make such a vague comparison when one is based off cells and is a clone controlled from a far distance? Not to mention he had no organs, so it would make sense why Pouf can survive (a clone, not even his entire body) Furthermore do I believe Killua will oneshot Palm? No, certainly not in base but can he whittle her down? A thunderbolt will be troublesome and even destroy Palm from the inside. She hasn't shown being able to resist such shocks which can render Youpi paralyzed and its one thunderbolt. Now, of course the thunderbolt is *avoidable* but given Killua's far superior intellect he will pull through, feats show otherwise.

&gt;Where's the proof to support this claim? I don't recall seeing anything damage Ant Palm's Black Widow or even Ant Palm in general. You're scaling GS Killua to a character that has yet to take any damage. If she has been hurt before, tell me when because I don't recall.

This is similar to saying Palm can survive an attack from Pre-Rose Meruem because she hasn't shown to hurt?? The same argument you are making. Lets not forget Killua in Godspeed has far better feats than what Palm has shown to handle, we don't know how Palm would fair against Base Killua if he was fighting back, sure I get that however GS Killua puts him above many mid-tier hxh characters due to his versatility of abilities and his one downfall being the time limit of GS. The only thing we can give Palm is Meruem compliments Palm of her aura, not necessarily being freaking OP!!!! But being pleasant and having a soothing flow of aura like he has never seen before. Lots of resolve. 

So these are the main factors-

Can Palm withstand Killua's thunderbolts?

Can Palm resist piercing attacks?

Can Palm defeat Killua before Godspeed runs out?  

You can take this from two standpoints.

Feats &gt; Statements, that meaning Killua has better feats in GS therefore stomps Palm with zero difficulty and blitzes.

Or 

Due to Palm's better use in aura or experience per say can outlast GS Kil thus giving her the win. 

However, many problems with that. A bloodlusted Palm couldn't even oneshot a base Killua, but only break his defense. Killua was easily reacting to her numerous times without much effort or Killua just wasn't going at his all. 

Which leaves me to believe Godspeed Killua is far too fast and has a way to take out Palm with not much of an issue and that is using thunderbolt to his advantage.

&gt;In what world does beating a character equal being faster than?

Proofread what I said. You said she beat him *easily* I said no she didn't when they were clearly keeping up with speed and Killua not even fighting back. I wasn't just referencing speed. How exactly are you just nit-picking speed out of my words, it was to prove Palm never beat Killua, let alone damage him as if he was on the brink of death.",fkiyz1r,t3_fik6qe,/r/HunterXHunter/comments/fik6qe/killua_vs_palm/fkiyz1r/,1,HunterXHunter,True,0,2020-03-15

gunchar16,"&gt; And? No one made her let her guard down; she chose to. That speaks to her sense of awareness.

Alrighty, i guess Netero and Zeno are total weaklings without awareness for letting their guards down too XD...

&gt; So you believe Machi's threads &gt; Palm's Black Widow form? Explain.

I don't believe either until we get more feats for Machi.

&gt; Ant Palm defeated Killua with Black Widow (Kil didn't use GS, but I doubt it would do much in its short timeframe).

Aha, so what?

&gt; Machi's only real feats thus far include taking on Shadow Beasts alongside other Troupe members, and soloing a few fodder Mafia members.

Yeah, exactly.

&gt; Her threads have only been shown to heal well and puppeteer.

They are clearly also a weapon and are obviously made out of Nen dude...

&gt; Ant Palm seems a lot faster

Based on which comparison again?

&gt; and is definitely stronger than Machi since she broke Killua's (50kg) yo-yo.

From where exactly do you get that someone of the physically stronger half of the Spiders couldn't break a 50kg Yo-Yo?


&gt; Ftr, Kil is my fav character and Machi is my favorite girl character, so i promise there is no bias from me. Palm stomps.

Yeah right your other posts arent hidden you know, like especially this extra hot garbage here:

&gt; Feitan was the internim leader in Chrollo's absence and is implied to be the 2nd strongest of the Spiders (maybe Phinks or Nobunaga take that spot, but it's all relative).

&gt; Machi is implied to be strong amongst the spiders? Lol. In comparison to who? Kortopi? Seriously. Who else in the Phantom Troupe could Machi beat? Machi isn't very strong herself from what has been seen, which is why she focuses on healing and controlling others through nen. She's also pretty simple-minded for letting her guard down against an enemy of the Troupe (Hisoka)

Even putting freaking Nobu who has all-around worse feats than Machi, is physically weaker while being a goddamn Enhancer and has in general a terrible portrayal possibly at the second position, but then to honestly claim Machi could at best beat Kortopi XD... 

Your bias against Machi is so insanely plain to read it literally smells like bias, so tell your obvious lies your grandma(although let's hope she isn't actually senile enough to believe them). Oh and Feitan of course just became the internim leader of the Spiders after killing Zazan, but what else to expect from such an ""unbiased expert"" like you.",fkizi21,t3_fem46s,/r/HunterXHunter/comments/fem46s/ant_palm_vs_machi/fkizi21/,1,HunterXHunter,False,0,2020-03-15

webswinginghero,I’m sure Endgame would’ve been number 1 for the time being but definitely would’ve not made enough to beat Avatar (unless that’s what you mean). They surely would’ve delayed it but I think Black Widow will do alright. I honestly don’t think it will make 1 billion (tho I’m hoping it does) but it should at least make $900M-$1B. Hype definitely isn’t as high as Endgame but it does come here and then especially when the trailers and spots come out. I do agree with the sales because nobody knows when the next release date will be when it’s delayed since most people will also probably watch another movie instead and most likely won’t the have time/money if it is pushed back too far or close to other hyped up movies soon to be out within the coming months.

TideofWar,"In terms of the synergies, I think it's an amazing concept if they just implented it a lot more and make it diverse instead of just 4-6 characters. Example, instead of just x-men or bh, why not make it mutants to include deadpool, cable and namor. There are times where they work together OR make them weaker against each other. Like defenders are great against villains while S6 are great against city heroes. Martial artist is underutilized tag. Gamora and starlord to make gamora more usable. Deadpool with spidey, wolvie and especially captain america considering he respects over everyone. Daredevil, bullseye, kingpin and elektra/hand since he was their leader once. Black widow and hulk. The illuminati would be a nice tag too. Nebula, gamora, and thanos. Winter soldier and captain america. Ravagers and guardians. Mr. Sinister, cyclops and Jean grey. Crap, even cable, cyclops and Jean. Storm and black panther. Scarlet witch and magneto. Adding a WW2/Military tag for Captain america, wolvie, winter soldier, punisher, captain marvel etc. I'm sure I'm missing waaaaaay more examples.

Stevenstorm505,"Her sacrifice is the resolution of her arc. She’s been guilt ridden about the things she did in her past and looking for a way to make amends for that. Hawkeye had the ability to kill her but instead spared her life and brought her into shield, which began her path to self redemption which truly manifested itself when she became an Avenger which were, in her own words, her “family”. Which was then ripped away from her where she spent the next five years wanting nothing more than to bring them back. When that opportunity presented itself she made the choice to sacrifice herself instead of sacrificing Barton because she felt indebted to him for what his choice gave to her, he was her best friend and he had a wife and three children coming back if they succeeded which she also loved like family. I think any Black Widow fan that had perspective would be able to see that and understand and appreciate what Nat did and why she did it. It wasn’t a throwaway death, it was a death built on the path she chose to follow when she became a shield agent.

CarolJanNatWanda,"I think you’re being weird.

Why are you so upset about shows made by a separate company not tying into what Marvel Studios is doing with the MCU? That’s weird.

As for the Disney+ stuff: it’s giving classic characters time to shine in a real meaningful way that they’ve almost never gotten in comics, and it’s literally just $6 a month and all of the shows are 6-8 episode mini series. I don’t see how you’re crying about Netflix when all of those shows are 13 episodes and Netflix is double the price of Disney+ (also Marvel Studios didn’t make the Netflix shows so).

Also if you’re not excited about Black Widow’s movie because she’s dead... why not talk about it? Like... criticize Endgame for making the truly shitty decision that it did: killing Widow instead of Grumpy cat.

Takeaways:

1. Marvel Studios created the MCU. Period. The Marvel TV stuff was Ike Perlmutter’s misguided attempt to leech off the movie brand. You shouldn’t expect another company’s output to be included in the MCU.

2. The Cap and Iron Man franchises are over, but after 2020 we’re now going to be getting four movies and like five shows a year. That’s new MCU content basically all the time. I don’t see how you can be mad at that. It’s likely that most of it will be good. If you liked Guardians I don’t see how you can be against this new stuff. Marvel’s entire MO is to keep introducing new characters while (hopefully) continuing to evolve the existing ones.

3. I’m getting a strange feeling that you are kind of mad about diversity or whatever, but you literally have Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, and Thor all in 2021... plus there will be sequels to Guardians and Ant-Man in the next phase.",fkka7fw,t3_fj0d59,/r/marvelstudios/comments/fj0d59/no_confidence_in_disney_to_handle_the_legacy/fkka7fw/,1,marvelstudios,False,0,2020-03-15

Mnemosense,"Calling phase 1 to 3 a fluke is basically an insult to all the people who worked on those movies, especially Feige and the directors/writers he greenlit for each movie.  

There is a smidgen of truth in the idea that a good movie is made from luck, because movies are collaborative and require hundreds of people working together. The ideal is that they're working towards the director's vision, but the truth is that the director has to also work with the writer, the producers and the studio, and everyone has an idea of what they want in the movie. So yes, it's kind of lucky everytime we get a good movie, but it's not the whole truth.  

Feige is passionate about the Marvel IP, and he hires people who are equally passionate. He knows when to step in and lend a guiding hand, and he knows when to step back and let them do their thing.  

He's still around doing what he does, so there's zero reason for us to worry about the quality of content in phase 4. You don't want Disney+? You can always buy the inevitable blurays for the shows, no different than when you bought blurays for the movies. The complaint is akin to someone complaining about the existence of annuals, one shots and crossovers in comics. You don't have to buy them if you don't want to.  

Other complaints in the OP's original post can be dismissed. Disney+ will be the birth of TV shows canon to the movies, so you can ignore anything that's been released previously. And wondering why you should care about Black Widow post-death is like wondering why you should rewatch Iron Man 1 after his death.

Jebofkerbin,"Subversion is good when it's done right, but it can't be out of nowhere it needs to be at least somewhat hinted at, and make sense internally

An example for doing it horribly is game of thrones. Throughout the entire series it's hinted that Jon snow is the Prince that was promised, destined to save the world. There are prophecies that make John fit, subtle hints throughout the books, and some characters straight up decree that they think it's him. In the end though arya kills the night king, completely out of nowhere, with no real explanation or build up. And the fan reaction spoke for itself really

An example of subversion being done really bloody well on the other hand is game of thrones. Throughout the second and third season Robb stark follows the avenging son trope, fighting against a superior foe to avenge the death of his father. Things take a turn for the worse, and Robb plans a desperate military gambit that will win him the war if it works. However before he can do it, he is betrayed by walder frey at the red wedding and killed. 

If you aren't paying a huge amount of attention this comes out of nowhere, but when you think back on it it makes perfect sense. Walder Grey was known to be unreliable, and Robb had already slighted him, and Robb makes the mistake of assuming his vital support. At the same time during the wedding subtle hints are given that something is wrong throughout, especially in the books. The bride can't stop crying during the bedding ceremony, the Freys aren't drinking, the signature song of the starks sworn enemy starts playing.

The whole sequence is surprising, but it all makes internal sense and could have been predicted beforehand if you knew what to look for.

In endgame Black widow could have lifted the hammer, and it could have been awesome, but only if the legwork had been done in previous movies to subtly set it up. Subversion has to be set up beforehand otherwise it just feels cheap.",fklf3s5,t3_fj4mxw,/r/changemyview/comments/fj4mxw/cmv_black_widow_and_captain_america_should_have/fklf3s5/,1,changemyview,False,0,2020-03-15

Ravenamore,"From what I gather, the widow was completely innocent and didn't know of the financial black hole they were in until he died. 

He'd told her that me and my husband had been deep, dear friends, we'd never had any problems, and he was confused and hurt that we didn't contact him. In reality, he was an awful landlord who tried to stick us with repair bills, illegally video and audio recording us, refused to do repairs properly, used my husband and our friends as free, uncompensated labor, lost his shit when we handed him a bill for all the time he'd taken away from my husband's programming job, threatened us, threatened the Housing Authority. 

She knew NONE of that, just like we didn't know about his bullshit until after we signed the lease. 

He'd didn't just screw her over - he had a 14 year old daughter from a previous marriage, who, it turns out, he used to hide assets from the bankruptcy court.

RocketTasker,"- Iron Man - Using the Infinity Stones to permanently end the threat of Thanos.  If you need a feat the hero lived through, drawing blood from Thanos or stabilizing time travel.

- War Machine - Lifting and dropping a tank on a general’s doorstep, or fighting Extremis soldiers outside his armor.

- Hulk - Snapping the Gauntlet to undo Thanos’ 50% population wipe, and surviving the task.

- Black Widow - Jumping onto a Chitauri chariot without ripping her arms off, maybe her new skydiving feat will beat that when we see it.

- Thor - Tanking a focused neutron star while it forges Stormbreaker.

- Hawkeye - Bamboozling Loki with an exploding arrow.  Or hitting another chariot earlier without looking.

- Captain America - Wielding Mjolnir in a 1v1 against Thanos, and keeping his resolve when it looked like he was fighting an entire army alone.

- Winter Soldier - Pinning a bloodlusted Iron Man and digging into his chest plate with his metal hand.

- Falcon - Impressing Steve Rogers enough to become his successor.

- Star-Lord - Beating Ego with matching powers while Ego had millions more years of practice.

- Gamora - Hanging onto Drax’s line while the Milano was making a crash landing.

- Drax - Surviving on said line getting hit by several trees and ship pieces relatively unscathed.

- Rocket - Building a planet-busting bomb with spare parts.

- Groot - Grabbing the still-hot pieces of Stormbreaker to make its handle.

- Yondu - Wipes out an entire ship of mutinying Ravagers with his new fin.

- Nebula - Crashes a fighter into Thanos at full speed and emerges unscathed.

- Scarlet Witch - Destroying the Mind Stone while holding back Thanos who had the other five Infinity Stones.

- Quicksilver - Punching apart a dozen Ultron sentries in a split second with his bare hands.

- Vision - Burning Ultron out of the Internet.

- Ant-Man - Growing giant and punching a Chitauri leviathan out of the sky.

- Wasp - Knocking down Thanos with Rescue and Shuri.

- Black Panther - Knocking Cull Obsidian off his feet.

- Spider-Man - Defeating killer drones in a hallway with his eyes closed, and catching an invisible Mysterio’s attempt to shoot him in the head at the last second.

- Doctor Strange - Views and remembers 14 million possible outcomes to coordinate events and heroes to the one victorious scenario.

- Wong - Slices off Cull Obsidian’s hand with a sling ring.

- Mantis - Subdues Thanos with her powers (wasn’t her fault he got woken up).

- Valkyrie - Slices into a Chitauri leviathan  to kill it (for reference, Iron Man Mk VII would lose power before breaking its armor).

- Okoye - One-shots Corvus Glaive.
