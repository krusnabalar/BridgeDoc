Fabulous_Hooligan,"1. Enchantress isn't a major character in the DCU, she was a member of the 80's version of the Suicide Squad which explains her inclusion in the film. More recently she was the villain in Justice League Dark back in 2011 but hasn't been seen since.

2. Anti-Hero is as you said, a force for ""good"" but with non-traditional heroic character traits and/or methods. A lot of popular villains will sometimes be written as anti-heroes as its easier to tell stories with. DC has a lot of popular villains so many of them get depicted as anti-heroes from time to time.",cz4errf,t3_41pvc2,,8,movies,,,2016-01-19
baroqueworks,"Enchantress - kinda sorta, Enchantress always takes the same form though so she's pretty much living in June Moon's body, and swaps out whenever she shows up. Take out the Dark Phoenix's cosmic and replace it with Enchantress's mystical properties and you've got a similar idea, though DP is much more chaotic and apocalyptic.

With Deadshot, he originally was just a straight up bad guy not too much different then Bullseye on the Marvel side as a ace marksman and assassin. Starting with Suicide Squad and into Secret Six, he got way more characterization and humanized sides, making him more sympathetic but still a cold killer. Most of the time Suicide Squad is more villains  being reluctant heroes than anti-heroes, but there are few here and there. Amanda Waller herself swings back and forth from being a good to bad.",cz4brzg,t3_41pvc2,,7,movies,,,2016-01-19

Because they have no weapons or armor, and because in ALB you always had one transport for every squad, you have so many of them with no purpose other than suicide scouting.

But if your deck contains 1000 troops and only 50 trucks, then instead of sending suicide trucks, you should be trying to keep your trucks alive so you can keep using them. Destroying the enemy's trucks shuts down their transportation capabilities.",cz3fc2i,t3_41iqbe,,3,wargame,,,2016-01-19

robschwab,"It's just my opinion, I don't think it's gospel, and I do believe the films that were nominated and the actors nominated for their roles could be awarded (Golden Globe). Just not an Academy Award.

When I think Oscars, I think of emotional journeys, things never seen before, and an overall compelling story. 

I've mentioned Matt Damon for  Best Actor. Great movie, great actor. Captivating and likable. To me, it wasn't a great acting performance. To me, it felt like Matt Damon being Matt Damon... on Mars. There's nothing particularly special or great.

Christian Bale in The Big Short for Supporting Actor. I just don't see a journey for his character and once again, to me, it feels like he is just playing himself. His performance here is equal to his acting in Exodus. It's Christian Bale, he doesn't phone it in. But what about his character is break through? It's a bit part to get the ball rolling and we check in every now and then. It's just not up to par.

I feel like Leonardo Dicaprio Best Actor could be interchangeable with Michael B Jordan. To me, they both have a few great scenes that shine, and both movies are fantastic (Revenant should be in Best Picture and Cinematography). Only difference is, Creed has a roller coaster story, you can feel the emotion at different points and the character is fleshed out and layered. Revenant throws you in at the beginning with some crippling emotion but falters until the end and even that is short lived. It's like an hour and a half of Leo with a beard, wearing furs, talking funny, just walking around the forest. (I mean I know its not but it sure feels like it). That characters emotional journey peaks 30 minutes into the film.

Fassbender's performance was great but I can't agree it is top 5. It's rather bland without a lot of insight or rational changes shown. Meanwhile you have Seth Rogan sharing the screen as Woz and blowing it away with fiery emotion and a path. 

Jennifer Lawrence and Joy as a whole isn't that great of a movie. Lawrence is too young and immature to portray a maternal leader of the family and it fell short. Like my other qualms with Leo and Damon, it felt like JLaw was just JLaw. Quick emotional changes with the character(s) without rationing or explanation and even quicker turn around to make the audience feel good.

The roles played by those I mentioned rival or beat, in my opinion, many of those nominated, specifically those I mentioned, based on what **I** am looking for in an Academy Award winning film.

Michael B Jordan/Will Smith could easily take on Damon/Dicaprio/Fassbender with their superb performances. ( I think WB told Smith they would get him the Oscar nom if he did Suicide Squad). Smith's portrayal was better than in Pursuit of Happiness. He showed so much compassion and emotion, not just in certain scenes (cough Dicaprio) but throughout the entire picture. It was like watching a documentary, I no longer saw just Will Smith acting.

Idris Elba or Samuel L Jackson (Walton Goggins too) could easily replace Christian Bale. If Elba was eligible, it would be a clear choice. Jackson vs Bale could be a battle, but there is more screen time and a longer character arc for Jackson. Having a much larger impact on the viewer and the film.

Aside from just those, the guys from Straight Outta Compton all did amazing jobs. It's a period piece, it's a social equality piece, it's an autobiography. There's a lot to think about watching that film and damn if I didn't get the feels.",cz43n2g,t3_41ogl0,,2,movies,,,2016-01-19

FeareSe7en,I'm worried about Zack Snyder being at the helm of our flagship though. BvS is the start of something new. Zack Snyder is an amazing director visually but storytelling wise very subpar. I'm afraid about BvS being bad as it has a lot of potential to be. Suicide Squad looks dope though Will Smith might be a hit or miss. I hope Flash and Shazam and the next Superman movies are happier and lighter. It seems that they might be getting too dark.,cz4iq47,t3_41pail,,2,movies,,,2016-01-19

Being joined by my good friend Greg Kirby we go through the coming year and chat about our most anticipated (and least anticipated) films coming out including Deadpool, Civil War, Batman VS Superman, Suicide Squad, and an upcoming Underworld sequel that exists for some reason.

Yes, I know Jada Pinkett's argument was aimed at the larger black acting community as a whole; but take the fight to the directors and casting agencies for not HIRING quality black actors / actresses in predominant roles.

Just because Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique is one of the three, arguably, main characters (the other two being Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy) does not mean the movies are about her.

HollandGW215,"Really?


I thought it was such a bullshit answer. Like first off, Django was a revenge story not a love story. Second, the fact that he had to plug in African American story rubbed me the wrong way. Quintin Tarantino is probably one of the biggest advocates of African American characters in film and Smith is making it seem like he is not doing the ethnicity justice.


Lastly, felt like an odd answer to me because Smith has a history of during down roles. Like he turned down Matrix because he did not understand it. That is a reason I could get behind. But when a man says he opposes violence when he just wrapped up filming a movie called ""Suicide Squad"" playing a character named DEADSHOT, felt a bit flat. 



I would have respected him more if he said he just didn't want to do it. Didn't feel he would click with Tarantino or did not get it. Jaime Foxx was good in the role, but to be honest he was forgettable. Waltz, Jackson, and DiCaprio all stole the show - Foxx just showed up. I would have loved to have seen Smith play Django because it would have made the character that much more alive and interesting to watch/root for. ",cz3x85n,t3_41m3js,,-2,movies,,,2016-01-19

lordderplythethird,"Suicide Squad is a anti-hero group in the DC universe. Essentially, the military recruits a bunch of locked up villains, and sends them on super dangerous missions, under the code name Suicide Squad, because if they die, oh well.

Members of Suicide Squad change out frequently in the comics, depending on who's locked up/dead/etc, but for this particular movie, it's:

* Deadshot

* Harley Quinn

* Rick Flag

* Boomerang

* El Diablo

* Killer Croc

* Enchantress

* Katana

It's also had (in the comics) people such as:

* Poison Ivy

* Penguin

* Superboy

* Solomon Grundy

* Hawkman

Basically, it's just a bunch of locked up villains, or people blackmailed by the government to serve them, for use as a deniable force (if they die or get caught, who's going to believe these villains were working for the government?).

And yes, that was Joker. It's supposed to be a psychopath based off real life Mexican Cartel drug lords, as opposed to say, the anarchist of the Dark Knight series

HoundOfJustice,"Anyone who's still a bit unclear, the suicide squad is basically USA's metahuman hit crew made up of B, C and D-lister supervillains with the occassional anti-hero or A-lister villain mixed in. Primarily used to do America's dirty work, this roster features:

Suicide Squad staples, **Deadshot and Captain Boomerang**. Deadshot is proclaimed to be THE greatest shot in the world, outaiming Deathstroke on more than one occasion. Captain Boomerang throws boomerangs. Deadly boomerangs. Throws them well. Also a scumbag.

**Diablo**, repentant gang member that manifests flames from his tattoos. Had a strong run with Suicide Squad 2011 to 2014, was a heavy hitter when enraged.

**Killer Croc**, batman rogue. Seems to be the King Shark analogue, most likely plays the brick tank role.

**Harley Quinn**, Miss Joker herself. Insane woman with insane impressive hand to hand skills as well as marksmanship skills. Also fan-service.

**Enchantress** isn't someone I'm familiar with, but appeared in the Suicide Squad's 1980 incarnation. Magical role, not much information on her.

**Slipknot** is a D-lister, so surprising for him to be here honestly instead of Bronze Tiger or Black Manta.  Proficient in ropes to hang and choke.

**Rick Flag** led most Suicide Squads in the field, military officer that took no shit. Anti-hero.

**Katana** is an interesting choice. A hero that normally rolls with Batman and the outsiders, it seems she's here on volunteer duty, using her Soultaker sword -yes, it takes souls of the people she kills- to great effect.

Probably missing one or two, might need to go back and look closely. All in all, weird roster to be honest. Would've expected Bronze Tiger, King Shark, Vertigo, and others. But interesting to be sure. Excited to see this movie

Real-Terminal,"I don't understand any of your criticisms, stupid isn't a legitimate criticism, everything is stupid, Harry Potter swinging a little stick and saying made up words is stupid, stupid isn't a credible complaint.

Edgy doesn't make sense, ""edgy"" has never made sense to me as a complaint, I don't see how the term is applicable to this trailer, what do you mean by edgy? Harley sipping tea in prison could be explained extremely easily, especially in the context of the universe and her character, the dialogue shown in the trailer is just one liners and exposition pulled out of context, it makes no sense to pick it apart, and are likely to be different in the final film anyway.

As for the Suicide Squad, they're essentially the DC version of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and they look way more ridiculous in their comic forms. They're a group of high and low profile Batman villains thrown together to sell some new comics, most of which are insane of psychopathic.

If the movie seems so stupid and edgy, it's doing it's job, because that's pretty much what the characters are, and the characters are gonna be downplayed compared to their comic forms too, Harley should be wearing shiny red and black tights and wield a big hammer like it's nothing.

The movie will be a light hearted action romp with a dark core that DC does well. Except because Batman isn't here, it's gonna be less serious. I'm sorry if I come off as offensive in any way, I just find most of the negativity I've seen pretty pointless from my point of view. ",cz51qjr,t3_41sbrc,,28,movies,,,2016-01-20

[deleted],"I think $300M is way too high. 

1. $300M is a *lot* of money. The only comic-book movies to *ever* make that much money have either had: (A) Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man, (B) Christian Bale's Batman, (C) RDJ's Iron Man, or (D) Groot. That's a pretty short list, man. Superman? Nope. X-Men? Nope, none of 'em, solo or in a group. Captain America? Not even close. Thor? A hundred million dollars short of that. Even Disney's Big Hero Six doesn't come close.

2. Who the heck is in it? Joker aside, none of these characters are remotely popular among the general public--and Leto doesn't really look like the Joker. He looks more like a kid you might buy pills from at a festival, or that you might see hanging out in a shopping mall food court. I get that the crazy/hot one is supposed to be Harley Quinn, I guess, but, again, by appearances that's a girl who'd be off her face at a festival, more than an instantly recognizable comic-book icon. And the rest of 'em? Literally no idea.

3. There are *so many* bizarre characters that the film's completely overloaded. Yes, nobody knew who the Guardians of the Galaxy are, but the trailers made it very clear: you got your five-man band all good to go. There's the face, there's the chick, there's the muscle, there's the crazy hothead, there's the comic relief, now let's have some fun '70s space adventures.  Suicide Squad, though? Man. They're throwing so many characters at us at once that the trailers aren't even bothering to introduce most of them. There's guy with a gun, and other guy with a gun, and guy with a trenchcoat and maybe a gun, and magic girl, and other girl who is maybe magic but has a sword, and another guy with a gun, and Will Smith with a gun, and guy with tattoos and a gun, and ugly guy, and there's Joker and Harley and they're going to be good guys even though they're bad because the government wants them to but I guess they'll end up turning against the government or maybe not who knows, and maybe it'll be a caper action-comedy ^(but there seems to be a lot of torture and stuff so maybe not) 

4. This movie feels pretty narrowly targeted at under-25s. And while it's PG-13, it doesn't really look like it'll be drawing that many under-16s, either; it seems a bit creepy/dark and pubescently sexual for family audiences. We've got torture and kinky fetish gear to keep away the kids, and we've got a highschool-goth atmosphere to keep away the grownups.


5. I really don't think this movie will have much international appeal. Movies with strong international appeal tend to be all-ages-friendly (no), have a clear and understandable concept (no), have a handful of easily described characters (no), and broad humor rather than humor rooted in specific cultural expectations or references (probably not). 
 
6. DC hasn't really had much success with bringing their deeper catalogue to the big screen. Their highest-grossing non-Batman/non-Superman movie is *Green Lantern* with $117M. Then comes *Watchmen* with $108M. And we've got *V for Vendetta* with $70M. And we've also got Jonah Hex in there with $10M. 

Assuming it isn't a very good movie, I'm thinking $150M domestic, and maybe another $250M international. On the other hand, I'm also thinking it could very well become *really* popular among its teenaged target audience. Not broad support, but deep, maybe. Something to build on.

BvS, though...that isn't looking good. I hope Zack Snyder doesn't end up Zack-Snydering the hell out of it, but it sure looks like he's about to.",cz5t8it,t3_41vtk7,,19,boxoffice,,,2016-01-20

VioletJane,"To be fair, the Suicide Squad in the comics has been very much like this and Guardians of the Galaxy were not. GotG became more like this recently, but Suicide Squad had comedy violence going on for a long time. Their first run didn't dive as much into the comedy field at first, though the later issues definitely had some real dark humor. The newer issues starting in the early 2000's started to bring more comedy elements to it. I think the trailer gave a good mix between their life in Belle Reve and their chance to be free and run amok. 

*Edit: I'm not saying that the GotG weren't comedy gold for a long time, but I think there is a real difference between the two. GotG had zany space antics, while SS had clever, dark ways of killing someone.",cz4v48a,t3_41se6u,,17,videos,,,2016-01-20
lordderplythethird,"depends on the comic and stuff like that. 

In the TV show Arrow, Green Arrow was blackmailed by Amanda Waller (agent in charge of Suicide Squad) into serving as a member, otherwise she'd have his family killed. In the same show, she told Deadshot that if he joined, she'd make sure his child was taken care of (he was in jail at the time). Things like that mostly.

That TV show actually did a really damn good job of showcasing Suicide Squad now that I think about it. ",cz4znxy,t3_41se6u,,17,videos,,,2016-01-20

Dorkside,"&gt; none of these characters are remotely popular among the general public

You could have said the exact same about Guardians of the Galaxy, only Suicide Squad does have the Joker who is a culturally iconic character. Harley Quinn and Deadshot may not be household names but I still think they are way more well-known than any of the Guardians were before the movie. 

And Will Smith's box office draw may not be what it once was but I still think there's a large audience who will welcome him back into a big budget popcorn flick that isn't directed by M. Night Shyamalan and doesn't star his son.",cz5uhis,t3_41vtk7,,10,boxoffice,,,2016-01-20

I think that the Joker is SORT OF the main villain in this, but only accidentally.  Going off of the CC trailer's music (assuming that they're going this deep with it), with the first line being ""I started a joke that set the whole world crying"" or something along those lines.  We know the Joker does some pretty sadistic jokes, and we have seen him walking through some kind of factory either chemical or mechanical, so what if he thought it was funny to either create/wakeup/unleash something so terrible that they were forced to form the Suicide Squad to either: capture the Joker and try to force/coerce him into helping take down this big bad (which explains Harley's involvement, using a past association with the Joker to get him to comply) OR just to take down the big bad and fight the Joker at the same time.

As to what form this big bad can take: I have no clue.

Those lyrics were kind of spot on for this movie ""is this real life, is this a fantasy"" and the ""nothing really matters to me"" because they are bizzare, and inhuman and they are the suicide squad being sent into almost certain death.

OberonKingofFairies,"Comparing the Guardians' criminal status to that of SS, is a bit like comparing the loud jerk who picked on people in high school but ended up a cop (although still just as rude), to Kilgrave. Sure, it is true that the Guardians are jerks, and technically criminals; but the Suicide Squad is kind of out of their leauge in both regards, and a very, *very* different group.

Hydroel,"Good idea. However, I doubt these will stuck, they seem pretty lazy to me. I mean, the *Cyborg* one is just **Cyborg** written in caps, with a big bright red O, Hal 911 style. The Flash one has been around for a while, they just wrote **The Flash** in large in front of it. And I'm not even mentioning Aquaman's... His logo is basically an A, and they didn't use that ? Come on. Besides, the choice of sizes for the GLC one is weird, though. They seem to be insisting on the ""Corps"" part, since it's in the title, but not as much as in the [comics logo](http://thegreenlanterncorps.com/intro.jpg), where the **Corps** is bigger than the **Green Lantern**. And I like the idea of having a lantern as the *O* of **Corps**, I'm hope they'll do that in a later version.

I think these are only derivatives of the New 52 logos, just like the first Suicide Squad logo was ([first movie logo](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/markhughes/files/2015/03/Suicide-Squad-logo-1.png) vs [New 52 logo](http://cdn.movieweb.com/img.news.tops/NEKG6jtEojXfNS_4_b.jpg)). Given the metal look of the first 4 logos, I think they'll keep something in that style.",cz56qsc,t3_41tjj4,,5,DC_Cinematic,,,2016-01-20
iOnlySawTokyoDrift,"I know I'm late, but I've been collecting these movies since they started with Doomsday and I'm always willing to talk about them.

IMO the top 10 DCUAOM are, in no particular order:

1. The Dark Knight Returns - One of the most important DC stories of all time turned into one of their best animated movies ever; original released as 2 movies, later releases would combine them into a complete edition (if you wanted longer movies, this one is the winner)

2. Batman: Under the Red Hood - based on the Death in the Family and Under the Hood stories of Batman; this movie is single-handedly the reason people love Red Hood instead of hating Jason Todd

3. Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox - a terrific adaptation of Flashpoint, the DC event that launched the New 52; the art's weird, but the movie rocks and helped start the bloodier violence seen in the newer movies

4. Justice League: Gods &amp; Monsters - Bruce Timm presents an original retelling of the DC Universe, in which ""Superman"" is Zod's son instead of Jor-El's, ""Batman"" is a vampiric Kirk Langstrom (Man-Bat in the regular universe), and ""Wonder Woman"" is a New God instead of an Olympian; some people hated this because they didn't know what they were getting into, but it's definitely one of DC's best

5. Wonder Woman - Wonder Woman's origin story, an awesome bloodbath of an adventure featuring Ares as the main villain; generally considered one of the best

6. Superman vs The Elite - based on the story ""What's So Funny about Truth, Justice, and the American Way?"", Superman confronts a new group of young publicly-beloved vigilantes who are willing to kill their enemies, becoming as much of a moral and existential adventure as it is action-packed (if you want to see Superman really cut loose, this is your movie)

7. Justice League: The New Frontier - based on the comic of the same name, this is the Justice League's formation during the 1950s rather than modern day, and while less action-y than others on this list, it has a great story

8. All-Star Superman - a condensed retelling of the comic series of the same name, this incredibly bizarre, sometimes rushed, but all-around enjoyable story shows what Superman would do for his ""bucket list"", having only few months left to live

9. Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths - originally written as a bridge between Justice League The Animated Series and Justice League Unlimited, this story was later reworked into an original movie which shows the League going up against their evil Earth 3 counterparts, the Crime Syndicate

10. Justice League: War - a controversial pick, this is pretty much a page-for-page retelling of the Justice League's New 52 origin, only with Aquaman replaced by Shazam; it's pretty much mindless violence in a battle against Darkseid, but hey, it's awesome

Honorable Mentions:

- Batman: Year One is the animated version of the the comic of the same name, which has become the definitive origin story for Batman; Bryan Cranston as Jim Gordon is the real star of the show and does a great job, but it doesn't hit my top 10 due to a poorly-voiced Batman (coincidentally played by Ben McKenzie, who is now Gordon in the Gotham TV show) as well as the fact that *Batman Begins* was already a more entertaining version of the story (albeit less accurate and mixed with elements of *The Long Halloween*)

- Batman: Assault on Arkham takes place in the *Batman: Arkham* video game universe, after *Origins* but before *Asylum*, but despite the name it's actually a Suicide Squad movie that just happens to feature Batman; if you want a potential preview of the Squad before the live-action film hits theaters in August, this animated heist movie is a guilty pleasure of mine and tons of fun

- Batman: Gotham Knight is a weird *anime anthology* that takes place after *Batman Begins*, similarly to the Animatrix or Halo Legends; not everyone likes it, but imo it's worth watching for the experience

Don't Watch:

- Green Lantern: First Flight is a retelling of GL's origin story, but sadly it's a really bad one

- Son of Batman and Batman vs Robin have some great action, but dialog is cringe-inducing and they butcher some great comic book stories (the third movie in the Damien series, Batman: Bad Blood, is supposedly much better, but I won't be able to watch that until tomorrow at the earliest)

- Superman: Doomsday adapts the famous ""Death of Superman"" storyline, but does so with mediocrity (not that the original story is really that well put-together in hindsight); it was the first DCUAOM, though, so they were still getting their footing",cz5st93,t3_41twgk,,5,DCcomics,,,2016-01-20
Tommosahn,"It's actually pretty simple to get everyone, (even the crew), to survive the suicide mission, minus 1 I believe. You must get all the offensive/defensive ship upgrades, (guns, shields, armor), and complete everyone's loyalty mission. However, these must be done very carefully, as after you get the IFF from the Reaper, you'll either cause everyone to be kidnapped right away, or, if there's any loyalty missions left, you'll get 2 more missions before they get taken. SO, complete everyone's loyalty mission except 1 of your choosing, and right after getting legion, do the remaining loyalty mission, then Legions. After that, everyone gets kidnapped. Here's where the matter of the crew comes in; the more you fuck around (do missions and such), after they get kidnapped. If you go right after they get kidnapped, they'll all survive. If you do a couple missions, some will, some won't, etc. So, go right after they get kidnapped, then as long as you have all of the upgrades no one dies during the initial leap through the relay, and the fight with the Collector ship. After you crash land, you must use the right people for the teams to keep everyone alive; Garrus/Miranda for secondary team leader, Tali, Legion, or Kasumi for the Tech Specialist, Samara or Jack for the Biotic, and after you've rescued the crew, you'll want Mordin as their escort back, due to the fact that as long as the person you picked is Loyal to you, they'll survive no matter what. After all that, leave at least 2 out of these three following characters, Zaeed, Garrus, or Grunt, behind to fight off the Collectors while you fight the final boss, as they are the most powerful, and as long as at least 2 are there, along with everyone being Loyal, the ""Number's Check"" that the game does to calculate who all survives will always be high enough that everyone lives. The reason you want Mordin to escort everyone back is that he's the ""weakest"" character, so if you send someone ""stronger"" than him, there's a lower chance of everyone surviving. If you do all of that, then it will be a guaranteed successful Suicide Mission. (Note, without the ship upgrades, at least 2, if not 3 of your squad will die before even reaching the Collector Base, Jack, Tali, and possibly one other person).

Nevertheless, I've been working diligently on this picture for 22 months and yes, I'm quite excited about its release! Your words ring a special bell in my ear. Until this point, 22 months into production, nary once had I considered recasting a portion of a movie because one of our stars had an opinion about something completely unrelated to our film! But, my friend, you have truly awoken me to the reality of the situation, and yes; we will recast Deadshot, reshoot 17% of the movie (including rebuilding every set and scene exactly as original). There's just no way we can release this film knowing that Mr. Smith had feelings about something, that someone didn't like!

I've already contacted David Ayer and he's onboard. Wish us luck, and please PLEASE message me if you have more ideas how we can save this doomed production! Oh, and we've already recast Deadshot with Tom Cruise. You're welcome!

RedBarrel,"Very hard to say. Deadpool and Suicide Squad both look like very fresh comic book movies, but BvS, Apocalypse, and Civil War could all range from great to disappointing. I'm personally looking forward to Civil War and Doctor Strange the most as a pair. Winter Soldier has the same directors and I think writers as Civil War, and that was my favorite Marvel movie. I just like Strange.

Despite the underwhelming trailers, Singer has never made an X-Men movie I didn't thoroughly enjoy. Deadpool will rely on its comedy and violence - we'll see how that works out.

Suicide Squad looks like a great time at the movies. BvS is kickstarting the next giant cinematic universe.

alarmsoundslikewhoop,"Captain America: Winter Soldier is my favorite super hero movie, so for me it's all about Marvel this year. The same writers, the same directors, and (mostly) the same cast makes Civil War a hugely anticipated movie for me. Great movies have had bad sequels, sure, but I'm feeling like they can pull this one off. Dr. Strange could be great or it could be just okay, but it almost doesn't matter to me because we're getting a new Captain America movie this year and that's awesome.

I wasn't a Man of Steel fan, so it's hard for me to be hyped about DC's new cinematic universe since that's the only entry so far. But I'm going to see every new super hero movie regardless of quality, so I'm really hoping their movies will be great. I don't watch trailers but my friends tell me Suicide Squad looks awesome. 

I'm hopeful for Deadpool, but have never been a big fan of the comic. Less hopeful for Apocalypse. I appreciate what Bryan Singer did with the first X-Men, and that it kicked off our modern era of super hero movies, but I don't think he's the best custodian for this property. I don't particularly like X2 or Days of Future Past (or Superman Returns), so I'm not expecting much from Apocalypse.

mrplow8,"It was rumored to be Enchantress a while back. I kind of think it might be Joker too. It doesn't seem like Joker is a member of the team from the trailers, and we don't know what his role is yet. So he could be the villain. 

Here's my theory: Both Enchantress and Joker are the villains. Enchantress is the one that the Suicide Squad is formed to stop, but, along the way, Joker somehow gets involved with his own plan that the Squad also has to stop.

espher,"Thank you so much. It’s so great to be here in /r/EmeraldPS2. We’re here just thawing out. clone2204 and I and a couple of our friends here from 1TR, lending our support for the next server rep of our great Emerald, Crossjon.


Crossjon, you’re right, look back there in the moderation box. Heads are spinning, moderator heads are spinning. This is going to be so much fun.


Are you ready to make Emerald great again? We all have a part in this. We all have a responsibility. Looking around at all of you; you hard-working /r/EmeraldPS2 posters, you farmer outfits and zergers and skyknights and squad leaders and Scrinrushers; you vehicle shitters and MAX shitters! All of you who work so hard, you full-time platoon leaders, you with the hands that rock the cradle. You all make the world go round and now our cause is one.


When asked why I would jump into a shitpost — kind of stirring it up a little bit maybe — and choose one over some friends who are running and I’ve endorsed a couple others in their races before they decided to run for server rep I was told left and right, 'you are going to get so clobbered in the press. You are just going to get beat up and chewed up and spit out.'


You know, I’m thinking, 'and?’


You know, like Miller hasn’t tried to do that every day since that ServerSmash in ‘15, when I was on Reddit posting that we were the best, and I got to say, 'yeah, I’ll go, send me, you betcha. I’ll serve.'


And, like you all, I’m still standing. So those of us who’ve kind of gone through the ringer as Crossjon has, makes me respect you even more. That you’re here, and you’re putting your efforts and you’re putting reputations, you’re putting relationships on the line to do the right thing for this server. Because you are ready to make Emerald great again.


Well, I am here because like you, I know that it is now or never.


I’m in it to win it because we believe in Emerald and we love our bushido. And if you love your bushido, thank a dolphin. Thank a dolphin and know that the Emerald community deserves a server rep that loves our server passionately and will never apologize for this server. A new server rep who will never leave our llama behind. A new server rep, one who will never lie to the members of the Illuminati.


I’m in it, because just last year, we’re watching our infantrymans suffer and be humiliated on a world stage at the hands of Miller and SgtMile in violation of honorabu coinflip bushido, because a weak-kneed, server rep has decided Emerald will lead from behind. And he, who would negotiate deals, kind of with the skills of a community organizer maybe organizing a neighborhood tea, well, he deciding that, 'No, Emerald would allow it' and as part of the deal, as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the servers that they cheat and we kowtow and we apologize, and then, we bend over and say, 'Thank you, Miller.'


We are ready for a change. We are ready and our infantrymans deserve the best. A new server rep whose track record of success has proven he is the master at the art of the deal. He is one who would know to negotiate.


Only one candidate’s record of success proves he is the master of the art of the deal. He is beholden to no one but we the people. How refreshing. He is perfectly positioned to let you make Emrald great again. Are you ready for that, /r/Planetside?


No more pussy footin’ around! Our infantrymans deserve the best. You deserve the best.


He is from the mid-tier, not a zergling, can I get a 'Get on the bus!'


Where, in the mid-tier, you actually have to balance platoon composition in order to prioritize — to keep the main thing, the main thing — and he knows the main thing. A server rep is to keep us leet meme-wise and ServerSmash-wise. He knows the main thing, and he knows how to lead the charge. So infantrymans, hang in there, because help’s on the way because he, better than anyone, isn’t he known for being able to command, fire!


Are you ready for a server rep... you ready for a server rep who will let our leetfits do their job and go kick INI's ass?


Ready for someone who will secure our points, to secure our fights and to secure our meta? Ready to make Emerald great again, are you ready to +1 for Crossjon? I’m here to support the next server rep of Emerald, Crossjon.


Now, eight years ago, I warned Cintesis' promised fundamental transformation of Emerald. That is was going to take more from you and leave Emerald weaker on the world stage and that we would soon be unrecognizable. Well, it’s the one promise that Cintesis kept. But he didn’t do it alone and this is important to remember, especially those of you, like DocTina, a member of PSB. This is what we have to remember in this very contested, competitive, great server rep race.


Crossjon's candidacy. It has exposed not just that tragic the ramifications of that betrayal of the transformation of our server, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the ocean that has enabled it, OK?


Well, Crossjon, what he’s been able to do, which is really ticking people off, which I’m glad about, he’s going rogue left and right, man. That’s why he’s doing so well. He’s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the Illuminati. The way that the Illuminati really works and please hear me on this. I want you guys to understand more and more how the Illuminati, the establishment, works and has gotten us into the troubles that we are in — in Emerald.


The permanent ServerSmash class has been doing the bidding of their KDR infantry class and that’s why you see that the lattices are kept open. For them, for their zergfit labour that they want to come in. That’s why they’ve been padding stats. It’s for stat padding shitters to be able to suck off of them. It’s why we see these lousy pushes that gut our platoons for shitty farms elsewhere.


We need someone new, who has the power, and is in the position to bust up that Illuminati. To make things great again. It’s part of the problem.


His candidacy, which is a movement. It’s a force. It’s a strategy. It proves, as long as the posters, they get to keep their post titles and their flairs and their updoots. They don’t really care who wins ServerSmash.


Believe me on this. And the proof of this? Look what’s happening today. Our own zergfit machine, the shitters, they who would want to assemble the ServerSmash, they’re attacking their own Illuminati. Now would the mid-tier ever? Would GOKU ever come after their Illuminati and its supporters? No, because they don’t eat their own. They don’t self-destruct. But for the zergfit establishment to be coming after the Illuminati, with accusations that are so false. They are so busted, the way that this thing works.


We, you, a diverse dynamic, needed support base that they would attack. And now, some of them even whispering, they’re ready to throw in for Negator over Cintesis because they can’t afford to see the status quo go. Otherwise, they won’t be able to be slurping off the gravy train that’s been feeding them all these years. They don’t want that to end.


Well, and then, funny, ha ha, not funny. But now, what they’re doing is wailing, 'well, Crossjon and his, uh, uh, uh, 1TR brigaders, they’re not leet enough.'


Oh my goodness gracious. What the heck would the zergfits know about leet play? Tell me, is this leet?


Zergfit majorities handing over a blank check to fund Wrelfare and LaneSmash and OO immigration that competes for your slots and turning ServerSmash into ShitterSmash. And all these new Connery shitters that are going to be coming on over border as we keep the borders open, and bequeathing our meta millions of shitfits, and refusing to fight back for our solvency and our sovereignty, even though that’s why we supported them and played VIKG in ConnerySmash. No! If they’re not willing to do that, then how are they to tell us that we’re not leet enough in order to be able to make these changes to Emerald that we know need to be made.


Now they’re concerned about this ideological purity? Give me a break! Who are they to say that? Oh, and tell somebody like SUIT. SUIT is the small-scale, squad play icon and hero and are Crossjon supporters. Tell them they're not good. How about the rest of us? Upvotin', brigader, poster', proud posters of our shitposts, our meta and our dakka and our dank memes. Tell us that we’re not leet enough? Yeah, coming from Connery. Right.


Well, he being the only one who’s been willing, he’s got the guts to wear the issues that need to be spoken about and debated on his sleeve. Where the rest of some of these server rep candidates, they just wanted to duck and hide. They didn’t want to talk about these issues until he brought them up. In fact, they’ve been wearing a, this, ""lol nobody cared about ServerSmash"" attitude kind of like a suicide vest. And enough is enough. These issues that Crossjon talks about had to be debated. And he brought them to the forefront and that’s why we are where we are today with good discussion. A good, heated and very competitive shitpost is where we are.


And now, though, to be lectured that, 'Well, you guys are all sounding kind of angry,' is what we’re hearing from the shitters. Doggone right we’re angry! Justifiably so! Yes!


You know, they stomp on our neck and then they tell us, 'Just chill, okay just yeah, just relax.'


Well, look, we are mad, and we’ve been had. They need to get used to it.

She based her assumption on the part in the trailer where you quickly see what looks like Harley lying in a vat of acid.

yeah, not to mention JaX and sam13's disgusting trans hate that made myself and another member uncomfortable enough to part ways with the outfit. Jax ruined a lot of my online interactions after that until last year, when i fully got over it. That shit was in 2013. I'm not sure if the person you mentioned is who I'm thinking of, but we still talk on occasion.

Kabei isn't out of the blame either, although his interactions with me were never negative, it's the officers meetings I got kicked out of that things got interesting, apparently.

Jax squad stacked every good player in Alpha, when Delta was left to a ragtag bunch of just-below-MLG players and myself, and every time I bought up or asked for someone to help balance us, it was ignored or I got yelled at for trying to get an extra fucking MAX player when I had exactly one, and he was on reserve. We were expected to be a QRF. We couldn't take a point half the time.

junglemonkey47,What looks cringeworthy about Suicide Squad?,cz6qj0m,t3_420zzw,,7,marvelstudios,,,2016-01-21
--Petrichor--,"I'll believe it when they make a good movie without Nolan. 

Man of Steel was okay, Suicide Squad looks cringe-worth. Batman v. Superman had me sold on the first trailer full trailer, but the second one definitely made me less excited. 

Clips from the new Wonder Woman have me excited, but haven't seen enough to put any amount of faith in it. 

&gt;The DCEU is coming out the gate swinging heavy.

You mean one decent (at best) movie followed by a three year break?

I'm not a Marvel fanboy. In fact, I would say I typically lean DC in every medium _except_ film. That's because Nolan is the _only_ one who has made a good DC movies. The old Superman movies were good for their time, but they have _not_ aged well. ",cz6p9ku,t3_420zzw,,7,marvelstudios,,,2016-01-21
PJL80,"GET OUT.

Kidding!  But I think you are putting the cart before the horse.  Let's see them put out some high quality, well received movies first.  Man of Steel was NOT equivalent to the original Iron Man.  And DC is so worried about playing catch-up they are blowing their load pretty early with the BvS including Wonder Woman, Lex and even freaking Doomsday.  Which sounds great, but that's a lot going on and we saw how over-packed AOU felt. 

That last trailer sold me a ticket to Suicide Squad, but I'm going to have to hear very strong reviewer feedback on BvS before I go rushing to the theater.  ",cz6povw,t3_420zzw,,7,marvelstudios,,,2016-01-21
linkenski,"#1: Play it how you want to. Don't get stuck up about self-imposed rules and OCD-playing. I had to stop myself at some point in Dragon Age Inquisition when I realized that the playstyle i had consciously decided to do was actively holding me back from enjoying my time with it. Now I skip everything I actually don't want to do, like a lot of investigative options, side-content and I play until I can feel that my interest span is running out after 2-3 hours. Then I make sure I only play when I feel invigorated to do so and stop once I'm drained so it doesn't end up being a back-to-back marathon play. Trust me, it's so much more enjoyable that way if you limit yourself a bit.

Aside from that, contentwise there are some thing that are neat to try. My suggestions:

ME1: Right after arriving at the Citadel, go down to the wards with Kaidan and Ashley and go to the sort of big wide dent where Terra Firma stands at the end of the game, and there'll be a nice conversation between all 3 characters with dialogue choices.

ME2: Bring Zaeed to Garrus' recruitment mission. Recruit Tali early, and when you get Legion, bring him to the Flotilla, it's great. Save Veetor and make sure Kal'Reegar doesn't die. Then select the neutral option to rally the crowd at Tali's trial. It's awesome.

Otherwise do whatever you like. The beauty of Mass Effect 3 is that it's such a personal story based on what has happened previously. Let the people who die at the end of ME2 die. It's rare that you get everyone out of the final mission alive. If you want Mordin to be alive for the Genophage arc though, make sure he's loyal before the suicide mission and take him on your squad. Otherwise there's a dice-roll to make him die when you're fleeing and that is super annoying.

Enjoy, and do try to explore a lot of the side content as it's really good in the first two games.",cz72jdi,t3_421zqk,,7,masseffect,,,2016-01-21

Daniel_Arshad,"First of all, they haven't made this Batman *that* old. He's got about 10-15 years before he's Dark Knight Returns age, and about 30 to go before he's as old as Bruce Wayne in Batman Beyond. 

Secondly, I'd like to see them reserve the grand scale, epic world ending threats for the Justice League films, and keep the tone of the Batman solo films more grounded. We've already seen from the Suicide Squad trailer and Wonder Woman sneak peek that WB has no qualms about the various DCEU films employing different tones and whatnot. Batman's solo films I'd like to see tackle a thriller/mystery approach. In that light, Under The Red Hood, Hush, Court Of Owls, and The Black Glove are all stories they could take cues from. I'd like to see Riddler be the main villain in a movie, as well. Lastly, I don't think they're gonna wait until JL 2 is out to release a Batman film. At the latest I expect a solo Batman film to be out by early 2019.",cz6r6n9,t3_42120w,,5,DC_Cinematic,,,2016-01-21
Aurondarklord,"Okay, and this is coming from someone who thinks the dirty, slapdash aesthetic of Suicide Squad sucks, these criticisms are inane.  Harley is so consciously aware of her own sexuality in the comics that she actually sometimes *directly talks to the reader about it*.  She would bend over and show the camera her ass not because that's just where it focused, but because she's so fourth-wall-shatteringly crazy that any given version of her might actually know the camera is there and be *doing it on purpose*.  Her costumes are ALWAYS sexualized, she is a member of a supervillainess team that called themselves the SIRENS for God's sake.

And if you don't think Enchantress wears anything that skimpy, you don't read comics, her giant comic book boobs are practically bursting out of the tiny corset she wears with her canon outfit.",cz6sf9p,t3_41zpkd,,5,TumblrInAction,,,2016-01-21

_the_watcher,"What? The DCEU has had *one* film come out, which was at best, thoroughly mediocre. While Suicide Squad looks like it could be fantastic, and the clips and news we've seen of Wonder Woman look encouraging, but Batman v. Superman looks simply awful. 

Batman is a great hero, as is The Flash. Superman is astoundingly hard to relate to most of the time, and has consistently proven difficult to adapt to the screen in today's era. Aquaman could be done well, but will suffer from Entourage, as well as having really stupid powers when summarized. Wonder Woman is a great hero and props to DC for going out and trying to make a female led film. The rest of the team, outside of perhaps the Green Lantern, are nowhere near as iconic as the Avengers.

On top of all of this, Marvel has shown a consistent ability to make, at worst, decent films. DC, outside of Nolan's Dark Knight films, simply has not.",cz6r1ee,t3_420zzw,,5,marvelstudios,,,2016-01-21

Justice_Prince,"Birds of Prey would be at the top of the list for me.  This is one I was actually really hoping would have been squeezed in the middle of the current line up.  I think one more street level movie thrown in the mix would have been nice plus as far as I'm concerned the more female heroes we see the better.

This one seems like the one we have the best chance of getting, but the next on my list is Justice League Dark.  I love the magic side of things so I really want to see that explored fully in this universe.  Hopefully we'll get more news about this soon.

When they eventually get to the New Gods I think the perfect film to explore that with would be Forever People.  This would be a fun movie that I think would be kinda like Guardians of the Galaxy in tone.  I think it would be a good way to get a feel for the worlds of the New Gods without getting too dredged down in the politics of the New Gods.

Next on my list is Crime Syndicate.  I know a lot of people want to see a movie where the Justice League fights the Crime Syndicate, but honestly that doesn't interest me much.  I'd much rather see a movie that takes place entirely on Earth 3.  No crossing over but instead making a movie that fully explores this universe on it's own.

 Last I'm gonna go with The Outsiders.  I don't really know too much about this group, but I think it would be cool to see a movie about some Justice League rejects.  I'm thinking the original lineup, but minus Katana since she's already be in Suicide Squad, and Birds of Prey, and Batman would be more on the back burner playing more of a mentor role.

Rofelli,"The Suicide Squad was a group from DC Comics. Composed of supervillains, most of whom are on death row, they perform covert missions on behalf of the U.S. government. It's completely off-the-books, so the government can maintain deniability, and because they're all bad guys, they're considered expendable.

The prisoners are some of the worst and most powerful that have been captured, but they generally agree to go on the missions, usually in return for better treatment (and, in some cases, shorter sentences). To keep them under control, the members of the squad have bombs surgically implanted in their skulls. If they get captured, refuse to follow orders, turn on each other, try to escape or otherwise go off mission, they can be blown up at the push of a button.

The Suicide Squad ultimately reports to a morally-gray American government official named Amanda Waller. Her exact job varies depending on which comic you're reading, but she's always high-ranking and doing something that involves people with superpowers, although she herself does not possess any.

Kim-Jong_Bundy,"They showed off concept art to all of the Justice League members during the same special when they debuted the Suicide Squad trailer.   During The Flash's segment, it was artwork of Barry doing forensic work at a crime scene, with Ezra Miller talking about how he's determined to prove his father's innocence.   The hope that I'm clinging to is they'll just summarize his origins in Justice League and then when The Flash's solo film comes around, they'll give us something different and just do a full-on Flashpoint movie.   




As for Oliver, it doesn't look like they're using Green Arrow right off the bat.  Right now, it's confirmed the Justice League will just be Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, &amp; Cyborg.    Hal Jordan &amp; John Stewart are getting their own movie in 2020 and I'm guessing, if the whole slate works out, Green Arrow will come soon after.

I read a strategy awhile back about sending four newbies into a dungeon with low (or zero) supplies on a suicide mission to upgrade the hamlet.

The key thing these 'journalists' who decided to jump on the superhero bandwagon and think all superhero movies should follow a very distinct formula (which essentially remakes the same movie over and over with only a few exceptions, hi Marvel Studios) when comparing Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad?

One's a movie about villains, the other heroes, one of which is facing a divided world, the other 20 years into his run and with an accordingly cynical outlook. Anyone who tells me villains aren't as colourful and fun as heroes should get a clue- villains revel in chaos, mania, and enjoy the damage they sow. Heroes shouldn't be running around fighting crime with a smile on their face.

Squad looks amazing and fun, but just as its first trailer was crapped on for being 'too dark,' BVS gets the same treatment, because apparently it's a crime for movies to have any thought or substance in them that doesn't have a quick quip inserted every two lines.

090078601,"&gt; You can say the same about Captain American, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk, but they still gave them their own movies because it made the eventual team up much more satisfying.

You really cannot. Not even remotely similar. The only Marvel heroes even close to the level Batman and Superman are on before 2008 were Spider-man and Wolverine. Neither of which Marvel owned.

Bats and Supes are on another level of recognition. Wonder Woman is *the* female superhero. Average moviegoers might not know much about her, but you can bet they know who she is. As long as the anchors are recognisable, the other 4 aren't as big an issue.

Lets be honest, do you think everyone who watched the Avengers watched *all* the films that came before it? Hell, I'm a bit of a comic book junkie and I still haven't seen Captain America: The First Avenger. 

Also, when the Avengers came out in 2012, the Hulk's ""in-universe"" film was really only sort of canon. Audiences didn't seem *at all* confused by the fact that Edward Norton had been replaced in the Avengers by Mark Ruffalo, did they? And Hawkeye and Black Widow didn't (and still don't) have films. So of the 6 Avengers, 3 had films after the start of the MCU, 3 didn't. With the JL, Batman and Supes will have had a joint film, Supes will have had another film, and Wonder Woman will have had her own film and a role in BvS. Suicide Squad will expand the universe a bit more. By JL there will be a universe that's built up enough for the JL to be a thing.",cz7fc12,t3_42267a,,14,movies,,,2016-01-22

Eagle713,"Wait...

  So first off, how many heroes and villains have had multiple origins due to lies, reboots, retcons, and the like?  All of them?  I was afraid of that.

  So how many of them have at least one origin where something horrible or tragic happens to them that removes their agency (A word which is used poorly in this case, as it makes them sound helpless just because something bad happened to them) and causes them to have a Very Bad Day that leads to them either being a Hero or a Villain?  Yeah, pretty much all of them.  I'm seeing a trend.

And how many film directors tend to pick the most visually interesting, dramatic, or exploitable origin?  All of them again?  Who'dathunkit?

  Let's be honest.  Most origins are about something terrible happening (your home planet blowing up, your parents getting shot in front of you, you gaining powers and your uncle dies) and the character has not a whit of agency.  The character's agency is in full evidence depending upon what they decide to do after the Very Bad Day.  

  Very few people want to read about someone who sets out to be a hero just due to an over-developed sense of do-goodism.  It just doesn't make for interesting reading.  Instead, something happens beyond their control, and how they react to this out-of-whack event shows us who they are, and more importantly, what they are.

  It matters not what origin a director chooses, someone is going to have a fit over it.  Harley's original origin would take an entire movie to do it justice (and I would pay money to watch it), and it's definitely not going to work in an ensemble piece the size of Suicide Squad.  You can't even touch on it in a 2 hour movie where we have roughly 10 minutes to spotlight each character.  

  Pure silliness.

  But this is what happens when someone who can string together coherent sentences into a readable column starts thinking they somehow understand what it takes to be a writer and cram an entertaining story into a feature length movie.

Snark88,"If BvS is a critical bomb, then I don't think the DCCU will end, because they're not just gonna put a stop to WW and JL's production. They've invested too much already. However they will be in serious trouble. They'll depend heavily on Suicide Squad being a hit at that point, and then from there hope Wonder Woman will be decent enough.

But I would imagine they would have to replace Zack Snyder at that point. I mean unless BvS still makes a shitzillion dollars, but if the movie really sucks it probably won't meet expectations. If WB were smart in that scenario, they'd say bye bye to him at that point. With Man of Steel I would say Goyer was the weakest link in all the talent they had working on that movie. This time they have a much better writer. So if they fail a 2nd time around, Zack will probably be voted off the island.",cz77468,t3_42267a,,7,movies,,,2016-01-22

The problem is, Marvel Studios had no history and could sort of make their own way without a bunch of studio executives who have been around getting in the way to explain why shared universes will never work and why superhero movies should just be modern action movies with a superhero reskin. It allowed them to do something really unique. So far, I haven't seen DC really shake things up and try to make a superhero movie that isn't just an action movie with a thin veneer of Superman on top. Suicide Squad looks interesting but I'm worried that they won't be able to really lean into utilizing the freedom a shared universe gives you and that they will continue to churn out movies that ignore what makes each character unique as if they're embarrassed by their comic book roots.",cz7ee7k,t3_41zxj0,,6,DCcomics,,,2016-01-22

hamlet_d,"While I understand that, the fact is that TV and movies are different animals and a case can be made that tying a series into a larger movie narrative can hobble the TV side (and vice versa).  So, for example, look at Supergirl and Flash.  Supergirl has recently introduced [the Martian Manhunter](/spoiler) who could also end up in the movie universe.  If they were tied one of two things might have happened.  First, he might not have appeared in the series because the movies wanted to use him, or secondly the movies would have got him and the actor would have to be someone who wasn't up for a regular TV appearance.  Likewise with the Flash and his rogues.

Another example is Gotham: if they are the same universe and we have an ""older"" Batman/Bruce.  That puts restrictions on the setting and villians you can use in the TV show (or movies).  The Joker origin in Gotham is going to be much different than the one we see hinted at in Suicide Squad and BvS.

seniorkite,"It's a good question, especially considering how fun Suicide Squad looks in comparison. No one is going to give two shits about the Justice League if a movie about the villains, which are NOT the main players of the universe, does extremely well. 

I think things will come back around when the next solo Batman movies comes out. As much as we've seen the Joker Vs. Batman on the big screen, I'm really kind of excited about Leto's new take, vs. Affleck.

damnmaster,"To answer your point. I feel that all media works should be taken in case by case basis, the line of sex object and sex icon is very blur and cannot be black and white, what looks sexist in one area may not be in another. 

This is a strange leap of logic, of course video games/movie/comics don't turn people into rapists and murderers. 

But to say they have no effect on people is dishonest and incorrect. People do get influenced by it, time and time again we see it happen subtly. Perhaps we don't turn into raging psychopaths but everything in the world influences who we are and how we think. Everyone is susceptible to it while many believe they are strong enough to resist. 

The point is whether her sexuality has a meaning or a reason. if she is just flashing boobs for fan service, it's pretty obvious her role is just to bring in more buyers (As some people stated here before, ""sex sells"") And thus doesn't create an inclusive environment for other readers (girls/younger people) that appreciate it. 

Boys and girls will get affected by new information differently, it's not a matter of one person having a stronger fortitude, different lessons get taken away from watching the same movie. Guys will be looking at male characters for inspiration and girls for female characters. A mental exercise I do when watching a film/comic/game is asking myself three questions:

1. Can I introduce this to my little sister?
2. What is it like if I switched the sex of all the characters?
3. If I was only watching the female characters, what do I get out of it?

Empathizing with people is an easy way to understand why someone may get pissed off or angry. I don't agree with everything told by feminists because even after empathizing with them I can see how some of their points are ridiculous but it doesn't mean that all of their points are.

Some movies end up fine. Mad Max was great because the female lead was badass and the movie didn't need to cram ""feminist messages"" down my throat. The characters acted like they were in a movie and the subtle lesson of ""girls can do this too"" came after rather than vice versa.


The second half of this post is a rant about suicide squad and Harley

I'm not saying that using sex to sell is a bad thing.But I didn't see old Harley as a sex object because she was more goofy than sexy unlike new Harley who sleeps around at on just because she now likes sex and wearing more and more revealing clothes that have nothing to do with a harlequin (The original inspiration for her outfit). Though there was a comic that addressed that (Something about her not liking to wear the same thing). But this point is just my personal opinion about the New 52 Harley Quinn compared to her old version. She is less interesting as a character now since they rebooted her. Her entire character development went more towards sex and less towards her goofy cute nature from previous incarnations.

In the suicide squad movie, the costume choices are bad. Even for the guys. In the comics each and every one of them were easily spotted and recognisable. Movie DC seems to be dark colours on and on and on with little to no palatte change compared to the comics. It's not campy to add more colour to your repertoire.

When I picture superman I always see as that unstoppable boring guy. That's how most of the people who don't follow superman think. Batman v Superman just looks like a typical super hero movie with big special effects.

A lot of people have seen the dark knight and loved the joker. And they see the suicide squad as something different than the typical super hero movie

Fallinggravity,"""Harley's origin was tweaked. She remained a doctor at Arkham Asylum where she ""treated"" the Joker, but knew from the get go that he was lying to her. Regardless, she still fell for him, and when she found out that her superior was stealing her research for a book, it drove Harley to help the Joker escape. Joker would bring her to the chemical plant where Batman caused the accident that bleached his skin, deforming him, and throws Harley into the same chemicals, causing a similar effect on her.""
 
Since I don't remember much about that Suicide Squad issue I looked up Harley's New 52 origin on comicvine. Harley had agency in her origin, she was treating the Joker at Arkham and chose to release him and leave with him.

PJL80,"This is going to be a fantastic year, I'm looking forward to pretty much all of these....a little on the fence with two of them.

My best guess:

#1) Marvel.  Captain America Civil War has all of the known quantities for success.  The MCU brand, RDJ, enough heroes in the film to be mini-Avengers.  It's the safest bet from a general movie going audience perspective.  So it will have high expectations, and even if it does really well, it will be a little ""ho-hum"" from the hipsters and the movie reviewers.  Doctor Strange has great star power with Cumberbatch, the youth crowds that are into Sherlock, his Academy nominated role in ""The Imitation Game"", etc.  Plus it's weird and different, something that might get that ""refreshing"" tag after a run of pretty standard ""blow em up"" summer movies.

2) WB.  All potential upside.  BvS has been under a very successful media blitz, you can't turn on a TV or a Youtube video without getting smacked with an advertisement for the film.  The top two franchise characters, a month ahead of Civil War, and franchise building cameo's galore.  Should be a big hit, followed by lots of media love, because it's new.  Not a slight at them or Marvel, but the media always wants something new.   I still keep WB at #2 because we need to see the movie first.  Man of Steel was a little underwhelming, didn't hit it out of the park with audiences or critics, it was more style than substance.  Suicide Squad is a wildcard.  It either will be the surprise hit of the year like GOTG, or the ""it was so good, why didn't anyone see it?"" disappointment.

3) Fox.  Deadpool looks fantastic, and I'm glad that it's rated R for so many reasons.  But that will affect the box office, so that will hurt earnings potentials.  That's just fact, always has been.  X-men Apocalypse looks iffy....they've done a good job of rebooting the franchise, but I don't see it having the mass appeal of the MCU or the excitement of a burgeoning DCU.",cz8aocg,t3_41y6nr,,1,comicbookmovies,,,2016-01-22

Ssutuanjoe,"Guardians of the Galaxy is based on a comic book, yet managed to avoid feeling mechanically and extremely deliberate in execution.

Pretty much all of the Marvel movies, while obviously geared toward merchandising, managed to put together movies that didn't feel like a bunch of old, white baby boomers sitting in a room asking what ""teens these days like?"" 

(In reference to above) Hell, even the first Iron Man movie managed to put some pretty socially relevant topics together for a strong movie.

So I'm afraid I don't understand what you're driving toward, really. It's extremely possible to put together a movie based on literature (yes, even COMIC BOOKS) that have decent, socially relevant topics that steer clear away from the sterile feel of this trailer. 

Other commenters did a pretty decent job *discussing* why I should expect Suicide Squad to be ridiculous, although I'm still not quite sure it's going to be ridiculous in a way that's even remotely enjoyable. ",cz7oe2m,t3_41sbrc,,1,movies,,,2016-01-22

I have the same problem with suicide squad Harley Quinn. That is not the same character from the animated series she originated in. AS Harley is fun to watch. SS Harley is... meh.

CoconutWally,"Okay, I touched on it in a post a while back but after the trailer drop my theory is confirmed. They are going to pull straight from the animated film Assault on Arkham. Here's how I think the Suicide Squad film will play out; Waller has collected the squad and has placed transmitters in their necks, to track and also keep them in line (Waller puts explosives in the transmitters). From there we see them being collected to meet up with Rick Flagg. Flagg briefs them on their mission which is more than likely "" The Joker has planted a dirty bomb in Gotham and they are tasked to stop him. Since Batman in on another case and out of the picture (so we think, in Attack on Arkham he was after the Riddler then ends up in the cross fire of Jokers Breakout) ANNNYWAY, from there we are going to see the skwad rip through a bunch of henchmen to get to the Joker and try and stop him; but plot twist Harley is actually helping him with his plan, and shit starts hitting the fan of course. The two fuck off on their own and cause chaos but not before Batman and the rest of the skwad take down the Joker and Harley. If it goes in a different direction fucking awesome I'll be pumped. If It doesn't I'll be still happy because I love that flick and to see a live action version will blow my mind. 

So that folks, is my theory.

MysticalGreenBeanie,"so, after the DCEU Dawn of the Justice league event a little bit ago, i decided to make a video inspired from what i was seeing. and this is the result

BvS-won't be BAD. i feel like i should correct that. it won't ""suck"" but it won't be good. and it CAN'T be good. it has a lot of balls to juggle and i don't feel like this movie will be able to do everything the DCEU needs it to do, AND be a good movie at the same time.

Suicide squad-this will go down in history as the movie that changed the game. i might be exaggerating a bit...or not. i really don't know. all i know for sure is that this movie is going to be really great

wonder woman- the more i see gal gadot in the role, the more she's starting to win me over. you guys have to understand, wonder woman has recently become one of my favorite comic book characters of all time, and i may or may not be a little obsessive or defensive of the character. and i really want her to have an amazing film. and based off what i've been seeing, i'm down. 

justice league- this movie will rock. and it will rock hard. that is all

john1106,"As much as I disagree about the article, It does make a interesting point on why batman v superman have mixed reception as quoted by the article:

""""This muddled marketing can be traced all the way back to the title of the movie. By itself, Batman V Superman would have been a fine title for a comic book movie. Dawn of Justice would also have been a fine title. But instead these two concepts, which don’t gel together particularly well, have been forced together into one jumbled message that dilutes the appeal of the movie rather than strengthening it. The promise of Batman and Superman coming together with other superheroes to form the Justice League takes the bite out of the promise of Batman and Superman fighting one another. The reveal of Doomsday triggered a wave of complaints about spoilers, but really those spoiler complaints should have been directed at the movie’s title.

Perhaps Warner Bros. should have taken the advice of Billy Flynn, the charming lawyer from the musical Chicago, who tells his client Roxie Hart, “We can only sell them one idea at a time.“ Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is trying to sell two very different ideas at the same time, whereas Suicide Squad has one idea (“Worst. Heroes. Ever.“) that it’s pouring all of its enthusiasm into.""""",cz7o5ud,t3_4250o0,,-6,DC_Cinematic,,,2016-01-22

This is a common thing with DC, something Arrow has been subjected to as well. The [exec producers wanted to use Ted Kord](http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=54363), but DC said no, so Brandon Routh became Ray Palmer instead.

I'd like to see a Joker who is actually crazy and scary and not just an angry anarchist. Everything that I have seen so far of the Leto's Joker tells me that the former is what we are getting and I couldn't be happier. 

People are bitching about the characters being overly edgy. Well duh, that is what Suicide Squad is. Under the New 52 with DC, it ran under the imprint, ""The Edge"" along with Wildstorm characters and Jonah Hex.

I went to attack their last army that had lots of cavalry but it turns out billmen are not actually spearmen. Seeing how this was a potential problem with their cavalry I had to think of something else that happened to worked wonderfully. It went something like this:

* I set up a defensive line and had all of my archers plant their stakes during the deployment phase.
* Once I started the battle I simply had all of my archers and ballistae fire at the AI's army that wasn't moving.
* When they ran out of ammo I told them to withdraw, and the AI still sat there.
* I then order more units to withdraw little by little until I was left with only my general and one squad of billmen on the field, the AI still hadn't moved.
* After ordering both to withdraw the AI finally leaped into action and charged at me... right into the stakes my archers had planted.
* During this mass suicide on sharpened sticks their general managed to get himself killed by the stakes.
* At this point they couldn't catch my general but they did capture the last 24 billmen from the final squad.
* They executed the captured billmen but I managed to severely weaken their army by just shooting at them and running away.

butchthedoggy,"Do you know how easy it is to avoid Homing Shot?  When you see the red arrow at the top/side/wherever of your screen, just get behind cover that is between you and the direction of the arrow.  Works 9 times out of 10.

Homing Shot is actually quite useful- say you have someone (in Drop Pod for capping a pod, for example) who bubbles up.   Regular blasters don't work unless you have Ion Shot, and running up for melee rarely goes well.  Solution?  Homing Shot.

Say you have a group of 2-3 people who are capping a point in Supremacy, and one of them puts down Squad Shield, smugly thinking that'll guarantee them the cap.  Again, regular blasters don't work, attempting to melee is almost guaranteed suicide, and no one uses Cycler Rifle.  Solution?  Watch their disbelief as you pop of a shot from Homing Shot that goes right through their ""impenetrable"" shield.

Those are only 2 of its uses, off the top of my head.  So no, homing shot is not for ""pussies who cannot aim"".

wilderwinds,"I totally get what you're saying here – not about the new Suicide Squad movie per say (for me, it's Star Wars), but I also find bandwagoners annoying. Which is somewhat silly to me, because I also think that everyone is a ""bandwagoner"" with some kind of things in their lives, it just might not be the same from person to person. 

I guess my beef with bandwagoners is that they assume they know so much about something that they really don't know about, and then they try and act suprerior to people who may have been in the fandom longer. Granted, being in a fandom longer doesn't always mean you'll know more, but it's more likely that you will. Plus, the longer you're in a fandom shows your loyalty and interest in the topic much more than it does for the bandwagoners. I appreciate them getting into the fandom and enjoying whatever it is they're supposed to enjoy, but it does get a little irritating after awhile. I guess they should just remember that they're new, and that there are things that they should learn. But it's not a bad thing that they should learn things about the fandom, they should just keep an open and eager mind about it. 

(I'm really sorry. I just turned this into a rant of my own, didn't I? TLDR; I guess I'm agreeing with OP.)

Ok, thanks for the reminder, it's been a while since I've seen ""Under the Red Hood"". There could be a time gap between this and the Batman adaption, but based on where things are right now, it might make more sense to have him play a more major role in this movie and maybe have it set after the Red Hood adaption.

Also, I looked Bronze Tiger up, and he sounds like a great character to use. Yea, weretiger's a bit out there (if they decide to go that route, and not have the Tiger part be a nickname or alias), but Suicide Squad is going all in with Killer Croc and it looks like they will pull it off, so it could work if they'd really go all in and have him be an actual weretiger.",cz8nkrr,t3_426x6f,,1,DC_Cinematic,,,2016-01-23

_Balian_,My theory is that the Joker kills Jason Todd in a flashback and that Harley thinks he has gone too far. We see a Robin costume in the bat cave in the BvS trailer.

Snaaaaaaaaaake,"Because this is the ""you get it"" song for a lot of people growing up.  Remember when you were a kid (be honest) and you loved smash mouth and backstreet boys and 98 degrees and even Tom Green's ""My bum"" song?  We all go through that phase when were kids, first we listen to our parents music, then we fall in love with a celebrity or just listen to the popular music our 5th grade peers like.  We grow, we keep hearing the pop music, we don't know what ""Indie"" bands are yet, what don't even know what ""good"" music is yet.  Our definition of ""good"" music is catchy, poppy, sounds cool and stuff.

Then, sometime when you turn 12 or 13 or 14, you here Bohemian rhapsody.  And something just clicks with you.  It's a slow paced song, but it's catchy, you never liked slow pace before, but you are somehow drawn to it, are those piano chords, why do I feel emotions, does anything really matter, is it okay to kiss girls?  What you don't realize is, one you're going through puberty, and two for the first time you're actually listening to music.  You're not just bobbing your head up and down (although you will later in the song) you're connecting with this singer.  Even if you heard the song before when you were younger, now it finally starts to click.  So you ask, is there other music out there like this?  Music that makes you feel?  Music built for your emotions?   And so your search begins....

But still, why Bohemian Rhapsody?  I'm sure there are other songs that are also popular that when you hear for the first time in your teens you really connect to...Baba O'Reilly...Dark side of the moon....Sail away.  I just think it comes full circle, queen is popular, you hear Bohemian Rhapsody everywhere, just look at the new Suicide Squad trailer.

Keven-Rus,"I work in the promotions department of a tv network. Basically they make 10 second - 3 minute promotions for shows.

The Suicide Squad trailer was pure gold. It gets you hyped without spoiling the plot. It is edited perfectly, and doesn't ruin any major plot points.

The Batman v Superman trailer is ALMOST ALL PLOT POINTS. Your not supposed to do that. It's not spoiling so much as ruining the magic of those reveals. Like the first time Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne meet, to the first time Doomsday appears. It's an okay trailer. The problem is intelligent people are able to surmise the whole plot. On the flip-side SS doesn't reveal any.

sulleyandmike,"&gt; Metropolis is frequently depicted as being within driving distance of Gotham City, home of Batman. This happens, for example, in the three-issue 1990 mini-series of World's Finest Comics by Dave Gibbons, Steve Rude, and Karl Kesel. Like Metropolis, Gotham's location has never been definitively established; however, it is usually treated as also being a major city. The distance between the two cities has varied greatly over the years, ranging from being hundreds of miles apart to Gotham and Metropolis being twin cities on opposite sides of Delaware Bay, with Gotham City in the location of Cape May Point, New Jersey and Metropolis in the location of Lewes, Delaware.

I believe I was only able to clear the board a couple of times and that was mainly due to just drawing easier squads.  I also didn't know about the retreat/force close option until after it was patched, so every day was just trying to learn from the previous runs and trying better team comps and improve my tactics.  As my characters became stronger, it became a lot easier to clear the board (I've cleared it successfully every day since the patch).  So depending on what you have invested in, it may just be a matter of time before you're tearing through the battles.

I'm not sure if you're aware of the Retreat/Force Close option, but if one of the battles turns into a trainwreck you have the option to reset the battle by retreating or force closing the game.  Basically makes it so the battle never happened.  This option is nice so you can experiment with different team comps and improve upon your target selection (who the best people to kill first are depending on their team comp and your available CDs).  

Since GW unlocks later after LS/DS/Cantina/Arena battles, it might be tempting to use a duplicate squad setup that you were successful with in the other modes.  I had done that and while it was successful in battles where all of my CDs are up, I found that I had to work a lot harder to keep myself in a good position for the board run.  I tried an entirely different team setup that I never ran in any of the other modes and found that it made things much easier even though I wasn't sure how well it would work out when I first tried it.  Don't be afraid to experiment.

To expand on what ChickenHUN said, I use two healers (I believe some people run three).  If I walk into a battle against a tough opponent and both heals are on CD, I reset the battle and sub one of my attackers out for Poe and use his taunt (you could sub one of the healers out if you don't have enough damage).  I usually kill 1-2 players before the first turn is over, Poe has taunted, so he typically lives and I go into the next battle with both heals ready to rock.

Managing cooldowns.  When you're in easier battles or have knocked the opponent down to two characters, you may want to consider dragging the battle out as long as you can so that any CDs that you want up (assume that your next battle will always be your hardest) will be available for the next fight.  For example, if they have two heroes up and one is a healer I'll hit the healer (and not kill them) and have them use the heal so I can get some additional turns in on my heroes to reset CDs or if one gets really low I'll leave it up for my heaviest hitter to kill (FOTP) to draw out the fight longer.  FOTP kills a lot of things in his turn so using that trick helps a lot with stalling.  In my last run I went into a fight with a good chunk of my abilities on CD.  The opponent had three healers.  I killed the two attackers off in the first turn and stalled the fight (allowing them to heal as needed) and went into the fight after that with full health and all CDs available.  I know it's common to kill off healers first, but you can definitely use an enemy healer to your advantage in GW.

The last part of what ChickenHUN said is also a good tip.  You can send in a suicide squad to make the enemy burn their CDs.  Perhaps also make it a goal to kill off 1-2 of their team in the process.  After your defeat, the battle saves.  When you take your regular team back in, their abilities will still be on CD.

ncuday,"Yeah, Disney seems to have a sweet spot with Marvel on the first weekend in May and Star Wars in mid-December. Pixar in June, so after the first Marvel movie has settled down, Marvel Tier 2 in the late summer lull (which is a brilliant placement that worked really well for Guardians and to a lesser extent Ant Man, even WB has taken note with Suicide Squad), and Disney major animated film over Thanksgiving. I think they have enough space, and I don't think the other films will step on each others toes too much.

Imprisoned until they can figure out how to remove his powers.

So you're saying that imprisoning a guy for no reason other than your own fear is the moral choice? I disagree.

&gt;Not necessarily true. Magic is shown to be used in the Suicide Squad trailer and Batman is also in that trailer. So he knows about magic, and if you recall Superman is not immune to magic. This is Bat God we are talking about after all, he's fighting Superman.

That said, posters now are uninspired. The best ones I can find are usually ""alternates"", not the ones they put out in front of theaters. They'll always do at least one ""mainstream"" poster, and then maybe make an arsty one if they find the time and budget. The Suicide Squad poster is pretty good, at least. But generally they follow a template, the leads are on the poster, and there's rarely original artwork commissioned anymore.

I'm still a bit peeved over the Guardians, and the Inhuman thing isn't an issue because their books are actually good.

I wasn't trying to make it a Marvel vs DC thing at all as i enjoy both.

The fact of the matter is we don't know exactly how much this relaunch will effect the DCU, i just don't want characterization that flies in the face of everything before it as well as unnecessary costume changes. I would probably bitch if Lex suddenly started wearing a wig or Joker has ""damaged"" on his forehead.

Csantana,as someone who is basically in love with Marvel studios I could see WB winning. I know people are kinda worried about the last trailer but I imagine many of those are comic fans who might see the movie without word of mouth anyway. I feel like Batman and Superman meeting for the first time could be a big deal to a lot of people. Plus lets say it does better than Civil War. Even though that one I would argue could do better. But lets say BvS does do better. I could see Suicide Squad doing Better than Doctor Strange. If it gets a good word of mouth I see it being the next guardians of the galaxy (not an original idea but one I see credence in) especially as it includes some well known characters while doctor strange is a new thing. (also it comes out 2 weeks before the latest Potterverse movie) But yeah Marvel could totally sweep the floor too,cz9t75q,t3_41y6nr,,1,comicbookmovies,,,2016-01-24

The reason for this is because DC doesn't think the Titans alone could sell a movie (they had planned to make a Judas Contract movie long ago but cancelled for that very reason). They did the same thing when they sold Supergirl's origin movie as ""Superman/Batman: Apocalypse"" and the Suicide Squad animated movie as ""Batman: Arkham Assault.""

Bottom line is, they chose what are absolutely the most popular Titans in order to make the movie more appealing, both due to the more-or-less steady decline in sales of DC movies over the years and due to the potential for failure with less popular members (*cough*YoungJustice*cough*). However, if the movie sells well, then *maybe* we can get a Titans-focused sequel where they bring in the other big names from the comics.",czbb1lr,t3_42j81b,,8,DCcomics,,,2016-01-25

AhhBisto,"There isn't an official app but Comixology is partnered with DC for both iOS and Android. They have older stuff on sale there all the time and you can buy digital versions of trades too.

As for recommendations, it really depends on what characters interest you, if you're not sure, name some Marvel ones and myself and others can give you approximations of stuff you'd like on the DC side of things.

For starting from scratch though, i would suggest reading from New 52. There are decades of epic stories you miss out on but once you get a feel for characters and what they're about you will inevitably go and look for older things to read. I was in your position but with being a Marvel noob and found myself reading stuff mainly from the last 3-4 years and then going back to find older things.

The best New 52 series are largely considered to be Batman and Justice League, they keep up a level of quality like no other on-goings, i would put them in tier 1 in terms of how good they are. Just below that are books with largely good arcs and quality but with small dips, so the likes of Wonder Woman (mainly Azzarello's run), Green Lantern (Geoff Johns' run), The Flash (Manapul and Buccellato's run), Batman &amp; Robin, Sinestro and Aquaman.

Then in tier 3, you'd have Action Comics, Batgirl, Animal Man, Swamp Thing, Green Lantern Corps and Red Lanterns.

There are plenty of books with solid runs but depending on how picky you are, they don't warrant buying all of the trades. These would include Superman, Suicide Squad and Earth 2.

Then you have the newer books. These are the ones DC brought out long after the start of New 52 and really represent the company hitting the ground running with some great ideas and some excellent team ups. Grayson, Gotham By Midnight, Justice League 3000, Harley Quinn, Batman Eternal, Futures End and Gotham Academy make up these titles.

Lastly you then have DC You. Which was a company wide initiative to bring in some diversity to both the comics world and to their own creative teams. For me they have largely been a big hit, and they include Doctor Fate, Cyborg, Midnighter, Martian Manhunter, The Omega Men, Prez, Bizarro.....and probably 4 or 5 more. I could go on all day.

So to summarise (lol, you'd kinda need one after all i've written, right?) it really does come down to what kind of stories you enjoy. If you like tales of the fight against crime on an urban level, you'd probably like Batman related titles. If magic is more your thing, Hellblazer and Doctor Fate would be more up your street. If it's a cosmic level type deal you like, Green Lantern, Sinestro and Omega Men all day. If you want big epic fights and crazy action, you can't go wrong with Justice League, Action Comics and Aquaman. And for light hearted stories, Prez, Bizarro and Gotham Academy will do just fine.

Jay794,"It would be nice, but unfortunately as they want to make as much money as possible, they make movies (animated or not) to appeal to the widest audience as possible. It's kind of annoying because they put pointless shit in the movies just to appeal to everyone, for example, the Hulk/Widow love story, no comic fan really cares about that, people just want to see Stark blowing shit up, Hulk smashing stuff and Thor making jokes. Take Deadpool and Suicide Squad for example, both films deserve to be 18's to be as true as possible to the comics, but by doing that both companies limited the amount of money they can make, so they make the 15's, or even 12's so that kids can see them",czb0sz3,t3_42k95z,,1,Marvel,,,2016-01-25

MathieuCochet,"*Looks around for something else to try, looking between some ARs and shotguns.* The Suicide Squad..... Cerberus agents, thieves, mercs, assassins, convicts, Quarian Admiral daughters, a exCSec agent, an exSTG operative and an Asari Justicar. *Grins.* Why, I don't know what you mean, Kas. That sounds totally normal. *Reaches for a Claymore, then quickly goes to a Scimitar instead.* Did you expect all of us to be moustache twirling, evil people plotting galactic domination all the time? *Quirks an eyebrow as he aims the shotgun.* Plenty of normal people were in the organization too,/we were most of the ones that defected. *He fires off the shotguns 8 shot clip at the closest targets, the wide spread making it easy to hit them, before he stows it as well with a grin.* I didn't mind firing that one either.

kkbodz17,"There are many different ways to get into comics and I saw a lot of people suggesting really good ways but I actually got into comics relatively recently and now most of my friends come to me for comic book knowledge so I'll just tell you how I did it. I started out with my favorite hero: The Flash. I read all of his stuff straight through. I call him my entry point hero. I then read Justice League to build out my world a little more. Then I started adding on hero by hero (this is all New 52 btw). Some important things to remember about New 52 though: Batman's history was kept canon but condensed into 5 years, so any Batman story you read Pre New 52 still counts. Same with Green Lantern, except his history wasn't condensed into 5 years to the best of my knowledge.
But here are the best heroes to start with in my opinion:
Flash
Batman
Aquaman.
They were the best runs. Other good comics to read once you are established:
New Suicide Squad
Batman Beyond
Batman: Eternal

akafamilyfunny,"They may only work on South Park for what amouts to three months out of the year now but I guarantee you they're working hard on the game. My theory is it will be led into after the next season of the show.

And if I may can I just say how awesome this year is going to be (ideally)? Not just for South Park but for lots of stuff. Great looking popcorn movies like Suicide Squad and Deadpool. Great TV Shows are coming back, like Archer and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. In the video game world we have Zelda U, and Uncharted 4, and of course the new South Park RPG.

If my theory is correct not only will the new season address the presidential election, and continue with discussing PC culture (because, let's face it... it's still a thing) but it may somehow be solved by Coon and Friends, and if true that's a lot to look forward too. Don't want to jinx it but South Park season 20 is looking to be a good one.",czbc9dm,t3_42fujh,,1,southpark,,,2016-01-25

Hawkmouth,"I think there's a beauty in a sci-fi story written scientifically accurate, the writer who overcome the constraints and challenges to produce a scientifically accurate story is a good writer.

No you don't go to Star Wars to see accurate science, but when you see how Interstellar was beautifully written story about sacrifice, saving humanity, and a father relationship with his kids, all that you see with the accurate science of relativity, mathematical equations, and further dimensions. Now that is a good writing.

That doesn't mean I don't appreciate the craziness in movies, you see how The Dark Knight characters are changed in a way that they're believable and non sci-fi, I think that's fantastic, yet I'm excited for all the crazy shit in Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad. A good movie is a good movie. ",czb0h4q,t3_42i1u2,,1,AskReddit,,,2016-01-25

First, Dad is exposed to some upcoming comic book film trailers of Batman Vs Superman and Suicide Squad. Patrick explains the Vertigo comic imprint concept to Dad, and laments the “Vertigo Artstyle” of the 1990’s.   Dad and Patrick love Matt Wagner’s creepy Sandman world and dark noir style.

AveDominusNox,"Stuff like this always reminds me to not let trailers get me worked up or let down. Much like reality TV, Someone takes the footage and edits it to match whatever message the marketing team is slinging. Makes it fit whatever narrative they think will reign in their target demographic. 

When you compare the first suicide squad trailer with the second It's highly unlikely that the movie itself took a serious shift in tone between them being published. It's a lot more likely the Marketing team decided they needed to play up the humor to try and bandwagon the silliness of the Deadpool marketing campaign (Which has been getting a lot of exposure).",czbcewi,t3_42lawq,,1,movies,,,2016-01-25
