Danishroyalty,"I'm okay with it, because I could see it going a few ways in regards to Goblin. 

1. There is an MCU version of Norman/GG. Peter is on high alert when he meets this Osborn, is immediately suspicious and begins investigating him. However, this Osborn is not actually doing anything nefarious, until Peter gets involved and ruins something, which causes Osborn/Goblin to hate Peter with a burning passion. Thus Peter creates his own villain. 

2. There is no MCU Norman/GG. But Norman's technology from NWH is discovered by Roderick Kingsley and he becomes the Hobgoblin. He keeps the GG Halloween themes but is a very different type of rival to Peter. This is my preference, rather than retreading the already twice used Norman and Harry storyline. 

As for Doc Ock, I really dont know what theyll do. Introducing a totally new version after bringing back Molina seems weird. Maybe Molina's Ock stays in this universe and remains evil, showing up as a recurring villain trying to form the Sinister Six.",ha29o41,t3_pa50y8,/r/marvelstudios/comments/pa50y8/something_i_realized_after_watching_the_nwh/ha29o41/,554,marvelstudios,False,0,2021-08-23

He wasn't the one who leaked the trailer, but unfortunately, he was the cause of it.

He's already lost his job and several friends, and hasn't responded to ANY correspondence all day from anyone, which is not normal at all.

KostisPat257,"&gt;First of all, Far From Home takes place 6 months after Endgame

It takes place 8 months after Endgame in June/July 2024 according to Betty Brant.

&gt;meaning that No Way Home is likely in the 7th or so.

No Way Home takes place in Christmas 2024, so 13 months after Endgame according to set photos.

&gt;WandaVision takes place no more than a week after, and finishes no more than a week later.

WV starts 3 weeks after Endgame according to Hayward and finishes 1 week later according to Darcy.

&gt;Falcon and Winter Soldier takes place God knows when, and does not seem in any way related to other projects.

FATWS takes place 6 months after EG according to Sam, so around March/April 2024.

&gt;Multiverse of Madness seems to connect all of them, and since it takes place right after Endgame (we can only assume)

Daytman,"I 100% do not think that is Stephen Strange. Here is what I am going off of.

1. Close to the last time we saw him, Dr. Strange had a moment similar to what happened to Tony in the Avengers. Tony saw the other side of the portal and it set him into the frenzy of building suits in Iron Man 3. Strange saw millions of possible futures, THE MULTIVERSE, and we expect him to walk around in a ruined Sanctum in winter clothes granting wishes? Which leads me to.

2. Dr. Strange walking around a ruined Sanctum granting teenagers' wishes. The vibe of this seems off completely. Not only is it not like the Strange we know, but it has very much the feeling of Thor returning to Asgard and finding Loki has taken over. Something just doesn't feel right about it. Plus, Wong saying ""don't do this spell"" and peacing out seems like it's missing Strange *compelling him* to leave.

3. The theme of the villains of the Holland Spider-Man trilogy is facing the Avengers' demons. Taking over New York cleanup from the Vultures company, Tony embarrassing Mysterio. Why would they pivot in the third act? The conflict of this movie should be caused by something the Avengers, and more appropriately Tony, did.

4. The shift from ""I'll do the spell"" to ""Peter how could you want to do the spell."" It's obviously the switch from before and after the reveal of the villain. Strange has a whole speech about how Peter's double life affects those around him... why should he care?

5. There just seem to be straight up scenes of Strange fighting Peter.

So, where does this leave us? I'm not sure. A prevailing theory is that a Kang variant is in every movie. Could this be a Kang variant adept at magic trying to take Peter out before his plan is foiled? Could Strange have already meddled in the multiverse and this is a more malicious version? I don't really have a good answer that satisfies point 3.

My current theory is that Shang Chi and No Way Home happen during Multiverse of Madness. Or at least, the general events start before Shang Chi and No Way Home. Strange is researching the multiverse and gets in over his head and gets captured and switcherooed by someone who wants to teach Peter a lesson. Again, don't have the comics knowledge to know who this would be.

Pie in the sky theory is Wanda already went to Strange for help, he tried to stop her from meddling in the Multiverse (ACTUALLY in character for him), and she didn't like that so she has imprisoned him and is trying to cause nexus events to shatter the multiverse and bring her children back. So Wanda AS DR. STRANGE is the NWH/ possible MOM villain. The final act will revolve around Peter rescuing Strange to stop Wanda.

Possible way this satisfies point 3: Wanda is upset that Tony got a funeral and Vision was relegated to weapons research.",ha52yvk,t3_paj4nz,/r/marvelstudios/comments/paj4nz/spiderman_no_way_home_trailer/ha52yvk/,63,marvelstudios,False,1,2021-08-24

grnmosrs,"Sony has no vested interest in making “good” movies. Disney does. Sony wants a cash cow. As NWH is the first film under the renewed contract I hope they don’t mess it up.

Sony is a poorly run studio. They’re holding on to the last cash cow they have. They can write movies for themselves. Tobey fans are blinded by nostalgia and are just as bad as Snyder fans. If Tom leaves the MCU, that will be worst thing to happen to the series so far. It’d be another stain on bob chapeks short stint as leader so far.

As someone who really likes the MCU Spidey- seriously, Homecoming is one of my top 5 MCU films- I’m getting a little tired of “Peter is an idiot and fucks things up” as a plot point. 

I was fine with it in FFH, because to Peter, Mysterio was trusted by Fury. I kinda get why Peter would trust him so fully. I’m sure it will be better handled in the film itself rather than a trailer, but the Strange/Peter scene really casts Peter in a dumb light.

ThorDiePie,"Not really. Tony had character development in his movies but is still a quipping asshole really.

Strange is still not the Sorcerer Supreme in the MCU yet. Yes, he learned that it's not about him after the ancient one but his ego and arrogance is still present even in IW, even clashing with Tony.

In Endgame he was just there to fight and bring the heroes so he was kind of stoic there only to point the 1 in 14 million.

After that almost all theories and speculations with WandaVision and Loki painted Strange as kind of the grand expert on everything, very careful and plans everything (which is so not him as a curious genius doctor) - will fix Loki and Wanda's mess and NWH hype had him as Peter's mentor.

I don't think we had a peek again at Strange's Character after his Movie. He's very talented in the Mystic Arts but still learning. That's why Wong is kinda bossing him around.

In a way, I’m wondering if there’s anything else huge or as climactic for the MCU Spidey franchise to build up to afterwards.

But of course, there are some ways they can keep building the hype in terms of antagonists if they want to up the ante. A Sinister Six comprised of **MCU Spidey villains** could easily work. A **gang war storyline** would be great if we want to go back to smaller stakes. **Smythe** could work if they want to do Spider-Slayers, or **Jackal** if we want to bring in clones.",hab2hwq,t3_pbdol0,/r/marvelstudios/comments/pbdol0/if_youre_worried_about_spidermans_rogues_gallery/hab2hwq/,72,marvelstudios,False,0,2021-08-25

Theory Description: 

I basically predict that from the Raimiverse (Spider-Man 2002), in the middle of Tobey Peter leaping to avoid the Goblin Glider's blades, Norman would get pulled out of his universe in that instance. Its the very moment in which Strange messes up the spell in the main MCU. 

In NWH, Norman spends a discernible amount of time in the main MCU.... and once the heroes beat him at the end of the movie, they punish him by sending him back to the moment he left the Raimiverse; just as Tobey Peter completes his leap and the blades come right towards him. 

No matter how much time he spent in NWH, Tobey Peter wouldn't have known where he went. It was barely half a second for Tobey to ever notice what had happened.

Thus, Norman's fate in SM1 is and always will be sealed.",haccy7x,t3_pbkkhf,/r/marvelstudios/comments/pbkkhf/theory_is_this_how_goblin_enters_the_mcu/haccy7x/,44,marvelstudios,True,0,2021-08-25

Explorer_616,"I think that kinda stuff will come with growing confidence:

In Civil War he was amazed of alll the heroes he met (and probably firghtend of those he had to fight) and compensated that with quipping and talking. A lot.

In Homecoming he had build up quite the confidence. Until he f\*\*\* up at that Ferry situation. Then he was a bit more carefull and acted a bit more focused.

In IW he was probably just out of his mind (imagine a 16 yeqar going to space all of a sudden and meeting aliens and all). On top of it, he tried to prove himself a lot to Tony during that time, so that's why he probably toned down on quipping.

In Endgame he had a rather small apperance, but because it was the end of the world, he was in serious Spidey mode, although a bit overhelmed again.

In FFH, he gained a lot more confidence again. This can especially be seen during the cut restaurant scene. He quipped and he had quite a good time. Taking down those robbers probably became a little bit more routined. But there was also the legacy of Iron Man stuff and him still processsing his mentor's death. So he toned down a bit again. And at the end of the movie he was in complete serious Spidey mode and he was quite angry, too (at himself for being stupid enough to trust mysterio in the first place and at mysterio for betraying him).

Now in NWH with his secret ID out in the open, he probably won't quip too much at first, since he's still stressed out about that. Then when he meests the other villains he'll probably realise how dangerous they can be and won't be too much in a quipping mood either. If he meets the other Spider-Man he'll see them in action and probably also hear them quip. So it's enterily possible that Tom's Spidey will pick up some traits from them and after defeating the Sinister Six will have gained enough confidence to be more quippy in the end.",ha9rxbx,t3_pb01uv,/r/Spiderman/comments/pb01uv/andrew_garfield_had_the_best_quips/ha9rxbx/,15,Spiderman,False,0,2021-08-25

sharklair,"So I saw a lot of comments theorizing the reason why Alfred Molina's Doc ock is saying Hello Peter in the NWH trailer when he obviously doesn't know Tom Holland's Peter Parker.
Most people believe he is addressing Tony Maguire and Marvel is doing its usual bit in manipulating trailers different from how the movie turns out. 
Some people believe Tom Holland is transported to the Raimiverse and for everyone else he looks like Toby Maguire.

What if? In our MCU uncle Ben is someone who looks like Doc Ock. Then it makes sense for Uncle Ben to recognize Tom's Peter.

Theory Description: 

I basically predict that from the Raimiverse (Spider-Man 2002), in the middle of Tobey Peter leaping to avoid the Goblin Glider's blades, Norman would get pulled out of his universe in that instance. Its the very moment in which Strange messes up the spell in the main MCU. 

In NWH, Norman spends a discernible amount of time in the main MCU.... and once the heroes beat him at the end of the movie, they punish him by sending him back to the moment he left the Raimiverse; just as Tobey Peter completes his leap and the blades come right towards him. 

No matter how much time he spent in NWH, Tobey Peter wouldn't have known where he went. It was barely half a second for Tobey to ever notice what had happened.

Thus, Norman's fate in SM1 is and always will be sealed.",hacdpbp,t3_pbko7j,/r/MarvelTheories/comments/pbko7j/theory_is_this_how_goblin_enters_the_mcu/hacdpbp/,7,MarvelTheories,True,0,2021-08-25

Strange is arrogant, yes. But not stupid. In IW (and the entire plot of his origin story) strange and the sorcerers are portrayed as the protectors of earth and reality. 

Should he do something arrogant like use forbidden spells or relinquish the time stone, it’s always to serve his one purpose: protecting reality. 

He literally admits he would let tony, himself, or anyone else die before letting thanos cause universal damage. So why in the world do people think it’s “in character” for him to do a favor for Peter that has MULTIVERSAL implications?

TimLuf1,"I'd like somewhat of a clean slate 

I reckon by the end of NWH Strange's spell will have worked and nobody will know that Peter is Spider-Man and essentially the lesson will be that he should be more careful with his secret identity in future. Responsibility etc. Maybe somehow MJ still knows? But most importantly no other superheroes bar Strange know about his identity, so that means that he's no longer tied to Happy Hogan et al. Only because it would be an ordeal to go through starting their relationship all over again.

In the next trilogy it should start with going to college and working with JJJ. He needs money and he wants to keep an eye so that JJJ doesn't sabotage him again. Also I think it would be really interesting if he met MCU versions of the Osborn's and Otto. Could be a cool conflict, that he knows there are alternate universe evil versions of them so he doesn't know what to do. Maybe he could even be doing an internship with Otto like in the PS4 game. You could have them as supporting characters in the first movie while a smaller scale thing is happening, like a gang war between Kingpin and Tombstone maybe? Could be a good excuse for him to work with Daredevil as well

Anyway I would like for certain elements of the Spider-Man status quo to creep in.

LiuKang90s,"&gt; The studio's employees can say whatever they want. 

It’s the literal director of the damn film

&gt; Them sneaking SM4/ASM3 into a single movie is not happing.

Nobody said it was.

&gt; Individual arcs, past actions, and personalities of each Sinster Six will appear as what I describe as the lesser portrayal because one I have learned people at Marvel Studios can't keep such a story constant enough without hickups and two they never fully embrace the small threads to make it happen.

So basically, only because you think so. I mean this with all due respect, I’ll take the words of the people actually in charge of directing/starring in this unreleased film over a random cynical redditor. Seriously, I don’t give a shit what you personally think about it, 

This

&gt; NWH is Kevin Feigie's rush to the Sinster Six and to capatlized on the illusion of the Sony verse mergering with the MCU. Sony's verse context isn't relevant enough for people to watch it. Yes the Sinster Six comes from it, but in the MCU we don't need whatever context was left over to furthure understand them. Spinning off from the last place they were yes can happen. But no I refuse to believe their full on story and the personality driving it will go on. I accept disappointment in regards to NWH being their new beggings. I'm not accepting this film's two writers and 1 director to give Toby and Andrew new development like a sequel would normally provide either. At most I accept a crossover targeted at a fanbase who eats up Easter eggs, fan theories, and setups with hardly thought point into them.

Now the spell is going to work, but now that the multiverse is in play the variant versions of villains from TASM and Raimi movies that exist in MCU as regular people are gaining memories and abilities of their variant counterparts. For example, regular MCU Norman  Osborn gains the memories and becomes the Green Goblin of the MCU.

gnutestoam,"I might be in the minority here but i hope that the upcoming phases aren't filled with multiples of characters and endless new character introductions. As much as its fun to see a wide range of characters and to have callbacks to previous films, i think it'll quickly become confusing for the average viewer and more importantly lose any sense of realism or stakes if there's always another timeline to grab a character from or another hero to come in and save the day. 

I don't mind the spidermen returning because thats a hugely popular character, of which both actors had their time cut short. But i'd personally rather not see the x-men universe continuing while we get new x-men AND potentially 3 spiderman universes. 

I just hope that marvel continues to make decent quality movies which have some concept of stakes and doesn't get carried away with making an ever-expanding multiverse. I personally prefer smaller scale stories that don't need to be  hugely connected to the MCU and don't necessarily include world ending stakes (i do appreciate IW/endgame and the idea behind NWH though; i'm not saying completely backtrack on the multiverse but rather have a mix)",hagcwsb,t3_pc1dpx,/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/pc1dpx/gww_writer_says_that_the_foxmen_character_that/hagcwsb/,7,MarvelStudiosSpoilers,False,0,2021-08-26
CaptainChickenBake,"It's a good parallel that's existed since Homecoming (when he rejected Tony's offer), but it doesn't really highlight how they welcome/shun the spotlight. Instead it highlights how different they are/were in their approach to being a superhero. 

Tony was arrogant and egotistical and felt no one could challenge him as Iron Man. He even threatened fake Mandarin to come at him, not even thinking about how it could hurt Pepper. That doesn't mean he's not caring, but his weakness was always his ego. 

Peter is not like that and does not think himself bullet proof, and will always think of the safety of his loved ones first. With great power comes great responsibility. He wanted the spotlight in Homecoming more out of the need to do greater good as an Avenger, but realized by the end that the neighborhood still needs a friendly hero and that he's not ready for that yet. I think NWH will really end up highlighting the theme of dual identities and the pros/cons of it as its always been a core trait of Spider-man. Is the secret identity truly needed or is there another way?

We had such a great time, and I also don't remember a time that a movie made her cry more than the Gwen's death scene did. She can actually recognize the (incredible) soundtrack of that movie whenever I play it.

He's coming back in this movie and teaming up with the kid one and all"" and she was like ""REALLY? Is his girlfriend coming back too??"" and then I cracked up lol.

2. He is the same DS in the physical sense but see above. The mv doesn't split (fracture like a diamond) until during the events of this movie. That should put Loki ep6 in direct overlap with NWH.

vaginaplunger,"The hype for this movie is obviously huge, but I think there were other factors to it too. Tiktok boosted the views of this trailer (which wasn't the case for EG), it has one more YouTube (official) channel-companies promoting it (Sony Pictures + Marvel) via ads, and Endgame trailer kept stuff closely guarded to the chest (they were banking more on it being the sequel to IW's cliffhanger) and it didn't even have the full name - while NWH one had some mind-blowing reveals whether you follow the rumours or not.

Further NWH trailer leak built more hype for the finished one I think and people were waiting for the CinemaCon + DRPK announcement, while they released the EG trailer on some random day out of the blue. Not trying to diminish the NWH hype, just sayin I think there are more reasons to why the trailer performed so well. 

The second trailer will be really interesting though. Generally second trailers get lesser views than the first one (including IW&amp;EG, though EG 2nd trailer did overtake IW 1st one). However in NWH's case, with soo many big reveals boutta drop, there's a strong change the 2nd one might take the crown.

hushpolocaps69,"You’re right. SuperheroTheorists is 19-20 years old just out of high school while everyone else here is 30+ older. SuperheroTheorists obviously got his hands on the trailer from that VFX Artists (whose name I forget she must be German or something) but he obviously shared the trailer with his friends and either one of those friends posted the trailer, or one of his friends actually sent the trailer to someone else who wonded up posting the trailer. 






Meanwhile, you have people such as 3CFilms who straight up posted the image of Willem Dafoe during one of his videos during June (he must’ve included it for a millisecond and obviously made it small) and not a SINGLE person noticed it so he was fine. You bet your ass he would’ve had his YouTube channel terminated or at least close to being terminated or the video being taken down if that image blew up on the internet. I still can’t believe no one noticed considering he gets a good amount of views per video so someone was bound to notice. HOW did someone even notice that AS OF LAST WEEK?!?! I am so confused by that. 






Once the trailer leaked though, everyone all of a sudden just jumps on the hype train and shares their leaks. It’s actually quite insane to think about because they’ve been holding onto these leaks for 2-3 months or even longer than that and yet not a SINGLE person wanted to share anything. Either they were scared as crap considering how big NWH is, or they didn’t wanna ruin the surprise for anyone? 




Anyhoo, the 3 images of the villains is a completely different story obviously not connected to SuperheroTheorists, then the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield pics as well, etc… 





And whoever was responsible for those obviously didn’t get caught… but because both the VFX artist and SuperheroTheorists watermarked their full names on the video, they got fired and could easily face legal issues since leaking a trailer is a big deal (even if that wasn’t them). 






This is different than the Infinity War trailer as well, since that trailer was shown at an event so obviously that person wasn’t going to face legal issues but would’ve definitely had his account terminated, but with this case, someone legit recorded the NWH trailer in the studio which is very very bad (I think this is the first time something big like this happens too since we usually just receive photos).",halbsnt,t3_pcptb8,/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/pcptb8/daniel_richtman_says_more_leaks_possibly_came/halbsnt/,22,MarvelStudiosSpoilers,False,0,2021-08-27

Lemon_Tile,"I think Strange's prominent character trait/flaw is not recklessness or immaturity, it's an insatiable intellectual curiousity and inability to be told he can't/shouldn't do something. In IW none of those traits were challenged and the stakes were incredibly high so hear appeared to have grown past that flaw but I don't think that's the case. 

In the NWH, Peter tempts him with attempting a new type of magic and learning something that we know ""shockingly little"" about. On top of that, Wong tells him ""no"". Of course Strange takes the opportunity to try the spell, he stands to learn something and perfect his skills and someone told him ""No"". Every other time that has happened to Strange he's proved them wrong and a lot was gained from the experience.

So, I absolutely think his actions in NWH are in character. Just because he seemed more serious in IW, doesn't mean his flaws no longer exist, they just weren't challenged.",hakkbq5,t3_pcnayy,/r/marvelstudios/comments/pcnayy/the_duality_of_man/hakkbq5/,14,marvelstudios,False,0,2021-08-27

regmckie,"&gt;*For one thing, America Chavez feels tacked on to this plot.*

You literally cannot make that argument because you haven't read the script. *Could* she be felt ""tacked on to the plot""? Sure. But we don't know that. She could be a really interesting and pivotal character. None of us know that though because none of us have read the script.

&gt;*And the other being that having a vast array of cameos being gimmicks and from past films just makes it sound like this film will rely on fan service than actually being a cohesive story. If Marvel does such a big film already, then what's there to look forward to going forward?*

People said this about NWH and look at the teaser trailer. It's very clear that this is still Tom's Peter's story.

PhoenixSelarom,"For me its the wonkiness of Peter's age. When we meet him in Civil War he is 15 and that's the same age he is in Homecoming which is fine cause they take place 2 months apart. But then IW is 2 years later, Peter dies, comes back in Endgame and then 8 months later in FFH he is 16. Almost three years have passed canonically and biologically for him since we meet him but he only aged once. He should be at the very least just shy of turning 18 in FFH. Its weird too because NWH takes place immediately after and will presumably be his final film in high school so there's no reason he can't just be 18 like he should be by now.

Then there is the weird 8 years later tag after depicting events from Avengers which just doesn't make sense no matter how you count time. It should be 4 in universe or 5 going by real time based on release dates so I dunno where they got 8 from.",hapyk84,t3_pdc033,/r/marvelstudios/comments/pdc033/the_mcu_is_often_praised_for_its_continuity_but/hapyk84/,19,marvelstudios,False,0,2021-08-28

hushpolocaps69,"This is probably an unpopular opinion but I am 100% against the 3 trailer idea. You guys won’t believe me when I say this but I literally have not even watched the NWH trailer yet. I’ve only seen 1 second snippets or photos but that’s literally it, haven’t seen the trailer. The only reason why I know about it so much, is because everyone kept explaining the trailer to where I now know the gist of it. 





My original goal was to not what any NWH footage at all, but then I realized I’m going to watch Shang-Chi which means it’s inevitable that I’m going to see the trailer since I love previews, so now my goal is to watch the trailer for the first time as a theatrical experience. 





With the second or third trailer though, I will NOT be watching them. Im going to avoid them by simply skipping the previews at the movies and just walking in when the film starts, which hurts since I really love previews but oh well… but yeah that is basically it.




Again, I’m fine with images or descriptions but I simply don’t wanna watch any footage. Still haven’t watched the Eternals second trailer (crap I just realized that might play during Shang-Chi too…) but I also have been skipping Shang-Chi footage as well, such as when it pops up in a YouTube ad, clips, and I didn’t watch the second trailer so I still have no clue about the Abomination fight as in how it looks xD!",hanetli,t3_np6w3j,/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/np6w3j/spiderman_no_way_home_trailer_date_speculation/hanetli/,11,MarvelStudiosSpoilers,False,0,2021-08-28

laylawooley84,"Contrary to the idea that the last thing the multiverse villains remember is them being killed by their Spider-Man, I think they were plucked from their timeline from the moment in the final battle when they were actually ‘winning’. So, they just want to go back to their home universe and finish the job, but have no way to because a) they get imprisoned by Strange and b) even after escaping they dont realize they dont know how to go back home. Thats why they form a team to get their hands on some Stark gizmo (I think some plot leaks confirm it). This is because some villains like Ock, Lizard and Sandman were redeemed at the end of their respective movies, and the only reason they are bad in the context of NWH is because their redemption arc never happened. However, Sandman still realizes half way through how evil Norman is, and switches sides to help Spidey (We see in the trailer that he builds a wall of sand to protect spidey against Electro). I think Ock also turns. Lizard is a 50-50 because he might be too far gone at that point without no antidote in sight.

Maybe have a trilogy of him just doing street level stuff in college while expanding his relationship to MJ and having him meet people at ESU like Harry Osborn and Gwen Stacy, and then a third trilogy where he's an experienced adult on the caliber of something like Insomniac Peter Parker and it's a passing of the torch of sorts to Miles Morales who he mentors throughout said films as they work together Spider-Men-style, as it would wrap things up with the current MCU Spider-Man and perhaps tie things back to where he started as a mentee, now becoming the mentor to a new Spider-Man for New York",han3n67,t3_pcweta,/r/Spiderman/comments/pcweta/am_i_the_only_one_that_thinks_theyre_moving_too/han3n67/,6,Spiderman,False,0,2021-08-28

&gt;foxx and molina aren't the only official ones. willem dafoe is returning for green goblin, and THC for sandman. as for everyone else, we don't know yet.

it's really amazing how you retconned what you mean by ""not cast"". regardless, my point still stands. if you mean it by them not showing up, then you still mean that the multiverse villains will be played by the same actors from other movies, and that these actors who aren't confirmed to be in it yet will show up, which is still contradictory to what you say about Tobey and Andrew not being confirmed. and see here? you're choosing to believe Thomas Haden will return too, where did you hear that news? imdb certainly hasn't listed him as being casted for NWH, and odds are from whoever you heard this from are the same people who backed Tobey and Andrew returning.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;where does jb smoove say tobey's appearing then, huh?

let me put a transcript of the video here for you:

Interviewer: ""And last question for you, which Spider-Man are you excited to see Tom Holland share the screen with, Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield?""

JB: ""Tobey Maguire, of course, man.""

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;it's like you're choosing to think that they've kept it a secret because you just want tobey and andrew to be there, so you make up lies and fantasies for yourself. i know that's rude, but i've tried to be the least rude person i can in this ""discussion"" but you swore at me, and insulted me. it's only fair.

well, if you can't tolerate a little profanity (which, to be fair i only used to emphasize ""contradictory"", not as an insult) then i'll respect it and not include one here. whether you mean it or not, i don't make up lies and fantasies - i believe them because there's plenty of substantial evidence that backs them.

As for ""it not being part of a universe"", Batman has not been part of a ""universe"" since 1960s. This whole ""universe"" crap started in the 2010s. The character was doing fine then (financially and critically) and will do fine without a huge cash-cow universe. Oh and Joker (2019) was not part of a universe and made more money than ANY film in the DCEU.

And no, The Batman did have more views than GVK, GVK only had more views on YouTube. Nowhere else. So a Batman reboot that is a fresh-entry in the franchise, with an entirely new cast got 25M views in 24 hours, that too with only 25% footage shot for the film and you think that's terrible? What other DC films has done that?

crxsshiphop,"I have a theory about Banner appearing in Moon Knight.

Spoiler Warning:

In Shang-Chi we see Wong and Abomination fighting, we don't know why, seems to be a minor event just to tie Shang-Chi to the larger MCU. In the mid-credit scene we see Shang-Chi recruited by Wong with Bruce and Carol present. It is assumed he is recruited to the Avengers, but what if the MCU is beginning to establish their own version of The Defenders?

We are seeing an increasing amount of mystical or supernatural IPs being introduced to the MCU. Blade, Werewolf By Night, Moon Knight.

In the NWH trailer, we can see Wong traveling somewhere with eastern architecture, maybe he's traveling to Budapest because some sort of mysticism caught his attention. Mysticism caused by an event in Moon Knight.

I wonder if Wong has established a team and he's traveling to Budapest with Banner to recruit Moon Knight.

This ""Defenders"" team would consist of:

Hulk
Moon Knight
Wong
Shang-Chi

antoniodiavolo,"For this movie, I doubt it. 

We already have one Goblin in this movie and two in general would be a bit much, such as having Dane DeHaan reappear.

Also, this movie clearly has a lot going on already and having Peter's best friend turn out to be a villain is a little much to also include in this movie. They totally could but I can't see it being done super well.

I did have an idea for how they could use Hobgoblin in a future movie:

Basically, some time after the events of NWH, Peter meets Hobgoblin for the first time. Having met a goblin-themed villain from the Raimi-Verse before, he immediately suspects that it's his universe's Norman Osborn. 

However, no matter who he tells, everyone thinks he's crazy. Norman in the MCU is a respected CEO/Politician. And maybe Peter meets him and thinks ""This guy is nothing like that multiverse Norman. Maybe I'm wrong"".

Maybe there could be an action scene where Hobgoblin attacks an event that Norman's at and threatens Norman, further disproving Peter's theory.

Later in the movie, he finds out that Hobgoblin has been Ned all along.

But then later, we find out that Peter **was** sorta right about Norman being Hobgoblin and I could see one of a few possibilities as to how.

1. He was in the Hobgoblin suit at first but once Peter got on his trail, he lured in Ned under the guise of an internship or something and brainwashes him into becoming the Hobgoblin. Maybe then Peter could fight Norman in the Hobgoblin suit. Or maybe Norman lies Peter that he was one of several people brainwashed into putting the suit on and he doesn't actually know who's responsible.
2. He was never actually in the suit and had Ned brainwashed from the beginning. He just supplied the equipment. With this option, you could set MCU Norman as a sort of Lex Luthor/Kingpin type where he's responsible for creating/assembling Peter's villains but doesn't get his own hands dirty.

This is just an idea I had so that you could introduce Norman into the MCU and have it make sense given that Peter knows that the Raimi Norman becomes evil while also incorporating Ned's Hobgoblin.",hap6720,t3_pd3uoi,/r/Spiderman/comments/pd3uoi/so_if_green_goblin_is_confirmed_for_nwh_does_that/hap6720/,2,Spiderman,False,0,2021-08-28

Joshawott27,"I think a huge issue, is Spider-Man No Way Home is really overshadowing both Shang-Chi and Eternals. NWH is playing to fans desires with the multiverse, returning classic actors, and a good ol' team up of established, fan favourite characters. It's what a lot of fans want, and the rampant speculation is prime fodder for clickbait articles that add to the hype machine. So Shang-Chi and Eternals just aren't on a lot of peoples' minds, as Spider-Man hype is filling their airwaves.

Personally, I think Eternals looks absolutely incredible from the trailers, and I really want to see it. Shang-Chi though? The marketing just isn't speaking to me tbh. Also, while I was confident in returning to cinemas for Demon Slayer and The Suicide Squad, the rise of the Delta variant happening at the same time that cinemas in the UK have dropped social distancing measures, is making me debate whether I actually want to risk going back to the cinema any time soon.

Jameson can be pissed he was unable to get Spidey locked up so he turns to funding the project that turns Gargan into Scorpion. As for Kraven, the events of NWH can cause him to realize that Peter is a worthy creature for him to hunt, with him bringing Chameleon along to help him.

Thiknutz,"i kind of hope not tbh. i feel like crossovers (and multiversal stuff in general) are gonna become very convoluted soon. i mean, i cant say that the NWH trailer didnt blow my fucking mind, but i think the multiverse should stay out of some things. it is kinda cool, but everything's got a limit. i think of it as similar to how in the 80s and 90s the big movie thing was time travel (bill and ted, back to the future, etc.), and in the modern day, that new big thing is easily the multiverse. all im saying is that eventually its gonna grow wore out and overused, if it isnt starting to already.

also, if they were to have peter parker in the venom movie(s), i'd prefer it be andrew garfield's spider-man, because it makes more sense canonically speaking and because the ASM and venom movies are similar in tone and aesthetic. just my opinion here but i think andrew garfield as peter parker alongside tom hardy as eddie brock is just perfect.",hatfk0n,t3_pdtsce,/r/thevenomsite/comments/pdtsce/do_yall_think_peter_parker_might_make_an/hatfk0n/,13,thevenomsite,False,0,2021-08-29

linebreaker-bot,"&gt;I don't hate tom holland in fact I like him as peter and spider-man but I just don't like the direction of his films are going (maybe except homecoming) especially how reliant he is on stark tech and how avengers level threat his enemies are and also how most of his enemies are stark's doing not even from his doing. I kinda want to see him grounded like showcasing peter's intelligence and creativity as shown in the comics like creating his own proper suit I really hate the overuse of the ""iron spider"" suit same goes with his enemies it's always been grand scale I mean his movie villains and consequences could even pass up as an avengers level problem or a global threat. For once, I just want to see him fight spider-man villains and have spider-man problems not go all avengers on us there's not a single movie of him without an avenger interference, I just want a friendly neighborhood spider-man taking down villains on a city scaled threat.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;And his overall development as a character felt underwhelming sometimes like exaggerated blown up into proportion scenarios with high stakes caused by low stake plot devices (edith) compared to the Raimi trilogy and Webb's duology, peter had more character development compared to tom has the past 6 films, his character still feels like he's on training wheels which makes me worry about his future on the MCU I really hope NWH changes that. Even spider-man homecoming just felt like a stepping stone, it was not a bad spidey film by all means perhaps it was the most grounded will possibly ever get from an MCU spidey film whereas Raimi had a more confident and established take for the character's universe, though their portrayal of peter and spidey was far from perfect but atleast peter had more independency for his problems whilst slowly learning and maturing not to mention the passion the producers had for spidey in the making of those films compared to what we have in the MCU today I just felt MCU's take on spidey got lazy.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;MCU spidey just don't feel like the definitive spidey despite having the age advantage and perfect balance on spidey and peter's portrayal. (i'm posting this on three subs btw cause i'm curious to hear as much thoughts from others as well incase you see this post again not here for the karma)

FreemanCalavera,"Who could the hinted sixth mystery villain in NWH be?

The most logical choices would be Vulture or Scorpion. Both are canon to the MCU (semi-canon for Scorpion, Mac Gargan exists but it's unclear if he's become Scorpion yet). Vulture is one of the OG Sinister Six members, but he's in prison currently (Gargan too tbf) and actively withheld Peter's identity from Gargan, so he might have had a change of heart. I also don't think they would re-use a villain from the first film once again for the third.

The most high profile choice of course would be to bring in Tom Hardy's Venom. Bringing in one of Spider-Man's greatest nemesises would certainly be a big threat, and Hardy's been highly outspoken about wanting his Venom to face off against Holland's SM. There is of course the issue of Sony vs. Marvel/Disney, but it's been rumored that Holland will appear for a cameo in Venom 2. Maybe NWH ends with him being transported to the Sony-verse, and that's why they've delayed Venom 2: to not spoil the ending of NWH. Then again, they seem to be positioning Venom as more of an anti-hero/hero who is just a little more brutal, so it doesn't really make sense for this incarnation to be a full-on villain á la Spider-Man 3.

Fabulous_Car_2024,"LOKI introduced us to a large load of information about multiverse and how these multiple realities interact with each other. For my theory, I will not be bothering anyone with details from comics and other sources outside the accepted norm of MCU. Loki hence forth in this post will refer to the show Loki and not the character Loki unless stated otherwise.

First instance of a possibility of multiple reality can be traced to endgame when we see there are 2 ""copies "" of the same character in the same reality. But as per Kang, this was meant to be and not a part of the ""multiverse"". 

Thereby, I assume that multiverse only came into our knowledge in events of loki and everything that happened before this is part of a single universe.

Some basic rules that Loki established is as follows

1. Characters can and may look different from their counterparts from different universes.(different loki characters in Loki)

2. Characters can and may have different ages.(kid loki,old loki)

3. Characters may be ""good"" or ""evil"". And this can and may vary universe wise.(hank Pym)

4.Same character can and may be with different abilities.(Tchala- the starlord).

5.Laws of physics in all worlds are the same.

6.The multiverse only seems to occur under two circumstances:

a)Nexus events (which can be undone by pruning)

b)Time Travelling while carrying an infinity stone (which can be undone by returning exactly it where you got it) .
7. MORE TO BE ADDED.
 
Now these can be used to justify that Tobey-spidey, TASM along with other characters from those films can come in NWH. That also means old aunt may may get to see hot Aunt may🙃.

My general interest in the MCU has plummeted as they have diversified their scope and platforms.

FartHead2018,Pretty much agree. I do like the idea of Spider-Man being the little cleanup crew to Stark's messes and I wish that could've been more emphasized and expanded upon before he died. My only hope is that he gets actual villains more tied to himself in NWH (unfortunately it seems like no). I just want a villain tied more to Holland's Spider-Man than someone else eventually.

MyMouthisCancerous,"I see the SSU functioning more like standalone stories that are acknowledged by the MCU Spider-Man films rather than being actively integrated into the same fold

Like it wouldn't make sense for Sony to pull out of the Marvel deal now. Attaching Spider-Man to the MCU was probably the biggest and most positively received financial decison they made for the longevity of the film franchise and it looks like Marvel and Sony are clearly on good terms if Marvel Studios is allowing Sony to basically set their non-Spider-Man projects in sort of a ""loose canon"" bubble that is acknowledged by the future solo Spider-Man films in the MCU. They're likely going to renew after NWH comes out because regardless of hardcore Spider-Man fan reception to that version of the character, the money and the general audience reaction to those films is more than enough for Sony to stay on-board working with Disney on these films.

So basically no. The future Holland films will probably also be 100% MCU while the SSU films simply tie into Tom Spidey's films.",haug3li,t3_pe2uc0,/r/Spiderman/comments/pe2uc0/do_you_guys_think_the_next_trilogy_of_movies_will/haug3li/,2,Spiderman,False,0,2021-08-29
