madog20x,"This is my guess on the plot. The movie will start with Bruce Wayne in retirement due to the death of Robin at the hands of Joker.  This will also explain Joker being in prison during Suicide Squad.  He will come out of retirement to take on Superman whose image has been (unknown to Bruce) heavily tarnished by Lex Luthor.  Meanwhile, Lex will use Zods body to create Doomeday, who he will present as a non-alien protector of Earth, but really he wants to conquer the planet.  Lex will lose control of Doomeday who will cause more damage than the Zod v Super fight, causing Batman and Supes (and other Superheroes) to team up and beat (though not kill) Doomeday.  This will also restore Supes superhero cred and form ""Dawn of Super Friends in Dark and Serious Toned Pallette"".  I watch too many movies.

EDIT- A bunch of people have commented on my hypothesis that Doomsday will be created from Zod's body.  I only believe this because Zod's body is in the trailer, and it's been announced that Doomsday will be in the film.  No, this isn't related to Doomsday's comic origin, but that origin has completely changed in various versions of the character, and I doubt they'll use his comic origin in the movie (but who knows).  Zod's body likely serves some purpose, but I may be way off on a Zod/Doomsday connection. ",ct00zkj,t3_3cxt0o,,676,movies,,,2015-07-11

Alfred is SPOT ON! Jeremy Irons nails everythign about him.

Batfleck ? SUCK IT DOUBTERS/HATERS ! W'RE HAVING A ""That guy from that faggot movie? pffft yeah right..he'll suck"" flashback with Affleck..

Luthor.....I had high hopes for him...he is arlight..but..I am not seeing an evil megalomaniac in this trailer..I'm seeing a wealthy kid with ambitions...but I guess that's what they were going for...this is the best trailer I've seen...references, easter eggs and what not and yet they still don't say too much....

Jord-UK,"You're wrong if you think I want a safe film. I want a cyber/neonpunk Batman Beyond film which would never get funded because it wouldn't be safe. I'm not going to see F4, not because I think it's too different from original F4, but because F4 isn't interesting to me. But I have always been fond of the Marvel and DC universes and I believe I know how those franchises should be handled.

What DC are doing with Batman V Superman isn't a safe option, despite having 30+ year old source material, they're going to have DC's two biggest names punch the shit out of each other but it's exactly what fans want to see. It's homage to one of the best graphic novels ever written and it could very well be a classic if it is pulled off well. Marvel haven't had one iconic fight yet and that's why you can call them safe. ( Civil War should sort that out though.)

I don't get how you can be tired of fans.. Fans are the only reason these films get to be made because without them, these characters would have never took off.",cszd3gj,t3_3cv0eu,,13,movies,,,2015-07-11

And most importantly, context. This comic and Watchmen (obviously more too, but these are arguably the most popular) were pretty much the starting point of modern, darker comic books in contrast to the goofy stories from the golden and silver ages.

Think about it, up until 1985 (one year before TDKR came out) we still had stuff like [""Super Friends""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqRxWAqnQ_g), the change was HUGE and this comic pretty much defined today's Batman.",ct03tun,t3_3cydkv,,9,batman,,,2015-07-11

stuartrmarshall,"I can see the merit in what you say, but to be honest I'd be far more in favour of a Wonder Woman fight against a ""turned bad through misguided trust of Lex"" Superman, than I would be Batman vs Superman. It would possibly make sense for Batman to assist Wonder Woman in this case. 

At least the former would make more sense as a legitimate fight. I'm still struggling to see how they can pull the latter off properly, given the powers we now know Superman has from Man of Steel. 

The only way to have the two good characters fight would be for Superman to pull their punches or for Superman to be significantly underpowered. If that's the case, what's the point of an actual fight on screen? 

If they are seriously going for the ""drama"" angle (which they sort of indicated but then botched in Man of Steel) then I hope they play up the intellectual side of the argument more than the fight.

Now, I've just noticed that the above does sound all negative - I should add that this trailer is a significant improvement on the teaser, and I'm definitely looking forward to 2016! As much as Man of Steel was an average-at-best movie, it's good that it's laid the groundwork for the rest of the DC roster to make their silver screen debuts in the shared universe.

Batman v Superman and Civil War in a period of a few months! This is going to be great.

It's a great time to be a fan of comic books and comic book movies. If we can just get rid of the childish DC vs Marvel factionalism, this will be another golden age.

DeliriousPrecarious,"&gt;What DC are doing with Batman V Superman isn't a safe option

I guarantee you that both BvS and Civil War are going to be incredibly safe films. Here's how you can expect both movies to play out:

* Act 1: Establish conflict between heroes
* Act 2: Heroes fight each other
* Act 3: Heroes team up to take down greater threat

The odds of Superman being Nixon's lapdog like he is in DKR are precisely 0. Similarly the odds of Tony Stark and Cap ending the movie with real animosity towards one another, where Cap is on the run (or dead) are also 0.

ninjartist,"For one thing, it's incredibly difficult. It really makes you realize how much advertising is out there. I had to divert my eyes from TV to subway entrances. I would also say that it can make the movie (more?) disappointing. I wasn't crazy about either TDKR or AoU, so it was almost like the movie I pictured in my head was better than what I eventually saw (it didn't help that I heard some of Ultron's menacing dialogue, and then he turned out to be sillier than I was expecting).  
  
I want to say it's still worth the effort, but I wouldn't know for sure unless I had seen one of my favorite superhero movies this way. Like, I wonder if I would've like The Dark Knight more had I skipped the trailers. I guess my lukewarm response to the previous two attempts helped me cave for Batman v Superman (not that I'm expecting to be disappointed). I guess I also don't want to miss out on the hype train, even at the risk of ""spoilers"" (I say that lightly). It's a tough call.

This Batman has been around for a while. The Alfred narration is clearly discussing something else. He says ""that's how it starts-"" as they are talking about Superman being too powerful.

FlyAwayStupidKite,"I'm hoping it'd be some sort of an ideology clash between Batman and Superman.

Superman in Man of Steel essentially took an uneasy stand with the government that he'll do what he wants and what he believes is necessary while trying to cooperate but not really.

In Batman v Superman, Kal-El probably is even more ""rogue"" and refuses to work with any sort of government so that his power won't be used for political purposes.

However, this probably causes a rift with not only the governments around the world but with the people as well. There are probably damages causes by his decision to stay politically neutral. 

So where does Batman come in?

Bruce Wayne is a retired vigilante who has also worked outside of the law as well.

He sees this new vigilante who's essentially a god unchecked. It's not human like he was.

He needs to show the world and show the new god that the god has humility. That he doesn't have to be with the government but he can't be above the people. He needs to comedown to their level if he wants to help them.

""Do you bleed?"" Batman asks the invulnerable deity. 

""You will."" He promises him. 

It's about breaking down the godliness of Superman and making him a man. 

He'll show that the superpower beings (Wonder Woman, Flash, Martian Manhunters) shouldn't be feared but thought of as allies.

He'll seem as a man who was out to take down the new gods only to truly reveal his master plan of gathering them together to use their powers for the greater good.

whatudontlikefalafel,"Man of Steel should have nothing to do with my analogy besides being the 1st film in this series. All I am saying is that the plot to a film like Batman v Superman is not that hard to follow. If it's ""convoluted"" because of the number of characters and set pieces, it's really not that bad. There have been films that deal with far more characters and events that have not been weighed down by their multiple storylines, such as Lord of The Rings which have multiple protagonists and antagonists being involved in different isolated events all at once.

Compared to The Two Towers, Batman v Superman has a pretty simple plot: Some people want to stop Superman, including Batman. They fight, become allies and stop Lex Luthor's plot. That's essentially the whole story.

Bruce has a flashback to his parents death? You can interpret this as them spending 40 minutes showing a new origin, or you can assume it's part of a less than 5 min. montage.

Argo has maybe three ""action"" scenes and I was still thoroughly engrossed by the film. You say exposition dumps, I say dialogue. I'd rather see people actually converse with each other than drop a one-liner between punches.",ct04kem,t3_3cxt0o,,3,movies,,,2015-07-11

GrimshadowENG,"I would have thought it would have been Dick's father, as the gravestone read 1952 - 2000 which means Dick's dad was 47 or 48 when he died. According to the DC Cinematic Universe wiki, the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents occurs in 1981 (A lot of things happen in 1981, including the killing of Harry Potters parents, writers and authors seem to love this year for being a bad year). Going by this information puts Bruce Wayne's birth in the DC Cinematic Universe around 1973/4. So, assuming Black Zero (AKA Man of Steel) (2013) takes place in 2013, Bruce Wayne is going to be around 41 or 42. Now, we can't tell for sure, but in the Trailer, Young Bruce's hairstyle would not have looked out of place in the 1970's or 1980's and adult Bruce looks like he's in his late forties. 

In short, whichever way you put it, Dick Grayson is not buried in that grave. That's not to say he hasn't been killed already, but that has to be Dick's father as if this were Dick Grayson, Bruce Wayne would have to be in his 70's, ala Batman Beyond, assuming he doesn't go the way of Endgame and brawl to the death with the Joker before dying in a cave.

The explanation is that suit could be Dick Grayson's as he could have died, and be buried next to his father or with Wayne's parents, but most likely, I think it will be Jason Todd's suit, and considering the whole diversity push in movies nowadays coupled with the homage shots in the trailer, I assume that they will take The Dark Knight Returns route with Batman and have Carrie Kelly be Robin, hence Jena Malone's casting, as she has worked with Snyder on Sucker Punch (which was more or less a glorified hour long music video, but it did have some spectacular scenes in it) 

TL;DR - That suit is in my opinion, likely to be Jason Todd's suit, considering the shared story elements with The Dark Knight Returns, the homage shots, the design of Batman etc.

As for how Robin will be approached... Well, probably not at all honestly. It's Batman V Superman. It's a movie about Batman facing off against Superman. It's not a standalone Batman movie. ",cszz7bs,t3_3cxxwm,,3,movies,,,2015-07-11

IgnoreMyName,"Thoughts on Superman v Batman aside (come on, really?), Batman looks dope but Wonder Woman does not. She looks more like a model than an Amazonian badass. Need some goddamn Ronda Rousey up in this mutha! Or simply, someone more Snu Snu than Adriana Lima.

One other thing, everything feels forced in this movie. Wonder Woman, Batman, the conflict... Unlike Marvel movies that came out one by one and have a strong story behind each character, they're going to have to explain where the hell Wonder Woman comes from, where was Batman during the events of the first movie, as well as WW, and the like. I feel DC is just rushing these movies out because of Marvel and I wish they didn't. I prefer DC characters over Marvel but I'm worried the entire DC universe is just going to be one rushed project after another.

Death_Star_,"It's going to be a 100% twist from the trailers. **Here is how the heroes will show up and deal with each other.**

**We are led to believe that Batman is hunting Superman on behalf of humanity.**

**In reality, it's Superman who hunts down this vigilante of Gotham. Those wanting to see Superman gone are mostly those who believe that Batman exists and is keeping Gotham safe -- basically batman groupies.** Batman is framed by the Joker to have killed Jason Todd/Robin, and Superman finds out about the story that Batman killed Robin, who was a friendlier superhero and one unequivocally on the side of good and revered by Gotham. 

As for the Man of Steel events, there were very few witnesses, and the word is that Superman is not just a god, but he's one who is able to kill the Zod that the entire planet knows of (he broadcasted himself). It's widely accepted that Superman saved the world from Zod, where both sides of the globe experienced the world machine damage. **But Bruce Wayne is skeptical as to Superman's moral compass, since few people know for sure that Superman HAD to kill -- and remember, this is Batman, who doesn't kill under ANY circumstance. Batman is incredibly concerned about this god who killed *another god*, meaning he could easily wipe out *humanity*.**

Batman is nearing the end of his career. He is going to pretend to get sloppy and provoke Superman and try a gambit to get Superman to fight him...to death. Batman has his supporters but they're in the minority, but if Superman actually kills a human without due process, he will be vilified and feared as a weapon that completely goes against both constitutional and natural laws...especially when they find out that Superman killed not only Batman, but Bruce freaking Wayne. 

Superman doesn't attack at first. But Batman has actually been working with Luthor for advantages, like krypton-tipped batarangs (we see the batarang scar/imprint on Superman's bare chest). Batman attacks and injures superman, looking like he's trying to kill him. Superman is starting to feel both 1) legitimately vulnerable and 2) that Batman is malicious. 

Batman is beaten to near death and waits for superman's killing blow -- again, that's Batman's ultimate gambit, to die and show Superman's bad side so that humanity rallies to shut him down --but it never comes. **Batman is now 100% assured that Supes HAD to kill Zod, as he would not kill someone trying to kill him but is no longer a threat (aka Batman, who nearly kills Superman, but is beaten to a pulp and can fight anymore, expecting death, but Superman exhibits restraint and never even considers killing him).**  

Alfred is glad Bruce is alive, and reassures him that Superman is indeed one of the good guys needed for the ""war.""

Batman is thus convinced that Superman doesn't kill unless lethal force is justified. 

As for Wonder Woman, she's the one who helps Batman, and when she is engaged in combat against Superman, Batman is using his Luthor-innovated weapons to try to attack Supes. Superman incapacitates Wonder Woman, and it's then that it's just Batman V Superman. 

As for Aquaman, he will get a cameo when the rocket launch in Florida (a place like Cape Canaveral) goes awry, and debris and half of the rocket are littered all over the Atlantic Ocean (if would make the most sense for him to be there, as it's in the middle of a bunch of major locations). 

In the trailer, we only see half of the rocket being caught by Superman, and it's only the TOP half, which means the BOTTOM part with the throttle is at large and missing. Superman traces it and sees the bottom half headed for a cruise ship in the Atlantic, and Superman is racing to chase it down to save the cruise ship....but Aquaman saves them from getting hit by manipulating the water to create huge waves and a mini hurricane, with the hurricane slowing the rocket and washing out the throttle, and the waves are creating a 60-foot wave as a wall to block the ship from impact. 

Superman arrives too late to save the rocket himself. 

After a stare down, with Superman floating and Aquaman standing on top of a 40-foot spurt of water that re-feeds itself, almost like he's standing on top of a million gallon burst of water driving up out of the ocean looking like a bigger version of a broken fire hydrant spewing water.  

Done staring each other down, looking at each other's good work, Superman and Aquaman have instant mutual trust, or at least respect. 

This Aquaman will have hydrokinetic abilities, and they'll tone down the ""I'm king of all ocean life and get fish and manta rays to help me out,"" which just doesn't work on screen and certainly doesn't work in the DCCU.  What we get is a warrior with superhero strength and speed and the ability to control water.  He *is* *Aqua*man and not ""marine biology man.""

We won't see the Flash. When Zod's body is being examined, Wally West is a lead forensic investigator and is the one who examines and researches Zod's DNA. 

We find out that Luthor sabotaged the rocket launch to get Superman to show up.  We find out that Lex helped both sides, Batman and Superman, to take each other out (Lex supplied the soldiers to Supes, supplied the weapons to Batman). Lexcorp gets a government contract to weaponize the krypton leftovers by reverse engineering....through Holly Hunter, the senator. 

Wally West is just not feeling like this is...Right.  Neither are the other heroes. Batman infiltrates Lexcorp to examine what is going on as Wally is working on Zod, and Wally is on Supes' side and opposes Batman.  Again, we won't see the Flash, but that big yellow explosion that was made to look like Wonder Woman created it was an incident at STAR labs granting West powers. The most we see is West's POV on a certain action scene, with everything moving slowly, with vintage Zach Snyder slow motion action to be put in even slower, higher frame rate use. Wally knows he has increased reaction time but hasn't figured out that he can run fast...yet. 

We find out Luthor has fingers in all sorts of pies, from corrupt politicians to corrupt businesses to conspiracies and illegal testing and inventions, including weapons of mass destruction. Lex loses his hair via chemotherapy through too much time spent with kryptonite radiation, giving him accelerated cancer. This is why he seeks Zod's body - he wants to see what is in the kryptonian DNA that allows them to withstand kryptonite radiation, even if it weakens them when yellow sun rays are mixed. The brief shot of the Asian lady is Lex's personal oncologist.

doesntgetthepicture,"I agree, to me the best part of the relationship is their absolute trust in the other.  Their camaraderie is far more interesting than their struggle.  Their independent philosophies towards crime, human psychology and the human spirit maybe different, but at their core they are both two neigh uncorruptible people fighting to make the world a better place the best way they know how.  The fact that their philosophies come into conflict isn't enough to bring them to blows, rather it suits them as their strengths and weaknesses balance each other out.

And they never just lash out.  Batman especially is methodical in his approach towards crime, while Superman tries to find the best and  most peaceful solution even in the midst of battle.  Outside of mind control, or an alternate reality where Superman is a government stooge or batman becomes a facist (or lois dies, or all hope is lost or some other extreme to break character), there is no reason for them to ever fight.

Argue, all the time.  Fight, really never.

He is now pretty much pissed off. He sees Superman as the one who is to blame for the destruction of Metropolis, and he'll want to stop to him. Bruce/Batman's arc is absolutely going to be the most compelling aspect of Batman v Superman in my opinion. 

Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor is the one I worry about, as he seems a bit campy from the trailer, and I don't know if it'll work within the tone of the film, but I hope they prove me wrong. ",ct0yigg,t3_3d109g,,12,movies,,,2015-07-12

Shell-of-Light,"Bullshit. They in no way were planning on making Batman V Superman at the time, or even using MoS as the basis for a DCCU. They've stated so publicly multiple times. 

It's simply smart writing facing the issue head on.",ct13ipu,t3_3d1kml,,11,batman,,,2015-07-12
TwitchyCookie,"The story is based off an animated movie and comic book called ""Dark Knight Returns"". Basically, by the end of the movie, Batman and Superman will team up and create the Justice League. In basic terms, it's a team of superheroes like the Avengers. This movie is setting up for a future Cinematic Universe where, like Marvel, a bunch of superhero films will share the same continuity and then be able to crossover with one another. 

As to why Batman is trying to fight Superman? After Man of Steel (2012), everyone begins to hold Superman responsible for the destruction of Metropolis when he fought Zod. Batman then comes in to take him out. It seems like he suffered personal loss from the battle (family was killed) and is now out for revenge.

Batman does in fact, stand a chance against Superman. Batman is known for being a master strategist and can adapt to many situations. He also has the resources and intelligence to buy something such as kryptonite. There's a story called Tower of Babel where Batman has plans in place for everyone in his OWN TEAM AND HIMSELF in case they betray him. [Narrated version can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJVvrmLSTsg)

Another way Batman can beat Superman is that he's not afraid of scaring people either. He could find out Superman's Clark Kent persona and threaten to release it out to the public unless Superman left him alone or does what he wants.

Batman is usually more smarter and experienced while this Superman has only had one major battle and is reckless. This is also what gives Batman the edge.",ct0cihw,t3_3cz0hb,,10,OutOfTheLoop,,,2015-07-12

doctorpwn,"Clark Kent, an average journalist, is Superman, basically a god.

 Bruce Wayne, a genius, martial artist, and rich guy, is Batman, a crime-fighting genius, martial artist, and rich guy with cool toys and a mask.

The whole Batman v Superman thing is that Batman is a man, going up against Superman. Batman represents humanity. But it's cool because Clark Kent's boss tells him nobody cares about Clark Kent taking on the Batman...

Very much excited for Arrow and Flash, Arrow in particular looks like it will have lots of improvement.

medros,"So, my overall thoughts on the panel that have been snuck out, and the overall treatment of the fans of the Warcraft franchise. I won't lie, I am excited for this movie. I saw the securely screened footage that was able to be watched by attendees only at Blizzcon last year, and I got excited, and then even more so when I stepped out and saw props on display. 

For three years now, Legendary has shown what I feel is a great disrespect for the fans of this franchise. For three years they have done these hype killing reveals at SDCC, and last year they had restricted footage at Blizzcon. They have, I feel, shot themselves in the foot and killed a lot of the buzz and excitement for this movie. The sad thing is that this movie likely wouldn't even become a reality if it weren't for the built in, millions strong playerbase of the game. Time and again when I have brought up the movie, the response has been one of boredom and lack of interest, purely because Legendary has done a horrible job of keeping the fans engaged. 

I understand the first mistake was likely Blizzard's, as they should have in no way announced the plans to do this movie so very early in the process. By the time this movie is released, it will have been over a decade from the announcement that it was going forward, and that is a long time to leave the loyal fans champing at the bit. 

Then, 2 years ago, when the movie felt like it was making some real headway, Legendary showed the first concept for the movie, but only to SDCC fans. For a Warcraft fandom that was waiting for 7 years to have any real, tangible evident the movie would actually happen, this was both exciting, but a slap in the face, because only those who could a) get to San Diego, b) get a ticket for SDCC, and c) get into the hall where the presentation was happening, a feat upon a feat upon an even greater challenge let me assure you, were able to see it. Exclusive? Yes, to a fragment of a percent of the community, even in the unlikely eventuality that every person there was a Warcraft fan, and not just waiting for a later panel. 

Then, last year, there was rumor, since filming had wrapped, that there would be actual movie footage. Every video from the panel has the footage edited out, likely at the demand of Legendary, so once more a slap to the face of the fans of this franchise, as once more the footage was unavailable to the wider public, and more fans lost interest in the movie. Then Blizzcon last fall came, and they happily announced that there was a Dolby Atmos theater set up for folks to see some processed film footage at the convention. It was great, but trying to see it from the eyes of the many fans, a lot of them friends of mine, that I encountered who could not be there, could not see that, I was saddened by this restriction, and felt like more people pulled back. 

Now, we come to today. Legendary has once again taken great measures to make sure no one can see the footage. The weird thing is other movies coming out next year have plenty of footage available. Star Wars: The Force Awakens released its first teaser over a year before its release date. Batman v Superman had its first teaser just under a year before its release date. Yet we are now told that while ""Legendary really believes in this movie, so they are making it their summer blockbuster"", they don't have enough faith it can keep excitement more than 7 months, or so it seems. 

I have been playing this came since its original beta. I have been playing in the Warcraft universe for more than half my life, and friends I am not young. I am sad that Blizzard have maintained so little control over this project that they can't even insist that this type of footage be released, so that all of the fans, old, new, and ones yet to come, can see. I know this is Hollywood, but it seems even Legendary are unique in their actions when it comes to movies they allegedly believe in. What does this feel like to me? A fourth slap in the face to the fandom, that we have to wait 4+ months until Blizzcon or later to see the trailer that was shown to thousands at SDCC today. 

My wife works in daycare, and she tells me, on occasion, about how she was trained to deal with petulant children. If a child misbehaves, because it wants things its own way, you discourage this by refusing to give them what they want. If a child wants to play with a certain toy instead of cleaning up like they were told, you take the toy away until they have learned their lesson. I think it's time that Legendary gets to see the result of ignoring the 'guaranteed audience' in favor of the general audience, and see how those tickets that should have guaranteed a release day sell out will feel if they stay home for a few weeks. I don't claim I have enough sway to cause this to be community wide, but I sure would love to see Legendary apologize for treating us fans as less because we are seen as a sure bet to fill those seats.

As for my show, I am seriously considering limiting our movie coverage of SDCC and Blizzcon to “there was a panel” until such time as the fandom in general, not just the exclusive panel audiences, are treated as worthy.

WNMLP,"Maybe it was part of WB's plan? You're assuming the whole reason the plot of Batman v Superman has something to do with Supermans involvement in the destruction is because of criticisms. I believe they did plan it, for they're showing a more grounded and an almost real-world response to an alien showing up and destroying half a city and claiming they're a hero, rather than some other superhero movies that will rarely touch on the consequences of superhuman conflict.

B3N15,"Usually through Batman outsmarting and exploiting Superman's weaknesses.  Examples are in the [Dark Knight Returns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDIR_e3XRKM), he takes advantage of Superman's weakened state via kryptonite/nuclear winter and fights him to what s essentially a standstill and in [Justice League: War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkFzXkpjXmM) he takes advantage of Superman's unwillingness to kill and knowledge of his secret identity.

One big thing to remember about Superman and Batman is that Superman is a muscle-bound farm-boy from Kansas with a bachelor's degree in journalism, he's a brawler that wins most of his fights because he's faster and stronger than anyone else.  Batman, on the other hand, is hands down one of the best tacticians and hand-to-hand fighters in the DC Universe.

arishd,"The Social Network: The main theme of the piano was just chilling but perfect for the tone of the movie. It accented the characters perfectly and brought more to the table. 

2001: A Space Odyssey: The epic scale of this movie was backed up by some of the most epic music to date. My favourite would have to be ""The Blue Danube"" By Johann Strauss when you first get into space. 

Man Of Steel: Lots of people are split on the film, NO one is split on Hans Zimmer's breathtaking score. From beginning to end it's scope and size never shrinks. 

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly: C'mon it's Ennio Morricone!! How can you go wrong with this, just excellence throughout. 

Inception: Another entry by Hans Zimmer. How does such a complicated movie has such a simple yet layered score. ""Time"" is not only my favourite piece of music but the timing of this was nothing short of excellent. 

Reservoir Dogs: Wouldn't be a music list without Mr.Tarantino and ya I could've picked ""Basterds"" or Kill Bill but this one just really hits the spot every time. From the opening with ""Little Green Bag"" all the way to the unforgettable ""Stuck In the Middle With You"", it's truly a marvel to listen to.

Mad Max Fury Road: A newer entry but very worthy, the epic scale and scope is matched with Junkie XL's pure talent.

The reason WB does not need each hero to have an individual film is because their heroes are far more popular than Marvel's.

ignore_me_im_high,"Well, people's problem wasn't that the destruction happened, it was the tone that was applied to the reactions of the characters once it had.

For example - Superman and Lois thinking that floating down upon a devastated Metropolis is the best time to have a romantic first kiss is more than a bit inappropriate.... like a lot more than a bit. That's just terrible writing that totally misses the mark.

Lois and Supes should have been aware of the destruction and had shared a true moment of compassion with each other over the lives that had been lost as they ook at the destruction and then each other. This would have shown them bonding in a much more genuine way that isn't contrived and then the fight with Zod that follows has been contextualised in a totally different way. Alas none of that happened and it didn't seem like there were any stakes.

SO no matter how good Batman v Superman is it will never make up for the flaws of Man of Steel.",ct0b5el,t3_3cxt5v,,2,videos,,,2015-07-12

Take a look at [this chart](http://www.rtings.com/images/optimal-viewing-distance-television-graph-size.png), the average living room has the couch at least 10ft away from the TV, you would need a ~78"" to even notice UHD 4K, and ~150"" to get the full resolution.  
  
4K media is also a factor, the majority of movies today are only 2K (1080p, but wider, like 21x9). Even blockbusters like Avatar and both Avengers are only 2K. Right now, 70mm IMAX (regular 70mm is hardly used) is the highest, at around 14K equivalent, but Interstellar is most likely the last movie in that format (both the new Star Wars and Batman v Superman were filmed partially in it, but it's too expensive, ~$850,000 to develop and ship.)",ct11tp1,t3_3d1vd6,,2,explainlikeimfive,,,2015-07-12

GrilledCyan,"&gt;Fair enough, but that still means that the movie HAS to take place AFTER Superman appears, and probably after Batman returns, so after the events of Batman v. Superman. Which STILL poses a problem in terms of time. THat said, though, I agree with everything else you're saying here.  
  
How so? Do you just prefer that the Suicide Squad already have been a thing in this universe, rather than cropping up right as the whole story gets going? I guess I can see that point of view, but I'll have to see the movie before I know how they handle it. Perhaps the emergence of the ""new threat"" at the end of BvS (like some kind of Lex funded militia?) is what Waller decides they need the Suicide Squad for. Only time will tell I suppose.  
  
&gt;Far as I can tell, he's still in there. Not finding anything from Zack Snyder debunking it. I'll keep looking, though. That said, if he appears, I'm not really happy about it either. Especially since rumors persist that Doomsday is being played by Michael Shannon, AKA Zod from Man of Steel. Which...noooooooo.  
  
Yeah, I really wouldn't want a Zod created Doomsday. Doomsday needs to be saved for a Justice League movie. He's a big enough villain that you'd need all of them to take him down. And if DC/WB didn't go that route, then they have to use the villains that are similar to the ones Marvel is already using (Darkseid/Thanos, Braniac/Ultron). I know they aren't totally similar, but still.  
  
&gt;Plus, like Heath Ledger did in The Dark Knight, be might supply some well-needed, psychotic-minded levity, and enjoyably over-the-top scenes, whilst also being extraordinarily menacing and subtle (somehow). Only time will tell, I suppose.  
  
That's my view on things. I won't judge casting choices after what happened with Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight. And while I know everyone is used to the animated, deep voiced and super buff Lex Luthor, I think this interpretation has a lot of potential. He can kind of subvert Luthor's normally cliched super villain persona.  
  
&gt;I'm really hoping this is the case. After all, they both have origins related to the ancient Greeks. Granted, Momoa's version is clearly meant to be Samoan (which I actually LOVE, to be honest), but they're still both from older societies. So, yeah, I hope this is the case. That's how Aquaman is brought into the League! Hal is brought it because Superman's activity has been getting a lot of attention from space, and Flash and Cyborg...yeah, I got nothing for them. Yet. Maybe they also ""came of of the woodworks"" after Superman's emergence, like the Suicide Squad characters.  
  
I think that has to be it. And I love the creative decision that makes the Atlanteans more Polynesian than underwater Brits. I feel like when the plot for Justice League gets going, Flash and GL show up to check things out, since they're heroes looking to help. I feel like we'll see the creation of Cyborg at some point during Justice League Part 1, to drive home the tragedy of his character (instead of doing it through flashbacks) and sell him as being the most human and relatable member of the League.",ct0jo40,t3_3cxt1i,,1,DCcomics,,,2015-07-12

MeaninglessGuy,"There's a problem with immediately releasing Comic Con trailers- they're not always finished.  They rush a lot of effects for Comic Con because they know that people are seeing it on dim screen, they're already uber-excited and won't notice/care due to the adrenaline they already have, and there is a bit a grace given from the audience.  If you release those same trailers online in that state- people will rip them to shreds for having bad special effects.  

Examples: Batman v. Superman was ready for prime time, but Deadpool (according to Ryan Rynold's twitter) needs a few more weeks of tweaking.  That's just the reality of making movies that rely so heavily on post-production visual effects- they are still working on the effects up until the movie comes out, so the pipeline for trailer marketing can be very delicate.

otusasio451,"NOTE: I just posted this in the original thread, but I figured I'd repost it here. And, with that:

______________________________

...You know what? I'm gonna do a recap of this one.

* The Suicide Squad is imprisoned in a vast underground complex run by Waller and the Government, as expected. The only people we actually see imprisoned are Harley, Deadshot, Killer Croc, and El Diablo. 

* Waller's statements at the beginning indicate that this movie takes place *after* Superman appears on the planet, which also means it takes place after *Man of Steel* AND after Batman's retirement. Not necessarily after his comeback in *Batman v Superman*, but definitely after he retires. Which is...interesting. Especially considering Joker's appearance in the film. I'll elaborate more on that later, but I'm not entirely sure his scenes take place in the modern day, ESPECIALLY sondering his interaction with Batman, and what we know about Joker from the *Batman v Superman* trailer.

* The trailer appears to give us a glimpse of the Enchantress' origin. We se a seemingly normal Cara Delvingne in a cave, then see her later immersed in a black liquid underneath an upside-down, seven-pointed star. Since the heptagram was used in Christianity to ward off evil, we can probably assume an upside-down heptagram is used to bring evil near. So, yeah, Enchantress is gonna be...interesting. We later see the Enchantress in full costume, with the moon on her head and some such.

* Deadshot appears to be very close to his daughter, as he is in the comics. This is most likely going to be the driving force behind his character. We'll see what becomes of it, though.

* There's a guy in an eyeball mask shooting a gun. He is accompanied by a man in a goat mask. I know not what this means, but I'm intrigued. Maybe this movie's gonna be fun after all.

* We also see someone in a panda bear outfit, a guy dressed up as Batman (presumably wearing hockey pants), and several people with boxes on their heads. I'd assume that they're related to the eyeball and goat-heded guys from earlier, but I'm not sure that they're in the same location. So, either they're all together and laying siege on different places, or they're completely, inexplicably separate from each other. Either way...interesting.

* Harley's origin is...possibly...briefly glimpsed as well. We see her as a psychologist (at least, I *think* that's her), being tortured by the Joker, and then later see a severely damaged Harley in what appears to be a sewer or tunnel. I'm personally assuming that that's related to her origin, rather than the actual events of the film. Call it a hunch, but I'm willing to bet that the Harley we see in the present-day setting of the film is a little less damaged, and that Harley in the tunnel is far more damaged. We also see the Batman scene, with him riding on the Joker's car. This gets me to think that we're going to see a LOT of Harley's life pre-Squad. Same with ~~Deadpool~~ Deadshot, as these two are probably going to be the main characters of our film.

* And I almost missed this one. The panda bear and associated crew are all affiliated with the Joker. I know this for two reasons. One, the panda bear outfit is right next to Joker during one of the final scenes of the trailer. And two, he's seen walking through the factory that those guys are shooting up. It's a blink-and-you-miss-it shot, but he's clearly walking behind someone in that blue-lit factory. I'm willing to bet that the eyeball and goathead guys are linked to him as well.

* Something world-threatening might be happening in the film. I see this because of Deadshot's comment about ""saving the world,"" and because the stuff with the Enchantress looks pretty heavy. Should be interesting, either way.

* One more thing: the Batman chase scene starts with Harley in what appears to be a dance or strip club. I say this based on her dress. It's the same dress she wears in the car with Joker, as Batman rides on the roof. And again, I'm assuming this happens in flashback. We know Harley's imprisoned before she joins the Squad, so I'm willing to bet that all of this happens *before* that imprisonment. It's somewhat hard for me to believe that Harley hooks up with the Joker during the events of the film, so I'm inclined to believe that all of his scenes happen in the past, rather than during the current events of the film. However, his appearance in the shootout earlier may disprove that theory. We'll see as more footage and details emerge.

* Diablo's cell appears to be built to deal with his pyrokinetic abilities. We see him being flushed out of a water-filled pipe later in the trailer. They probably should have taken those kind of precautions (in intent, not type) with Harley, as she pretty brutally takes down one of the guards that enter her cell. Speaking of, I'm assuming that both scenes occure during either an attempted escape, or the intended recruitment of these characters into the Squad by Waller.

* And one more thing: Leto's Joker. This isn't a note about the character past what I've already mentioned. I just wanna say that my opinions on the portrayal are...mixed. I will say, I'm glad that he appears to be actually, fully bleached in skin color, rather than the make-up look. However, I'm not a huge fan of the tattoos all over, especially on the face. Nor am I a fan of the metal teeth he's got. I just...I dunno, I'm kind of a purist that way. But, to be fair, they do make some kind of sense. What better way to have a permanent smile than to have it be made of metal? And that leads me to the one thing I really like about this version: he honestly DOES look like the Joker. More so than Heath Ledger, even. That wide, lipsticked smile, the bright green hair, even the eyes, he just looks like the Joker! Sure, the tattoos throw me off, and I'm not a huge fan of the slow laugh, but he's still undeniably Joker and I'm looking forward to seeing more of him.

pottyaboutpotter1,"Can we take a moment to appreciate what a wonderful time for superhero movies this is right now? Next year we'll have Captain America: Civil War which will split the Avengers right down the middle and pit them against each other as well as rebooting Spider-Man, Doctor Strange which will take the MCU in a whole new direction with the addition of magic (since Thor favoured super advanced science over magic), X-Men: Apocalypse wrapping up the excellent ""First Class"" trilogy, Deadpool being... well... Deadpool, Batman V Superman pitting three of the world's biggest superheroes against each other and setting the seeds for Justice League and Suicide Squad introducing a new Joker, Harley Quinn and the Suicide Squad making it a superhero movie following the supervillains but keeping them as villains (and not making them heroes to fight a giant monster like Sony was going to do with the Sinister Six). 

It's just a wonderful time to be a comic book fan right now. Let's just ignore the fanboy ""Marvel vs DC"" wars and stop arguing over who's movies are going to be better and just appreciate that these movies are even getting made.

oldirtybaron,"The downside to Marvel's homogenized approach is that all of their movies look and feel the same. It's worked out so far because they've chosen to do projects that reflect the tone they want, but it also means you can't do a proper Daredevil movie on the big screen. Nor could you do Punisher, or a myriad of other ""serious"" characters.

DC's approach may seem a little serious, but I find that has more to do with WB trusting their directors/producers to find the appropriate tone for each individual work. Batman v Superman is looking downright operatic. Mythic, even. Suicide Squad is looking real gritty. I imagine if they do a Wonder Woman film, the tone will accurately reflect the type of story they'll try to tell there.

Neither approach is either good or bad by default. It comes down to execution, I find, and I think that they're doing pretty well so far.",ct24xge,t3_3d5z6l,,16,comicbooks,,,2015-07-13

In a previous film he played as the comedian in Watchmen. Both are from the same director Zack Snyder. 


With JDM playing the role of Thomas Wayne, fans are speculating that he will have a much bigger role for future films such as **Flashpoint Paradox** for a standalone Flash film. This speculation started when someone noticed a [painting](http://images.fashionnstyle.com/data/images/full/79942/jeffrey-jpg.jpg) with the resemblance of Jeffrey on the set for BvS. Fans pointed that they could cast anyone for the role of Thomas Wayne since his role is so minor but since the studio casted JDM, there might be a contract for him to appear in future films.

One thing that bothers me about The Avengers is the complete and utter destruction of a REAL city (Metropolis is still, for all intents and purposes, a fictional one) and the ability of the heroes to keep safe every single inhabitant of every single square inch of that Manhattan. They exaggerate it even more in Age of Ultron by managing to get every single sky-borne city inhabitant out just in time. I'm not hating on those movies at all, I loved them. But Man of Steel presented a real world with real world superheroes and real world consequences. You had to imagine that people were hurt or killed (as they would be in any superhero or action movie) and now, with Batman V. Superman, they are dealing with it in a realistic way. I think it was done very purposefully and beautifully.   

Also, from a storytelling standpoint, this is Superman's first encounter, so none of his rules were ""set."" He broke what seemed to be two established tenets of Superman, which should be taken as a reintroduction of the character, not as blatant ignorance.

rsdancey,"DC is trying to construct a shared cinematic universe like Marvel has. The only movie in that universe so far is Man of Steel but Batman V Superman will be in it and so will Suicide Squad. DC is building a roadmap of future movies that will share the same continuity but those plans are still pretty vague. The only thing I think is really clearly on that list beyond the two upcoming films is a Justice League movie.

pantlessben,"I see what you're saying. However, if they were honest with Superman's abilities, the conflict in the films wouldn't be fun to watch.

Conventional super hero movies need conflict. If that conflict revolves around choices and motives instead of around action, then you're no longer making a conventional super hero movie.

For instance, in Batman v. Superman, there **needs** to be a fight scene between the two heroes. In the trailer, Batman dodges one of Superman's eye laser attacks. Superman is capable of traveling beyond the speed of light... there is no dodging Superman ever, unless you limit him canonically.

Thus, the two choices for a conventional super hero movie are 1. inhibit Superman's canon for the sake of entertainment, or 2. move on to different subject matter. In my opinion, option 1 is fucking stupid unless you're going for the easy cash on a recognizable logo. So, Superman is now just a logo.",ct1cvwr,t3_3d2c9l,,5,movies,,,2015-07-13

He was then ressurected via Lazarus pit by Ra's al Ghul, because Ra's is a weird villain.

Upon resurrection Jason decided to be The Red Hood, the Joker's old disguise (allegedly). Jason became a soft anti-hero because he's bitter that Batman wont avenge him by killing Joker, but he's still a good guy at heart. He currently has a tenuously okay relationship with the bat family.

Karisma_not_Karma,"&gt; Welcome to the world of comics!

I swear this community is the nicest I've been a part of. (:

I actually loved the violence, but it's not what I was expecting at all. I finished up Young Justice recently and it was quite the departure from that. 

I thought about it some more after reading your post, and I *do* like this Superman more than the normal one. I like all three of the main characters a lot, actually, so I guess overall I did end up liking the movie. I went back and watched those three shorts that came out before the movie too. Superman's was easily my favorite.

I'm working my way through Justice League, then eventually the Batman and the Superman one. I watched some of Batman Beyond and Teen Titans when I was a teen, but only episodes here and there. I didn't even know there was a Static Shock show until today. D:

Here are those three videos, in case anyone wanted the links.

MooneySuzuki36,"These trailers are heavily influenced by a comic called Batman: The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. It is a famous story that is technically non-canon. It, along with others, were a heavy influence on Batman's return to crime fighting in Nolan's ""The Dark Knight Rises"". 

Basically in the comic Superman is a boy scout for the government and will do whatever they say. Batman, coming out of retirement, starts stirring up the criminals in Gotham and in doing so makes the government look bad that their authority is being challenged by a vigilante. They tell Superman that they might have to send him in to take care of Batman and make sure he doesn't make an ass out of the government anymore. Superman warns Batman of this but Batman doesn't give a fuck because he's Batman. 

Eventually Superman is sent in to take care of Batman. He really doesn't want to fight Batman and he is holding back the whole time. Batman gets the retired Green Arrow to shoot a kryptonite arrow at Superman. Batman then beats the shit out of him and reminds him to ""stay out of his way"" and that he should remember ""the one man who beat him"". In all honesty it's badass as fuck. Batman then has a heart attack and ""dies"". Really he is fine and faked his death so that he could operate a Batman Inc.-like operation from underground. Superman hears his heartbeat at his funeral and knows that Batman is still alive.

Batman is my favorite comics character and I spend way too much money buying and reading Batman comics but Batman only won in TDKR because Superman didn't want to kill him. In most scenarios Batman will lose to Superman. Batman will most definitely need kryptonite to even stand a chance. And does the ""Man of Steel"" Superman even have a weakness to kryptonite? That was never established and I am kind of curious on how they are going to do that.

Btw, here is the scene from TDKR Animated Movie:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDIR_e3XRKM   ",ct1a0u0,t3_3cz4d8,,4,explainlikeimfive,,,2015-07-13

alsorobots,"I have an even more messed up question.  Is the Joker still alive during the events of Batman v. Superman?  We saw him at the end of the Suicide Squad trailer torturing either Harley or Jason Todd or both.  No matter what, that's footage of the past.

Plus we saw the Joker's spraypaint message across the Robin uniform.  We also saw Batman snap someone's neck, granted not the Joker, but still, he crossed the line in either reality of his own mind. (that could be a dream sequence).

Is it possible that the reason the Batsuit and the Batcave look like they've been abandoned and those hateful stares combined with those odd lines from Alfred could be alluding to the fact that Batman killed the Joker at some point and hung up the cape?

I know, there's barely any evidence, but it would seem like that quick scene in the Suicide Squad trailer where Bats is on top of the Joker's car with Harley riding shotgun was set in the past, maybe years in the past.  Harley really seems broken as they approach her in her cell and there's zero Joker walking with the Suicide Squad in the now iconic street scene.

Thematically, it would line up with the attitude Ben Affleck has been taking with questions regarding the storyline.  He seemed to hint that it was much darker and more adult than Marvel storylines.

Plus, Supes killed someone in MoS.  Batman showing so much rage towards Supes could be because he crossed the line before and killed.  This may be a broken Batman and it could be Superman that saves Batman in the end.  

What do you think?

That being said, I hope the Joker is alive because the DCCU would be a boring place without him.",ct29wgn,t3_3d603x,,4,comicbookmovies,,,2015-07-13

BryanDowling93,"I'm really looking forward to this. This is something different, and something we haven't seen from a comic book film. This is an all villain film, only some are more evil (Joker) than others. David Ayer has experience in intense and gritty filmmaking based on Fury, so he's perfect for the job, and I hope he gives us something that feels unique. This has the absolute potential to be DC's best film regarding the shared universe, and I think it will, as Batman v Superman will be very solid, better than Man of Steel, but Suicide Squad has a more crazy and unique feel to it, and I feel people will be talking about Suicide Squad more than Batman v Superman at the end of 2016. Cast looks perfect (even Jai Courntey, and I normally don't like the guy, but he seemed fine in the trailer), especially Robbie (Harley) and Leto (Joker), who are fantastic based on the trailer. Will Smith is a star, and he will bring in some people. He has a screen presence, and he looks right for Deadshot. I'm stoked for August 2016, and I have a feeling this will be not disappoint, as I have faith Ayer knows what he is doing.  ",ct2944i,t3_3d5z2r,,3,movies,,,2015-07-13
cheshirejedi,"Actually, I felt the song was an Easter Egg in disguise.

In the Batman v Superman trailer, we see Bruce Wayne looking at a tattered Robin costume with the words, ""Hahaha jokes on you Batman"".

In the Suicide Squad trailer, we hear the song I Started a Joke which contains the lyrics ""the joke was on me...""

Now many fans have speculated that the Joker is the target of the Suicide Squad, but this little thread of connection leads me to believe the person Amanda Waller actually wants dead...is Batman.  I think the plan is for the Suicide Squad to draw out the Batman by going after the Joker and then at the last second, they'll try to kill him.

lalabhaiya,"Batman is my favourite character too. A few Batman books that I absolutely love (apart from the ones you mentioned) are -

**Batman NOEL** by Lee Bermejo (Retelling of Dicken's 'A Christmas Carol' with Bruce Wayne as Scrooge)

**Death in the Family** (whiny Robin, Jason Todd dies. But the new version which has the story 'A lonely place for dying' too. It is a beautiful intro to the new Robin)

**Dark Knight Returns** (this is one of the best Batman stories ever. Batman and Superman fight at the end)

**Batman Year One** (I good retelling of the first year of Batman where he made many mistakes)

**Batman Birth of the Deamon** (Ra's al Ghul - 3 stories)

**Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader**

The New 52 Batman run by Scott Snider is awesome too.

A few other of my favourites are -

**Sandman** by Neil Gaiman (10 books, all absolutely stunning. Specially the third and sixth)

**MAUS** by Art Speilgerman (Won Pulitzer. On holocaust)

**V for Vendetta** by Alan Moore and David Lloyd

**Watchmen** by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons

**Saga** by Brian Vaugan and Fiona 

**Bone** by Jeff Smith (10 Eisner and 11 Harvey award winner)

**Scott Pilgrim** (all 7 books)

**A Jew in Communist Prague** by V Giardino

**A Contract with God** by Will Eisner

**100 Bullets** by Brian Azzellerro

**Pyongyang, Jerusalem** by Guy Delisle

**I Killed Adolf Hitler** by Jason

Malik-Myers_,"Hey guys. I just thought I'd share with you guys my experience at San Diego Comic-Con. I got the limited edition Teen Wolf season 4 DVD with a new cover featuring Derek Hale that you can only obtain from San Diego Comic-Con 2015.  The new artwork for the Teen Wolf season 4 DVD features a shirtless Derek holding a gun. The background is red (with obligatory blood spatter), and a large triskelion looms behind him. The cover also pays homage to the scene in season 4, episode 11, “A Promise to the Dead,” where Derek and Braeden ready themselves for an attack when the alarm in Derek’s loft goes off. As we learned earlier this year, Tyler Hoechlin will not be a series regular for season 5, so it’s a nice gesture to feature his character on the front of the Comic-Con exclusive DVD case. Especially for fans who have Derek as their favorite character. I also attended the panels for Teen Wolf, Arrow, The Flash, DC's Legends of Tomorrow, and Deadpool. 

The Teen Wolf panel was one of the funniest panels I've ever been to. As you guys know the recent ratings reports had me worried that season 5 would be Teen Wolf's last season. But as one of guys pointed out Teen Wolf has a special place in MTV's heart because it's their first scripted series and still has a really strong fan base regardless of the ratings. So to be in a room with hundreds of fellow fans and hear that MTV ordered another season of the show was a truly magical moment for me. The trailer they showed for the rest of the season looked amazing and Jeff Davis gave us a minor spoiler that a rift with form between Scott and Stiles and damage their friendship in episode 5. Teen Wolf and Deadpool were by far the best panels that I went to. I'll get Deadpool but first I'd like to briefly talk about the others. 

Arrow, The Flash, and DC's Legends of Tomorrow panels were a little underwhelming. They didn't show any footage we haven't already seen and they didn't tell us anything we didn't already know. They had The Flash's new costume for season 2 on display and that was pretty cool.

*Side Note* - While I didn't get to go to the Batman V Superman panel (because it was obviously the most sold out panel at the convention) they did have the costumes on display at the convention floor so it was cool to get an up-close look at them.

Getting back to the panels I actually WAS able to attend, the best thing to come out of Arrow's panel was the reveal of Green Arrow's new suit for season 4. It looks just like the suit from the New 52 comics and while most of New 52's comics are not that good, I actually really enjoyed Green Arrow's run in the New 52 universe and that's my favorite version so it's exciting to see them pull from one my favorite version of the character. 

As for Legends of Tomorrow I'm really excited about the series and I hope it's good. But I'm a little nervous about it because I think both Arrow and The Flash have been really sloppy in the way they handle crossovers. So I'm hoping they can a natural way to have characters crossover and it not feel gimmicky or contrived.

Deadpool was my far the best panel I went to this year. We learned much more about the characters and got some insight into the making of the movie and also we got the most amazing trailer for the movie. It was so good the entire crowd (myself included) begged them to show it again and they showed it twice. It was fantastic. The humor, the action, the tone, Ryan Reynolds's performance, EVERYTHING! Ryan Reynolds was BORN to play Deadpool. I wished you guys could see it. It was great. I know many fans are upset about the Deadpool trailer not being released online and Ryan Reynolds addressed the situation on Twitter. He said they just need time to polish the special effects and that the trailer will be released in 3 weeks. That's reasonable and I'm fine with that since I got to see it twice in Hall H but not everyone is as lucky as my and I definitely sympathise with that. 

I was dressed as Captain America and got to meet and talk to all my fellow fans from around country and in cases even the world. I love Comic Con, it was a another incredible experience, and I'll never stop going tell the day I die. That's so much for letting me share my experience with you guys. You're the best.  :)

SinisterExaggerator_,"&gt;People, on the whole are, are getting wiser about their tastes and do not WILLINGLY go to ""trash"" to have their brains turned to mush.

I don't see where this is coming from at all. I know that almost any discussion of what most people or the ""average person"" wants is going to be anecdotal, so I guess I can't prove that your wrong here but from my experiences plenty of people are fine with going to see ""trash"". Just think about all the people who say that they enjoyed a movie as ""mindless entertainment"" and encourage others not to think too hard about a movie. To take a specific example you give:

&gt;They go to films that have the appearance of seriousness and solemnity (Marvel, anyone?), these films which try to act and look mature for an audience.

I think a better example of movies intended to look serious would be the Dark Knight trilogy, or the upcoming *Batman v Superman*. Marvel moviegoers, from my experiences, expect ""trash"" although they do expect exceptional ""trash"". They expect cool action scenes and funny one-liners, I think this has become especially true after *Guardians of the Galaxy*, which in my opinion is the Marvel movie that takes itself least seriously (in the last five years or so at least, I'm not familiar with ALL of Marvel's movies) and it's success surprised many people. Based on the trailers for *Ant-Man* and *Deadpool* I would say Marvel is trying to replicate the humor of GotG more than the little bits of seriousness they tried to advertise in the Avengers movies (I believe Whedon himself said *Age of Ultron* was going to be darker than first *Avengers*). So I would agree that Marvel has tried to advertise their movies as serious but I think most people saw past it, decided to watch the movies anyways as ""mindless entertainment"", and now Marvel is realizing all this and going for more ""mindless entertainment"".",ct2aay2,t3_3crx30,,2,TrueFilm,,,2015-07-13

JLVD2,"I have very little faith in the current DC cinematic universe. Judging by Man of Steel, the creators involved have a fundamental lack of understanding of who their characters are, and what makes them work. My grievances with Man of Steel are many and varied, but that is the essence of it.

Furthermore, they seem to have taken all the wrong lessons from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Instead of allowing their Cinematic Universe to evolve organically, and introducing characters and their mythologies in solo films, they're shoe-horning Wonder Woman into a Batman Superman movie and going right for a Justice League film. 

Plus, having their TV properties exist in a separate universe just seems  ... dumb.

I went to the Batman v Superman IMAX trailer, that IMAX event was supposed to be the first time anyone saw that trailer and it'd be a few days to a week before the trailer was made public.

It got leaked. I wasn't even mad, I saw the trailer in IMAX and got free tickets to see the film a week early. Then when I got home I was able to watch that trailer again an unlimited number of times. I think WB could've released a trimmed down version of the SS footage though, since that's what they did with BvS and that's deterred anyone from uploading their shaky cam version with ""exclusive"" footage.",ct25yen,t3_3d5z2r,,2,movies,,,2015-07-13

TheBigLewinski,"&gt; Hello, I am name, a web designer and marketing expert

Oh, the irony. 

It's strange how many marketers, calling themselves experts, take their drawing board sketches and just present them to the customer. Yes, you *do* need to answer the question ""why choose me,"" but not by spelling it out. 

This is dating. When you want to get someone to like you -to trust you- you don't walk up to them and nonchalantly explain that you're funny and interesting, like you're reading off some kind of menu where people should order from your personality. 

You have to *be* funny and interesting. Telling someone, outright, you possess those qualities is demonstrating the opposite.

Could you imagine watching a movie trailer and it's just the director reading off a list of positive attributes about the movie? 

""Hi, I'm Zack Snyder. You should go see Batman v Superman movie because we spent a shit load of money on CGI. I am very confident you will enjoy my movie to the fullest. In my movie you will see:

* A captivating opening scene.
* Very good writing.
* A emotional closing scene which has a very tense and thought provoking resolution. 

This will most certainly be better than most movies. Please buy a ticket. ""  

It doesn't quite work does it? 

You need a hook. Not a technical hook, a business hook. You need to *show* them you understand their position and their business, and you need to demonstrate this just enough to get some time with them. 

When you get done talking to them (in person), they should be able to say yes or no to a deal which is clear to them. 

All that said, email blasts  -which have been built by people who have opted in, mind you- have about a 1-3% conversion rate. That means 1 reply per one hundred letters, if you're sending to people who have declared they are looking for web development work. 

You have to meet people, in person. A solid portfolio only helps to build trust in a shorter amount of time. People are still hiring the person, not the skill set. They have no technical skill and therefore no way of evaluating your ability. They'll judge you in the ways they know how, by your character and their non-technical evaluation of your past work.

jvalordv,"In the direct 1v1 fight, though there was other damage to buildings and debris from the satellite, you're right. The biggest damage was the [dubstep machine of death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sge5sUNJkiY#t=1m48s), which definitely had to have had a high kill count. Earlier Zod threatened all of Earth if Superman didn't hand himself over, so few people are aware of Zod's true intention with the world engines to kill humanity and create a new Kypton. If they blame him for the destruction in the 1v1 fight, they probably will blame him for all the damage that Zod and his buddies did. Which to be fair, he wouldn't have done if Superman never came to Earth for Zod to follow him there in the first place. Wayne is probably smart enough to know Zod was a bad guy, but in the trailer he doesn't trust that even if Superman is a good guy, that he is incorruptible.

* TDKR is a model on what NOT to do for Superman.
* Heavily implies that Superman would have an easy victory against Batman if they fought. 
* Superman is at ""the top of the pyramid"" of the Justice League and after him it trickles down - including Batman. ""Can't have a Justice League without Superman.""

And I'm with ya, man. DC's going for a darker, weirder vibe when compared to the Marvel films and I'm totally digging it.

*Mad Max* used CG in a lot of shots for color correction, splicing additional cars/people into scenes, and things that couldn't have been achieved through practical effects (like the sand storm) but the attention to detail and obvious joy in making things actually happen and then filming them just elevated the whole thing. They really built those insane cars, dangled people off of them, and then blew them up. It was glorious.

xV1RALx,"If you want my opinion on how I think this version of the Joker could work, here's how I'd do it. 

Start it off with a young Joker. He's the new age crime lord in Gotham, flashy and cocky, decking himself in tattoos, fancy sports cars, nightclubs, making new drugs (his head drug chemist could eventually become the Scarecrow) all that shit. But then the Batman (young, early days Batman) starts reeking havoc on Joker's various operations, but again nobody knows what it is and the idea of a Batman is still an urban legend. Joker starts to get paranoid though as his operation is continuously torn apart by this mysterious ""creature"". 

The Joker becomes more and more paranoid, until eventually Batman comes after him personally. Batman beats the living FUCK out of the Joker, I mean really hammers him, and leaves him for Gordan and GCPD with evidence, and Joker is brought to trial. The Joker at this point is a bit shaken up by the Batman's attack, but is still a cocky new age crime lord who thinks his high payroll lawyer will get him in the clear. The trial comes, Joker's lawyer pleads insanity for him, and he is sent to Arkham Asylum. The Joker thinks he's won and is sent to Arkham and it is here the Joker we all love emerges as he realizes Arkham is far from a normal mental asylum.

The Asylum drives him mad, and at night he begins having nightmares of the Batman, he starts to go a bit crazy, focusing on the Batman constantly (carving bats on the walls of his cell???). His tattoos that were once flashy he starts to cut, burn, and destroy a bit, enough to get rid of some of the stupid flashy ones, but not too much to scar himself like say Zsasz. I'd say keep the hand smile (although fuck it up a bit) and have him carve out the teardrop J and make it a scar J possibly. 

Eventually the Joker breaks out of the Asylum, but that young cocky crime lord is no longer the same. He goes back to his men and old crime organization and they realize he's no longer who he once was. From here a Joker who is more like that of a Killing Joke/Dark Knight Returns with some New 52 thrown in there emerges. 

I think this would be a good way to go about with the Joker. Use the Suicide Squad flashbacks with the Joker as this showing of the young Batman and Joker story I talked about above, in the time Suicide Squad actually takes place have Batman make an appearance (have this be pre-Batman v Superman by a good amount of years, maybe early 30s Batman) and also have crazy post-Arkham Joker show up at this time as well to show how he changed. I think this could build for a solid universe and a different one from the classic Red Hood Joker origin. And it would also show how Batman did still in some ways help create the Joker and also show how Batman does in many ways create these super criminals/villains. Batman can also still see the Joker as his failure.

nullmiah,"This article isn't talking about how the public views Superman, but how the film industry views him.

In Man of Steel:

* The tone of the whole movie was very serious and dark for a Superman movie.
* Clark never jokes around with anyone in the movie. All his exchanges are very formal and stoic.
* Clark gets into a tiff with a customer at a bar and does the superhero-equivalent to keying the guy's car and slashing his tires. 
* Clark steals clothing from a meals-on-wheels driver
* Clark doesn't try to move the fight with Zod outside of the city. 

Batman V Superman:

* The Day of Dead people are flocking around Clark trying to touch him. What does he do? He looks off into the distance rather than converse with the people.
* The people on the flooded house are reaching out begging to be saved. What does he do? He stands there hovering above them. He doesn't interact with the crowd and show people how to get the help they need. He just sits there.

All this to me says that the Goyer/Snyder Superman is not anything that has been done before. Either they don't respect the comic book Superman or they don't understand him. This article points that out. It's not new, either. I have been a Superman fan for over 30 years. The number thing someone says when they find this out is, ""I don't like him. He's too powerful. He's too boy scout-y."" They can't conceive of anything that would make this an interesting character, so they assume no one else can, either. Maybe this is why they are choosing to make a ""dark"" Superman. One of my favorite things about the comic book Superman is that he actually has an incredibly dark past and is really destined to be one of the loneliest characters in existence but he doesn't choose to have a somber attitude about it. He chooses to be an optimist. He chooses to be nice to people.

The Superman movies had already come and gone, and now Batman had his time on the big screen; yet, they've never SHARED the big screen in 26 years.  Now that two of the biggest superheros of all time are in the same movie, and one of the best selling graphic novels of all time, ""The Dark Knight Returns"" is a basis of the film, it is likely to do huge numbers.  ""Suicide Squad"" on the other hand, does not have the name brand recognition that Batman or Superman has.  BvS will have AT LEAST double the opening weekend SS has.

jimmysilverrims,"The trailer deliberately chose a somber, serious tone—apparently following the popular trend of having a slow raspy rendition of an innocuous song vaguely relevant to the plot (although doing this to *the Bee Gees* is... an interesting choice).

This seems to imply that the film will be taking itself seriously, ar at the very least market itself seriously. This is an odd choice that's sort of dissonant with the off-beat and dysfunctional band of characters at the film's heart—especially when you're including Harley Quinn and a man named Captain Boomerang in that crowd.

This creates the very real risk of coming off as pretentious, and unlike *Batman v. Superman* I can see this as a film that a lot of people will be on the fence about seeing. Bad reviews won't put much of a dent in an event film like BvS, but something as off-beat as this could go either way. And pretentiousness is actively repulsive to the casual popcorn-flick moviegoer.

Right now, there's a lot left in the dark. I think this film will likely perform decently, but a lot can change from now 'til release.

whatudontlikefalafel,"WB is indifferent to critical reception if the film's make money. They'll continue with their cinematic universe films even if the reviews arent universally positive.

Remember that until The Avengers, no Marvel film was as well-received critically as the first Iron Man. And Iron Man 2 was the only film out of four to out-gross the first Iron Man. I remember before The Avengers, fans were losing faith in Marvel Studios, but they kept making movies and won the fans over again.

Man of Steel made good money for WB. It is a controversial film, which is why it's 56% on Rotten Tomatoes. Some people hate it, but some people also love it. This controversy is why the film has been talked about again and again and again, whereas a ""safe"" film like Thor 2 has unresolved plot threads that *nobody* is talking about anymore. WB has no doubt seen the RT score, they also saw the box office receipts, and they also see people all over the Internet arguing and debating Man of Steel creating buzz. A film like Green Lantern was almost universally panned by critics and fans, it wasn't *polarizing* like MOS, it also barely made back its budget but still didn't make enough money for them to consider making it a franchise. At the end of the day, what matters most is if these films can make money.

And if Batman v Superman doesn't make a billion dollars, I'll eat a dick.

homeboi808,"A bunch of people with powers (or just skilled criminals) get arrested and locked up. The Suicide Squad is a program where Amanda Waller, with approval from the government, is allowed to take these people and use them for suicide, black ops, off-the-books type missions, ones too dark for the heroes (such as assassinations).  
  
If they oblige, they get time off their sentences, if they fail a mission, they die, if they disobey Waller, they die.  
  
As stated in the trailer, these people came out of the woodwork when Superman revealed himself.  
  
From the looks of the trailer, we will get some background on Enchantress (as her comic book self is different than in the movie). Even Harley Quinn's backstory seems to be different from the comic books/animated series, where she fell in love with the Joker, from the trailer, she looks like she is being tortured.

AnimePoet,"Without being a superhero expert, I'm going to dare to say the following:

* C. Nolan was the best and worst thing that ever happened to DC: a fresh revival and style but hundreds of failed imitators. 

* The MCU has a marketing staff behind it that's arguably the most effective one within the film business. No matter if the hero is unknown or famous, if the film sucks or not, they somehow manage to sell it and they sell it well. Let's see what kind of marketing DC is preparing for its imminent universe.

* As OP perfectly pointed out, the main difference between DC and Marvel right now is the tone of the films. Shadows and blood VS Humour and colours, simply put. The former is a more flexible tone, you have more paths to follow and twists to make, whereas the latter is more strict and predictable, that's why the MCU is much more coherent (if you love one, you love all of them). Let's see which formula wears down first.

* I believe DC is risking everything with Superman V Batman. It's an all-or-nothing situation for them (or almost). After the lukewarm reception of MoS, DC must deliver something satisfactory and refreshing. They'll need a consensus, an approval (box office + fans + critics) to develop its own universe, so to speak.

* The hype, which has reached a never-seen-before level after the Comic-Con trailers, may benefit or completely ruin DC universe. I don't know how, but Marvel has a better control over its own hype (perhaps related to the marketing issue I've pointed out).

* Despite MCU's success, Batman and Superman remain the most famous and iconic superheroes of all time and I don't think that's going to change.

* Marvel has lately being kind of tainted by several controversies regarding the limitations it imposes over its directors. DC is clearly going to make a difference there and they're not shy to brag about it. ",ct2wry9,t3_3d6g7o,,2,movies,,,2015-07-14

wokeupabug,"&gt; I would say the point of Superman is to explore the bounds of morality in the absence of fear or compulsion... And people see this as a symbol of inspiration, as something that gives them strength to make their own choice to be good, even in the face of adversity and dire circumstances.

I suppose this makes sense.  I guess the ideal would seem narratively clearer to me if we had characters representing other choices Superman could make given his position, and perhaps have the hoi-polloi, which I guess in a certain sense represents the reader, reacting in different ways to these different characters.  You know--write a Superman/Dr. Manhattan crossover or something.  (This is the tactic I got from the *The Watchmen*, and went far in my enjoyment in it: I took each of the main characters as representing a different response to the same situation.)  But I imagine it's here that I may be simply held back by not knowing enough of the material.

That's actually what I was thinking was promising about the Batman v Superman movie--though ultimately I too have my doubts.  To have two iconic symbols of very different ideological positions opens up a lot of interesting narrative ground.",ct2i01h,t3_3cxt0o,,1,movies,,,2015-07-14

They are playing possibly the hardest game of catch up ever. If I can predict what the executives at DC are thinking is that right NOW is the time that they need to strike while the irons hot. In other words, pump as many superhero movies out now to make shit tons of money. However, they aren't taking their time. They are rushing to put all these characters on the big screen and that's not how the process usually works . Don't forget it took Marvel near 5 years to build up their universe through the original 4 Avengers (btw during the time they were doing this, I was VERY skeptical of their success).

Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Me and my best friend are polar opposites. He's into superman and I'm into Batman. This movie we can both watch and come out happy. I'm hoping at least.

Suicide Squad. A comic series my older cousin and role model got me into. I'm going with him so he can get a break from his wife and kids! Gonna need out!

Suicide Squad looks to be pretty dark and revolves around a character dynamic that has not been dealt with in cbm cinema. Batman v Superman deals heavily with the consequences of beings like Superman and tries to emulate what real life reactions might be.

hossamg1493,"I already knew that first part. But either way why is it bad that Fox is doing something different? They tried 616 FF and honestly it sucked, and in general the FF are just boring and not that great for film adaptation, hence why it would make sense they use a more updated origin story. Either way new isn't always bad, just look at DC, without Man of Steel which has it's completely own origin mind you, we wouldn't be getting this seemingly epic film that is Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice. Things wouldn't be playing out this way if WB didn't take risks in that MoS movie. So again why is it a bad thing when Fox does it with FF? Especially since they already did a mighty fine job when they did the origin of the Professor X, Magneto, and Mystique with First Class. That too didn't really follow any of the 616 content at all, yet it was a critical success. TBH most of the criticism seems to be coming from the comic book community more than the general public.

Bakkidza,"We're going to do this right, because I have time and am curious too.

1\. DC Comics.

2\. Cold open trailer narration.

3\. Oh, I see the Westboro Baptists turned their pitchforks on Superman.

4\. ""These people are rightly justified at being angry at me for killing all those innocent people"" face.

5\. I think my favorite thing is when superhero movies give us Senate hearings and courtroom drama.

6\. Is he... standing up for the hearing like he's on the People's Court?!

7\. Revisionist history bails out filmmakers.

5\. This scene of Bruce running INTO the debris cloud while everyone else runs out?! 2 sins off motherfuckers. That shit is rad.

6\. Okay goddammit. You sold me. I BUY Bruce being angry at Superman because of this. But did you have to get so heavy-handed with the proximity of the touching hug to the obvious Wayne Enterprises logo? Answer: No, no you did not.

7\. *silence* (FROM DIRECTOR ZACK SNYDER)

8\. A field! A flooded place! Papers!!

7\. This is pretty clearly the Joker, somehow escaped or something in this universe, taunting Batman. And since that looks like a regular letter with a postmark and a stamp, I'm guessing Joker knows Batman is Bruce and mailed this to Wayne Manor. Regardless... knowing Affleck is going to direct his own stand alone Batman movie, and knowing the Joker is out there in the wild in that universe... makes me EXTREMELY excited. One sin removed.

8\. But... that tower came down like that and only dozens were killed? Dozens? Was it a fucking Sunday? That's... miraculous! You should celebrate that shit.

9\. Bruce Wayne does CrossFit!

10\. I kind of love this bat-suit. I do. I don't love how much it resembles duct-tape, but other than that... awesome. But duct tape. (Yes, he does use two different conjugations for duct-tape. Check [the video](https://youtu.be/Du8BAPFR5oQ?t=75).)

11\. Whoa, Alfred is like, only ten years older than Bruce in this version. That's the youngest dam Alfred I've ever seen, though perhaps that's only because I refuse to watch Gotham. (This is a sin on Jeremy.)

10\. Holy shit, Batman in this world is fucking BRANDING fools! That's amazing! One sin removed!

11\. Really? I'd think newspaper readership would LOVE Batman stories, both pro and con. You want to sell papers, right?

12\. And I'm still fucking floored a movie universe that's trying so hard to feel real still went with the eyeglasses-only disguise for Clark Kent!

13\. Superman comes to save people, but apparently waits for them to scrawl his logo first... and then hovers dramatically for a moment as though he might not actually save them.

14\. Also, this house, this house, this house, and this house all have residents on the roof waiting for rescue. This house... it's residents are fucking dead, man. That's depressing.

15\. Cool shot, but even a farm in Kansas isn't free enough of light pollution (Jeremy says: ""these days"" here, but doesn't have it in the text.) to have this kind of view of the Milky Way.

16\. Is he just standing there because... he likes this? Or... is it taking him a really long time to realize how awkward this is? Why was he standing along by himself long enough for all these people to surround him anyway? And why are so many of them sporting the I Like Turtles kid's face paint?

17\. Is Superman literally among the spectators watching this missile launch? Cause... otherwise... how the fuck is he able to catch the top part of it?!

18\. Ah! Zuckerberg!

19\. Zod's dead, but... if you're showing him to me here... it makes me wonder...

18\. Gah! I called it! That IS a dead-Robin shrine in the Bat-cave! One sin removed for this trailer making me look like a genius after the last trailer!

19\. Why are these Superman soldiers bowing down to Superman, and why is he walking through them like he ACCEPTS their worship?!

20\. Also, Darth Superman.

21\. Now, I've always questioned the logic of the bat-signal, but am generally able to chalk it up to comic book silliness. But THIS Bat signal looks... stupid as hell. This could ONLY project a smudgy blob inside a white circle up into the sky. (Two different ways of typing bat-signal. Again, check [the video](https://youtu.be/Du8BAPFR5oQ?t=172).)

22\. Also, I can only assume he's calling Superman here, since traditionally this signal is used to call Batman himself, but this time he's the one who turned it on. My question is... how is Superman supposed to know what this means?!

23\. Also... why did you include a cape on the mechanical bat-suit? Does it still omehow [sic] help your now-two-ton-ass float on air? Cause I don't think it could. (Also, Jeremy changes his punctuation after ""Also"" between sins)

24\. Oh yeah, this movie's almost a year away still. Awesome. Um... what are you going to use to promote this movie over the next 10 months without spoiling everything?!

25\. Scuba diving, horses!! (Jeremy changes the way he punctuates this type of sin when compared to #8.)

26\. Bats flying at the camera? Been there. Bruce's parents die? Done that.

27\. Let's hope this shot of some kind of bat plane flying over an apocalypse looks less fake-as-shit in the real movie.

28\. Okay, this shot of her in a sexy dress getting into a car could LITERALLY be from one of the Fast &amp; Furious movies and I personally would never notice.

29\. Also, that dude is TOTALLY staring at her ass (No period is included here.)

30\. Whoa, Wonder Woman?! The fuck is SHE doing in this world. Isn't she a magical Amazonian goddess or something? Does that jive with a universe - oh fucking who cares?

31\. Desert Storm Batman.

32\. Oh, goodie. Kryptonite. The cause of and solution to all of the problems related to Superman on TV or film.

33\. In beating Superman's ass for destroying buildings, Batman destroys a building.

34\. Also... here's some of that famous wide-ranging Zach Snyder color palette on display here.

32\. Freezing this shot here. If you're a huge Batman comic nerd, you know why I'm also taking off two more sins.

33\. But also, if Batman doesn't get out of there in time... is Superman ready to have just murdered him? Cause he would have, right?

34\. Is that a red-coats-are-coming reference? Or... (Jeremy says ""just"" here, but doesn't have it in the text.) some obscure Superman comic reference I'm not getting. It's creepy the way he says it, but I just with I had... some idea... what the fuck it meant.

35\. Um, guys, those are gas pumps on fire right there. I'm just saying, maybe an angry bro staredown isn't the best idea in this exact location.

36\. I still think this smooshed-together logo thing is horrid.

Now for some other tallies!

* 9 uses of fuck v 4 uses of shit
* 24 uses of ellipses
* 10 uses of Batman v 13 uses of Superman
* 28 uses of exclamation points v 29 uses of question marks

Conclusion: Fuck... Superman?

homeboi808,"Crazy expensive, $250,000 to develop the master, and $60,000 for every copy. For Interstellar, it played in around 100 70mm IMAX theaters (~50 in the U.S.), that's $850,000, not including shipping, in which each copy weighs over 500lbs and is delivered on wooden pallets (in 8 individual regular sized reels which need to be combined at the theater). [I took a video of Interstellar's reel in action](http://youtu.be/lwCVArjY9cs) at MOSI in Tampa, which has a 10,5000 sq ft screen, one of the biggest in the world, the largest being almost 12,000 sq ft.  
  
Star Wars: Ep VII and Batman v Superman were both filmed in 70mm IMAX, but will only be mastered digitally, hopefully in the newest format, 3D 4K IMAX.  
  
Almost every 70mm IMAX theater in the world has/will transition to the new dual 4K IMAX laser projection. Regular 3D Digital IMAX is only 2K, so they increase in resolution is the obvious benefit, laser offers better colors and contrast (blacker blacks and brighter whites), as well as anti-aliasing.

Your comparison is from a very high level which I don't think is the correct way about it. Think about it less of being a fan of Batman in general and more about being a fan of specifically the Nolan Batman films and then seeing the current reboot stuff we're getting in Batman v Superman. They're still hitting on all of the Batman notes, parents died, gray vigilante, etc etc, but they're going about it in a different way that you may or may not like.

That's more of what I'm saying. Being a fan of very specific things from BF1 and BF2 is a detriment here because we're not getting those specific things, but being a fan of the idea behind BF1 and BF2 is fine because we're still getting that idea.",ct44uyz,t3_3dat1y,,4,Games,,,2015-07-15

arxndo,"Maybe. [Here's](http://www.newsarama.com/22461-batman-v-superman-set-in-new-mexico-sets-off-speculation.html) another shot of the desert set (which, by the way, was originally supposed to be in Morocco, but was moved to New Mexico because of fears that there would be an Ebola outbreak). The structure in the upper left corner looks like Greek ruins, making Wonder Woman's Themyscira the more likely location. 

-----
Personally, I would love it if Lex is a necon who manipulates Superman and the government to go invade Khandanq after the Zod invasion. This would be a nice parallel to how the US government invaded invaded Iraq after 9/11 even though the two were barely connected.

In particular, I'm thinking that Lex convinces the senator that Superman's presence can be used to further American interests, curb terrorism, and bring peace to the middle east. Even if Superman is not 100% on board, just the idea that Superman is American is enough to make terrorists less inclined to fight.

As it turns out, Superman is still lonely and insecure about his place in the world, which Lex knows to manipulate. Moreover, because of the Man of Steel events, Superman even feels indebted to the American people and government (This could explain why Kent's mother says ""you don't owe them anything"". She's trying to stop him from serving the military, wants him to be his own hero.)

Wonder Woman, by the way, is in the states as an ambassador for Themyscira, to participate in the debate and vote by member nations on whether to make Superman the basis of their international security. My guess is that Wonder Woman will be an outspoken critic of the plan. Bruce Wayne, who is also critical of Lex's plan, forms a friendship with Wonder Woman during this time (although, of course, Diana is skeptical of Bruce because she only sees him as a playboy).

After votes in congress and some debate UN, a military coalition is formed with Lex providing much of the necessary tech and funding. Lex even comes up with the idea that the soldiers wear the Superman logo, with the point being that it frightens America's enemies (ie. messing with the US military = messing with Superman).

EDIT: At some point it becomes clear to Lex that Diana is a threat to his plans (especially if her powers are revealed to the world in a violent fit of temper), and he convinces Superman to capture and detain her at blacksite in Themyscira (it would be interesting if Diana's own people in Themyscira betray her, too). Batman, of course, is furious and embarks on a quest to rescue Diana, who he also sees as a key to defeating Superman.

TL;DR: It's probably Themyscira, and Batman is there to rescue Wonder Woman.",ct3mad2,t3_3dabyd,,3,batman,,,2015-07-15

4 &amp; 5) Suicide Squad and Doctor Strange (could go either way between these two).

6) Deadpool

7) Gambit

It's hard to guess how successful a film will be without seeing a trailer to at least get a taste of a film. I think the top three are locked in that order, I can't see BvS not being number 1 of 2016. CA: civil war is practically an avengers film so success is guaranteed, and Xmen is coming off the back of Days of Future Past (the best Xmen film yet) so i expect Apocalypse to surpass it. 

Suicide Squad and Doctor Strange could go either way, my bet would on SS doing better because it's coming off the back of BvS and also features Batman &amp; Joker. However SS looks like it might earn an R rating, in which case it will move below Doctor Strange. 

Deadpool will also make less at the box office due to the R Rating. But given its the lowest budget film on the list it may very well have the highest profit to budget ratio. 

The release dates for all are the key here, it's why Civil War &amp; Xmen can't top BvS, they are released two weeks apart. BvS, Deadpool, Suicide Squad, Doctor Strange have no comic book movie competion at all, each getting their own month. ",ct4893g,t3_3d84zf,,2,comicbookmovies,,,2015-07-15

TBidness,"First and foremost, I'm not a huge DC comics guy...  I wasn't entirely familiar with the Suicide Squad and am trying to get educated as to what they exactly represent...

I'm a novice comic guy, as in, I have some Batman graphic novels (Dark Knight, Dark Knight Returns, Hush, The Killing Joke, The Long Halloween, Year One)...  With that said, I used to read a lot of my cousins Batman comics when I was younger, with a feint memory I can recall Bruce Wayne being hurt in London while Jason Todd was Batman beating the fuck out of people...  That's about the extent of my background...

Here is an e-mail I sent a movie buff buddy of mine with my take on the direction they're taking this whole deal (Superman v Batman, Suicide Squad, and forth)...

This is all going to be post Batman retirement, which makes perfect sense given the Dark Knight/Returns Miller angle...  

All of the villains in Suicide Squad were put there by Batman, as those are all really his nemesis's, PERHAPS, Supes puts a few people away as well, but I'm leaning more towards Arkham/Gotham as the main setting.

There is what appears to be a series of flashback sequences in Suicide Squad to before they were made...  Harley Quinn for example, when she's locked up in the start of the trailer, she's already been Harley, but they also show her getting tortured by Leto's Joker, more on that in a minute....  So, leaning towards this movie to do a series a flashbacks as they introduce the characters, Killer Croc, Deadshot, etc, with a brief background of when they made their demise at the hands of Batflec.

Why I like it...

The only angle the movies have within the DC universe is by using their actual comic story lines.

Batman particularly is the main driver here...  We already have Man of Steel, which we know was a bust but served it's purpose.

What Batman story can they tell that hasn't already been done?

With the Burton Batmans, we saw a dark enivisioning where Batman was already kicking ass...  It wasn't an origin story per say, sure, flashbacks and such but not at the level Begins was.

Then Schumacher took over and we know how that went, they were basically doing schtick with the Batman.

They know they can't even touch an origin, and the only thing that could take Batman out of retirement is seeing the destruction first hand while in Metropolis for a big meeting....   It also is the only angle where the supernatural element could truly be in play, and the only route left for DC to be relevant and compete with Marvel.  Not at a Green Latern level, at a Superman/Batman level.

Should be interesting to see how this plays out.",ct3qeb9,t3_3d68el,,1,DCcomics,,,2015-07-15
HumanTrafficCone,"Yes it will spoil the two comics I have linked above.  I am not sure if it will spoil anything in Batman V Superman, but I suspect they may take some influence from them.

If you are interested in a Batman/Supes fight/takedown I recommend reading *The Dark Knight Returns* and *JLA: Tower of Babel*. Those are the two wiki articles I have linked above.

Both have been adapted as DC Animated movies as well - The Dark Knight Returns (Parts 1 and 2) and Justice League:Doom, if you aren't the comic reading type.  Both are available on Canadian Netflix at the moment, not too sure about USA.

I don't think things need to be exactly the same as the source unless you're straight up making a movie that's whatever the story is. Like if they made an All-Star Superman movie then it should be pretty stinking close to that comic, but it's totally awesome if they say, ""Hey, we're making this Superman movie and it's this original story, but it draws on All-Star.""

Okay so if the books are to be believed. Batman has plan for EVERYTHING. He literally has contingenci plans for beating every superhero imaginable (just in case).

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueCG29Y6EyU) is pretty good ilustration how would the fight between Batman and the rest of the superheroes looked like.

Batman on several occasions beat Superman in various ways. He managed to dodge his laser eyes, or other attacks (which nobody before managed to do), etc... Basically batman is the pinacle of human. And he has all array of gadgets that can help him. Pretty much like Iron man. He has iron suite, he has various counter measures, etc...

Then suddenly this badass trailer debuts and suddenly the hype machine goes from cautious ""let's see what they can do"" to ""holy shit this is gonna rock"".

Then your first public appearance results in the death of thousands and a public that either hates or worships you, and there's a genius coming after you? 

You'd snap. You'd become the monster they expect you to be, because you weren't taught any better. There's no core of virtue in this Superman's upbringing. His parents sucked, and without them to instill into him since he was a baby the idea that his powers must be used for good, and responsibly, and that the people of the world are worth protecting, there is no reason for this Superman to actually become Superman.

My honest opinion on *Batman v Superman* is that it looks great. I loathed *Man of Steel*, but I'm glad to see that the plot of *Batman v Superman* is basically that Bruce Wayne (and everyone else) wants to stop Superman because he frankly isn't very heroic right now. The movie had many problems, but at least the sequel is addressing one of the biggest problems.

*Suicide Squad* looks like hot garbage to me. It just looks awful. I have no interest in it at all.

But, really, it is great to have a MARVEL Cinematic Universe as well as a DC Cinematic Universe that are so vastly different in tone. Sure this will cause the MARVEL v DC wars, but hopefully we can all appreciate two vastly different on screen universes and what they individually have to offer just like we have the two vastly different comic book universes that have existed for so long.

I think though what MARVEL is doing better over DC is that MARVEL's TV series are directly connected to their movies.

I was kinda over the Comic hero movie phase. Guardians and Age of Ultron were highly entertaining but paper thin. An enjoyable outing but I'd never need to rewatch. And I think I feel that way about every other Marvel studios movie except Winter Soldier.

But damn if the Batman V Superman trailer doesnt get me pumped. I really hope they paint this as an ideological opposition. Bruce came from a rich privilaged background, and didnt have the power to save his parents, and now lurks in the shadows, beating up members of the underworld. Clarke came from a modest rural background, had the power to save his dad but didnt, for the importance of his identity. I just think that meeting of two polar opposites COULD be interesting.

Then Old Man Logan. Wolverine is basically the only comic character I really care about, and we've only had a couple of movies that really only partially touch on his real motifs: was he always a weapon or was he made into one? And when you live forever, what gives your life purpose? Is it a gift or a curse?

BvS is not a JL movie, it's a segue to the Justice League. Flash hasn't been confirmed to be in it, and Ray Fisher will probably only appear as Vic Stone (instead of Cyborg), with Momoa as Aquaman most likely being a literal cameo, probably at the end.

Fofolito,"That's a tricky question. Star Wars has had a horrible problem with Power Creep. Creep happens when you start with a single instance of a character's powers, their 'feats' or abilty to do something, and then have to either create a new power or a more impressive display of the first in a sequel. Think of Dragon Ball Z: At first there were no Super Saiyans and everyone was impressed when Goku defeated Raditz. Then Vegeta shows up who is EVEN STRONGER than the guy the main characters just barely defeated so the protagonists get stronger. Vegeta is barely defeated but then Frieza shows up and He/She is EVEN STRONGER and the cycle goes on.

The Star Wars books do a decent job of keeping power levels and ability feats reasonable. As an ""average"" Jedi you would be able to force lift and force push just about any Human-sized object relatively easily. You could run faster, jump higher, work out for longer, and fly better than any normal person. You might have a unique talent that allows you to heal people or see into the future, or hide yourself from detection in the Force, or intuitively understand the mechanical workings of a machine. At this level you would consider most Jedi or Sith to be B or C grade superheros. They're more than a normal person by leaps but they aren't a Batman or a Superman or a Green Lantern and more of a Hawkeye or a Nightwing. 

The comics, which rely upon a visual spectacle, up'd the ante. Average Force Powers are cool but if you're reading a visual novel you want to see cool shit, right? Sith from the ancient Empire could pull the core out of a star causing it to go Nova and destroy a pursuing Republic fleet, and they could alchemically bioengineer terrors like the [Leviathon](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20070605190335/starwars/images/5/58/Leviathan_bg.jpg) and [Tarentek](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Terentatek). Video games took this even further where people could throw light sabers like boomerangs or in one case fight with up to five floating light sabers they controlled with their Telekinesis. This problem grew out of hand with [The Force Unleashed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkBiYpD3SDc) which began as a project before the release of the Xbox360 and PS3 to test the graphical and computational power of the upcoming game systems. Someone at Lucasarts thought the idea was brilliant and made it a game but because all products of Lucasarts at the time were considered Canon you now had the problem that there was a guy with enough Force power to pull a Star Destroyer to the ground, to send armies flying backwards with waves of Force energy, and was able to tear TIE Fighters apart with his mind.

**So to answer your question:** Yes, it is possible but it is very rare. Before the Canon reset the character of ""Starkiller"", the protagonist of that game, was said to be only a modicum less powerful than Emperor Palpatine and light years ahead of post-Mustafar (where Anakin was burnt) Darth Vader. We're dealing with A+ grade hero characters who can do this. Presumably Luke, if he were so inclined and had been trained since birth in the Force, would be able to do this as well. To most Jedi the idea of tearing a TIE Fighter apart would be laughable, let alone to say they could guide it off course with their powers. 

*Bonus Round*: You want to know who the greatest Bad Guy ever created is? Emperor Palpatine, or as his Sith homies know him, Darth Sidious. Palpatine is the culmination of 1000 years of training, tradition, deception, and planning. The Sith, defeated in open war with the Jedi time and time again, became a shadow. There would be One Master to embody power and strength, and One Student to crave it. Master to Student the ways of the Sith were passed; each subsequent generation gaining more power and more knowledge than the last. Palpatine was the last of this order and was in addition the most powerful Force User in the galaxy from birth. Born to a noble Nabooan family he was made the apprentice of the Sith Lord Plagueis who guided him in learning the mysteries of the Dark Side and in the plan to destroy the Jedi and conquer the Republic. Palpy ascended to political power through treachery, murder, deception, and manipulation and no one was the wiser. He rose from a local politician of his native Naboo, to the Galactic Senate, to Chancellor of the Republic, and finally to Emperor of the Galaxy. In him the Sith achieved what they'd never accomplished before: conquest of the galaxy and the annihilation of their hated rivals, the Jedi Order.

Palpatine's Force Power was incredible. To cloud the Jedi from seeing into his plans and deceptions he exuded an aura that permeated the entire galaxy called the Shroud of the Dark Side. This shroud clouded the Jedi's foresight, it reduced their ability to communicate with and use the Force, while at the same time increasing the abilities and morale of all those loyal to Palpatine. It was the ultimate buff. This shroud required him to maintain constant focus on casting this power however. Consider that: he cast an aura over the entire galaxy effecting every sentient being in it, every second of every day from the time he was a teenager to the time he became Emperor decades later. While sleeping, while working, while fighting, while conversing, while training he was casting this aura. He was so powerful that he transferred his essence, his soul, from clone body to clone body after his untimely demise aboard the Death Star II as a stop gap measure until he could find the key to true immortality. As a Force Ghost inhabiting cloned bodies of himself he was still strong enough to cause Force Storms to erupt in space to destroy fleets and ships. He held entire planets and solar systems under his mental dominion and drew their life force into himself to sustain himself. 

The Dude was pure, dagnasty evil. ",ct5ohai,t3_3dhgw3,,2,videos,,,2015-07-16

thehypotheticalnerd,"Its actually fairly easy. It seems daunting but you don't really have to read everything. Just the big stories. Everything else can be supplemented with looking things up on wikipedia.

I'm not the biggest expert but I can recommend some famous arcs:

* **Batman: Year One** -- If you've seen Batman Begins, that film drew heavy inspiration from this comic. I think it's a great way to introduce yourself to the comics world of Batman as it was a retelling of the origin of Batman. It's also the most famous retelling. 
* **Batman: The Long Halloween** -- Following Year One, my next Batman pick would be this story written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Tim Sale. It's a fascinating mystery that takes you through the lives of Batman, the police, and the criminal underworld of Gotham. There is a string of murders rocking Gotham starting in Halloween and continuing through every major holiday. It features numerous villains from the mafia families like Falcone to Joker to Penguin to Riddler to Catwoman all while Batman is trying to solve this mystery. It's probably my personal favorite Batman comic.
* **Batman: Dark Victory**: Immediately following TLH, this story is a retelling of Robin's origin story, the first Robin that is. Dick Grayson. Same creative team that worked on TLH worked on this and has a similar style and feel to it. It's shorter but it's a good way to continue.

And with those 3 graphic novels, you're already pretty well set on your Batman comics adventure: the birth of Batman, an intricate and well told mystery (because he's the World's Greatest Detective after all), and then the birth of the original Robin. While reading, these comics, you can also supplement yourself with reading articles on Wikipedia that further detail the history of DC. I did that in order to understand just what the hell ""Crisis On Infinite Earths"" is despite never having read it. This can help you understand how the original Robin grew older and decided to strike out on his own as Nightwing for instance. And other things too such as his time with the Teen Titans.

* **Batman: Death In the Family** -- This is one of the most pivotal moments in Batman's history. Prior to reading this, you would need to know of Jason Todd, the second Robin. He's more brash than Dick was and that is the biggest difference. Also, not very mant people liked him. This story details the end of Jason Todd's career as sidekick to Batman. 
* **Batman: The Dark Knight Returns**: This story is probably the most influential Batman story ever written as it basically established the way Batman would be portrayed moving forward -- from the 90s animated series to Nolan's films to modern comics. It is also extremely non-canon. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't read it. This would also be good to read prior to Batman V Superman comes out since the new film is lifting numerous elements from this comic. I'm not super interested in the film but thought I'd mention it.

I think it makes sense to read DKR after DinF, though it's not necessary since it was written prior to that one. Also I set this up purely if you want to read in a semi-chronological manner. If you're familiar with some of the bigger concepts like how he has multiple Robins, who they are what happens to each one, etc., then you don't have to read these all necessarily in order. I didn't. Regardless I'd suggest reading at least the first 3 to really cement your understanding of the most basic and iconic Batman lore.

* **Batman: The Killing Joke** -- This story written by Alan Moore (who also wrote Watchmen) delves deep into the psyche of the Joker and the yin yang nature of his and Batman's relationship. This story had severe repercussions for the Bat Family and is widely regarded as one of the most iconic Batman stories. Perhaps, just under DKR but above Year One.
* **Batman: Hush** -- Welcome to the modern age of Batman. Jeph Loeb returns to write another compelling and interesting mystery, this time accompanied by one of the most famous comic book artists of all time; Jim Lee. Like Long Halloween, this mystery features many villains from killer croc to Joker to Catwoman to Harley Quinn to Poison Ivy and even features a cameo from Superman. Someone is attacking Batman, striking at him in ways that are personal. Things that pretty much only Batman and his closest colleagues know. So who is the new bandaged faced villain known as Hush? Who orchestrated this calculated attack?

Other Batman stories:

* **Batman: Knightfall** -- This iconic story inspired the Dark Knight Rises -- Bane attacks and ultimately, breaks the Bat. Batman, crippled, is forced to retire and the mantle of Batman is passed on to Azrael. I've never read this myself but I know the basics of the plot.
* **Batman &amp; Son** -- Batman has a son?? This comic introduces Damian Wayne, the son of Bruce and Talia al Ghul. Damian was raised by the League of Assassins and thus rejects Batman's methodology in favor of the League's. How does Batmsn react to being a father and more importantly, being a father to someone raised by assassins?  
* **Batman: Vol 1 and 2** -- Welcome to the modern, modern Batman. The first story arc published with the new reboot of DC Comics, the New 52, is written by Scott Snyder and drawn by Greg Capullo. A string of murders pops up implicating an urban legend in Gotham -- the Court of Owls: A nursery rhyme told to little kids to frighten them and to make them behave. But Batman has looked into their possible existence before and concluded they were a myth, fabricated. So who is committing these murders in the name of the old rhyme? I highly recommend these but I'd still suggest reading the older comics first. While you could read just these it does feature characters like Nightwing, the new Robin, and more that despite the reboot, remain largely similar to how they were before.

I'd also highly recommend Gail Simone's Batgirl run from the New 52 and would also suggest the new Batgirl Vol. 1 from the New 52 that features the Batgirl of Burnside. Same Batgirl, just a new outfit, new location and new tone.

I won't go as in depth with much else but here are some other comics to look into:

* **Superman: Birthright** -- A retelling of Superman's origin for the modern era. The art is beautiful and features Clark going to a war torn country as an investigative/war time journalist. 12 issues of one of the best interpretations of the Superman origin. Alternatively, you could read Byrne's Man of Steel. It's the more iconic retelling similar to how Year One is for Batman.
* **Superman: For All Seasons**
* **The Death of Superman** -- One of the most iconic, famous, and influential storylines ever though not always for the best reasons. Many attribute the decline of comics to this but despite that, it had people standing in *lines* to buy it. Celebrities were bracelets while this happened. It was the death of permanent death in comics as we all know Superman returned after a bit and that's when people realized they could just bring back anyone even if they died. That said, it's still a fun comic. It's meaningful to me as one of the earliest comics I've ever read. It's not a masterpiece of the craft by any means. But it's just fun.
* **All Star Superman** -- Another take on the end of Superman. This story is, in many ways, the Dark Knight Returns of Superman. Though there's arguably another candidate for that. Anyway, where DKR is dark and grim and gritty, this a tory is unabashedly bright reflecting the character of Superman more. Despite that, the story deals with the heavy notion of Superman becoming terminally ill and what he can do with the time he has left.
* **Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?** -- This short story is written by Alan Moore who also wrote Watchmen. It's essentially ""the last Superman story"" and features many similarities to Watchmem, acting as a sort of proto-Watchmen.
* **Watchmen** -- One of the most influential comics of *all time*, this comic deals with an alternate universe 1980s where Nixon never left office and superheroes have been outlawed. It's a HEFTY piece of reading because each issue ends with fake newspapers or whatever with just pages of text. It's necessary to read them as well.

Anyway... I hope I helped you somewhat when it comes to Batman at least. If you want more reading lists and help go to r/comics! They have recommended reading lists for DC, Marvel, as well as other publishers with iconic stories as well as recent/ongoing series.

Comics can seem daunting, and can be pretty expensive if you buy individual issues, but boy is it a lot of fun!",ct5que0,t3_3dgiet,,2,gaming,,,2015-07-16

matthewstringer,"Interesting. Sue Kroll, Chief Marketing Officer at WB, has [shown up on reddit asking for advice on how to market Wonder Woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMarketing/comments/2gl0ih/in_light_of_recent_justice_league_news_wow_would/). She recently commented in the press on why they felt the need to release the Suicide Squad trailer early because of the Hall H bootleg copy floating around. Of course, major marketing campaigns take loads of planning and effort and that's to be admired, but with social media you've got to account for a feedback mechanism that's going to exist whether you like it or not, and you've got to account for unpredictable, constantly shifting dialog with your audience. You've got to be authentic, as the industry buzz-term implies (it used to be ""transparent"".) I mean, if you're approaching your audience soliciting their advice in one hand, then at the same time attempting to curtail opinions and commentary that doesn't reflect positively on your product in the other, does that mean you are willing to take a cue from your fans, or does that mean you are more interested in controlling the conversation? I love how carefully Batman v Superman and this new DCCU is thus far being marketed, but hopefully WB remembers that their movies are not immune to criticism and fans of these characters really do possess a certain sense of democratic ownership of the property - they'll be buying the tickets and merchandise, anyways. So, you need some kind of balance. DMCA'ing everything you don't like is going to only make you look like a bad guy.",ct5rsq1,t3_3djho5,,2,movies,,,2015-07-16

ThisisGabeB,"Feels rushed. Like they're playing keep up. Batman feels shoved. If you're planning on making a justice league movie that doesn't take place in the dark knight universe, you need to give batman a new introduction film. He's an integral character to that universe and he deserves his own film. Also, I'm still not aware if arrow and the flash shows are considered the intro to these characters, If so, that's a poor introduction, not everyone is going to watch those shows and a lot of people could wind up coming in blind in that case. 

Now all these criticisms aside, I loved man of steel and suicide squad looks fucking awesome. Even the trailer for batman v superman looked awesome.

Marvel spent years setting all the backstory for their characters up. We've built relationships with these characters. 

For dc, we have one superman film and another superman film, starring batman. 
(Unless suicide squad also acts as a batman introduction movie, which would be good and bad) 
 
So basically, right now, I think they're doing fine. But the way they are running things, I wouldn't be surprised if they have character and story issues in the future.

And overall, it's Superman's story (the primary antagonists are Lex Luthor and Doomsday, for christ's sake), so basically they're just making a sequel that's still about Supes, and tacking on everybody else including Batman.

F1F2F3F4F5F6F7F8,Unfortunately Marvel can do no harm right now. They're in and that's that. We'll just have to wait till Batman V Superman comes out. Then Suicide Squad. I think Suicide Squad will be the movie to bring more fans onto DC. I know people that aren't really DC educated but are stoked on Jared's Joker. So patience will have to come from us. We know how great the DC universe is the average film goer doesn't. ,ct75w8t,t3_3dnbkh,,2,DCcomics,,,2015-07-17
BryanDowling93,"Oh I didn't know Suicide Squad was set after Mos, I thought it might have been before. Yeah I could see Batman's involvement in Suicide Squad being a flashback to like 4-5 years before Suicide Squad/MoS, and Batman is the one who puts Harley in prison, and The Joker gets away, and maybe not long after that he kills Jason Todd, and Batman retires until Batman v Superman, which would be like 6 or 7 months after MoS, and 5 maybe 6 years after the flashback in Suicide Squad. In the solo Batman film, it'll probably be like a year after Justice League, and that'll probably be set a year or 2 after BvS, so it'd be around 7-8 maybe 9 years since Jason Todd's death, and then the Red Hood storyline happens.

Enhasiac,"&gt;Batman has all his tools and knowledge along with goku's strength and abilities.

so... goku in a batsuit then? superman has already won the goku v supermen thing 100 times before, I doubt many of batman's tools are very useful against superman (though some might, knowing how crazy batman stuff can get) still shouldn't be enough to turn the tables completely however/

also super sayain is a multiplicative, so if batman when to the same level of super sayain as goku, he would still be weaker than goku because goku's base strength is higher than batman's.

woneymell,"One of the best Batman v Superman arguments that favors  Bats comes from the famous quote ""Deep down Clark is essentially a good person. And deep down I am not."" 
If superman is in his right mind there's no way he would kill Batman and that's basically the only thing that would stop Bats from coming after Superman. Though there have been times where Supes is poisoned (Hush, Endgame) and out of his mind and Batman finds a way to stall him long enough to subdue him.

Since we are talking about Shenmue I wanted to talk about Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad: I agree with Adam on everything, the premises of the movies are great! The hype for this movie is real, and it will give to Man of Steel a lot more weight (MoS is one of the most underrated superhero movie ever).
So Adam, if I can ask, what was your reaction when the g*****n Batman, Ben Affleck, answered to your tweet?

TheVoski,"This isn't the ""real world"", this is ""DC universe."" Whereas, there is magic, ungodly technology, etc.

1.) Kryptonite - Okay, lets get this one out of the way quick. Hell, I could beat up Superman if I had some krytonite.

2.) Gadgets - None, of the movie adaptations have really emphasized just how many gadgets Batman has at his disposal. They give you the mainstay like exsplosives, grapple, and Bat Sonar but they fail to use their imagination like the writers of comics do. Batman usally carries along with his regular gear, specialized gadgets for his more deadlier enemies. Solvents for Clayface, Kryptonite ring for Superman, Antidotes and innoculations to various gases etc. Lets not forget the robotic suits and exo suits that batman has at his disposal. Here is a good example of how Batman defeats 3 superpowerd villans with specialized gadgets (https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=100&amp;v=n0npdZT2yWM)

3.) Containment - Batman is a master strategist. if we wanted, he could lure Superman to a container or room that emits red light, maybe a little kryptonite or as the current Superman movie shows, he could take away the oxygen in the room. From there, Batman could just launch it on a long journey in space, or black hole. Batman could even use Kryptonian tech against Superman and banish him to the Phantom Zone.

4.) Magic - Contrary to popular belief, Superman is not weak against magic he is just vulrenable. With Wonder Women to make a appearance in the upcoming Batman Vs Superman movie, magic may very well come in to play. There are very powerful magicians in the DC Universe with all sorts of unthinkable powers. Batman with the aid of the many magicians he knows, could learn some spells or have one of his allies cast some to aid him or hinder Superman. There are magicians that could just simply turn Superman in to a puddle of water.

5.) Advanced Technology - Here we are talking about the higly, super secret, higly deadly tech that exists in the DC Universe. Batman could utilize The Atoms tech and simply enter Supermans body on a cellualr level and finish him off. Lasers that emit Krptonite Radiation. Superman has freeze breath, here is a thermal suit that instanly works at the slightest temp change. There is even technology that could put Superman in a virtual reality like state. This and more all exist in the DC Universe and is more than accesible to Bruce Wayne. Oh and as far as eye lasers go....It doesent matter when you have a projectile deflector as the video. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWRvIrQR7Tg)

6.) Bruce Wayne Is A Good Guy Lex Luthor - This is a cheat. It wouldnt be Batman beating Superman but Bruce Wayne. Lex Luthor is the villan version of Bruce Wayne. Another character that sadly, is never portrayed as well as the comics and animated series. A team up between Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne would create a force that would be able to stand against the Man of Steel and quite possibly defeat him. Their money and power could influence politics, lead to new technologies, and even engineer public opinion about the Man of Steel. It would make the illuminati seem like the boy scouts.

7.) Hired Guns - Although many people dont believe Batman could stand against Superman, you cant deny that his Rogues gallery can. Bruce Wayne has enormous wealth. If Batman were to hire a Superman Villan like say Parasite or Krytonite Man, under his strategy and planning could very well finally take down the Man of Steel. They always come close but improper planning or stupid mistakes cause them to fail. With Batman guiding Supermans deadliest foes he could very well lead them to victory.

8.) Allies - Perhaps Batmans greatest asset are his allies. These are not just some random second rate heroes either. They are all highly trained deadly individuals. With a well planned attack using the entire Bat Family all armed with weaponry specially designed to fight Superman, they could very easily take down the Man of Steel. It would be like a RPG boss fight with several characters attacking simultaneously ticking of damage until the boss falls.

9.) Learning his secret identity - When Batman and Superman first met in the Animated Series days, Superman used his X-Ray vision to look under Batman's mask and find out that he was, in fact, Bruce Wayne. When Superman got home that night, he felt pretty good about himself ... until he discovered a bat-homing device on his cape. To his horror, Superman turned around and saw Batman standing on a distant rooftop looking right into Clark's apartment. Batman not only learned Superman's secret identity, but he proved he was way smarter.

10.) Batman has already beaten Superman - Is there any other reason better than, because they’ve already fought? Maybe not in the ‘standard canon’ if you want to nitpick about the context, but in Mark Millar’s highly acclaimed The Dark Knight Returns originally published in the 80’s, with a 2-part animated feature in 2012, Batman defeats Kal-El. The two are driven to fists as Batman becomes the head of the mutant gang after defeating their leader. The city rejects him, leaving now shamed political lapdog Superman to deal with him. He suffers a fairly crushing defeat. How? With the use of a hardened combat battle suit, and a weakening dose of Kryptonite gas Batman had Superman on the ropes. In many ways this ties together many of the other reasons on the list, preparation, technology, the existence of Kryptonite. Admittedly this happens in a rather ‘altered’ universe and isn’t to be taken strictly as history.

BryanDowling93,"I think the solo Batman in perhaps 2018 might be the Red Hood storyline. Batman v Superman will tell us that Jason Todd/Robin is ""dead"", and that The Joker ""killed"" him. Dick is possibly Nightwing, and is flying solo due to a fallout with Bruce over Jason's death, or maybe it's something else. Barbara Gordon is Oracle due to being shot and paralyzed by The Joker. She's still in contact with Bruce, but not as much, as Bruce constantly blames himself for Jason Todd's death, and refuses Barbara's help. Commissioner Gordon is also probably dead, and was killed by The Joker. The Suicide Squad could be set a while before Jason Todd's death, and the ending of Suicide Squad could somehow tie into Joker killing Jason Todd, which we could be shown in flashbacks in the Batman film, and the Red Hood figure comes into town, and well it'll play somewhat similar yet a bit different in aspects to the Red Hood comic, as it's an adaptation and it obviously won't be the exact same. That's how I'd do it, and I think DC might do it as well. ",ct6pa2x,t3_3dmjok,,1,batman,,,2015-07-17
