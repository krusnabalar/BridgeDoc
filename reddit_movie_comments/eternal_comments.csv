Skip to modern time Eternals have all been wiped of their memories so they live as normal humans except for one of them who is on a mission to “wake up” the others

*In a movie that would be full of visual effects and greenscreen — as all Marvel movies are — Feige says Zhao “was really fighting for practical locations” in accordance with her vision for it. At one point, they cut a sample reel of “Eternals” for Disney higher-ups to watch.*

*“And I had to keep saying, ‘This is right out of a camera; there’s no VFX work to this at all!’” Feige says. “Because it was a beautiful sunset, with perfect waves and mist coming up from the shore on this giant cliffside — really impressive stuff.” Later, watching “Nomadland,” he saw similar shots. “Oh! That is not just what she wanted to bring to Marvel,” he remembers thinking. “This is a signature style.”*

The ""angle"" is that Feige was explaining to other Disney suits that the shots Zhao put together for the concept reel for Eternals did not involve any CGI. He was impressed by her creative vision, but that's not the same as ""OMG no green screens??""

But that's not funny and doesn't feed into the anti-superhero movies/Marvel/Disney/mass pop culture/whatever-you-want-to-call-it narrative, so. Is what is is.",gz9sq1v,t3_njxf5d,/r/movies/comments/njxf5d/marvel_studios_eternals_official_teaser/gz9sq1v/,108,movies,False,0,2021-05-24

formesse,"The question is not ""can we interfere"" it's ""should we interfere"". And clearly - intervening is not out of their ball park. 

* preventing mass death (ex preventing severe drought)
* prevent mass scale abuse that would unfold into greater conflict
* intervene in the even of a catastrophe - seems very much in their ball park.

The only discord that seems relevant to unfold would be the type of intervention, and how direct they should be - not if they should intervene at all. Of course, the more direct the intervention - the less able to just slip back into the shadows they are and that in and itself, becomes a potential point of contention where some may prefer to be largely unknown, and others - may be tired of lurking and want to follow in the steps of that weird avengers group that has action figures, and followers and such.

It's very possible that the Ancient One knew about the Eternals, and may have even sought council with them. Remember that - the Ancient one themselves has the power to intervene in many situations and also did not - likely, following in the same sort of view point.

To intervene is to force your world view upon another - and while some groups (in particular fundamentalist religious groups) find this acceptable, many do not. So with all that they know, and all that they are capable of - should they intervene is an interesting question?

With the snap - I don't think the question is so much ""should we intervene or not"" but is instead shifted to ""how should we intervene?"". Of course with a large enough group - you will always get a few that will say ""we shouldn't at all"", but I would doubt that to be the majority perspective - if anything, a super minority with everything that has unfolded.",gzaqjwz,t3_njxf5d,/r/movies/comments/njxf5d/marvel_studios_eternals_official_teaser/gzaqjwz/,89,movies,False,0,2021-05-24

metros96,"The IW and Endgame answer is pretty straightforward. Thanos was on earth in IW for just a few minutes and Endgame for like 30 minutes, and both were kind of unexpected. The Eternals are not omniscient and are scattered around the globe living their lives and they’d likely not even hear about it in time, let alone round up the team to get to the fight in time.

Plus a takeaway from Avengers 1 is that earth clearly has heroes capable of dealing with these kinds of threats. Carol Danvers echoes something similar in Endgame. 

As for more historical examples of non-interference, we’ll just have to wait and see the explanation in the film for why the Eternals are here and what their purpose is, and perhaps the intra-group conflict over involving themselves in human affairs",gzer6ms,t3_nkpq20,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nkpq20/why_didnt_the_eternals_stop_event_x/gzer6ms/,109,marvelstudios,False,0,2021-05-25

The Avengers know because Gamora tells the GotG/Thor, or because Banner tells Tony/Dr Strange and it kind of spreads from there.  Most people on Earth wouldn't have realized there was a massive, intergalactic threat until Thanos's army attacks Wakanda, and it's probably less than an hour between the beginning of the attack and Thanos snapping.

BEEF_WIENERS,"Just because they don't interfere doesn't mean that they won't defend the planet from external threats.  Also, basically the only reason that the Avengers and Guardians got involved in Infinity War was because they were in the exact right place at the exact right time.  The Guardians happened upon Thor, Hulk was sent to warn Strange who pulled in Stark, and Cap was keeping an eye on Wanda who was shacking up with Vision.  Essentially, you were either *in the room* when Thanos' forces attacked a stone-holder or you were directly pulled in by somebody who was.

So, who knew the Eternals?  They're all clearly keeping a low profile, so nobody's going to pull them in on this.

Also, not interfering doesn't mean not defending, and a clandestine defense usually relies on being informed about what's coming - a blitzkrieg attack specifically exploits this by being too sudden for good intel to develop and be analyzed.  So yeah, I don't have a problem with the internal consistency here.",gzerwvu,t3_nkl8tz,/r/marvelmemes/comments/nkl8tz/even_when_thanos_cleaned_half_the_world/gzerwvu/,35,marvelmemes,False,0,2021-05-25

It would be interesting if the Eternals at first love to guide and help human but along the way, they lost interest or lose confidence in human and secluded themselves. Until the present day they would learn that one of the most devastating event in history of the world - Thanos -  is supposedly one of them.

Icy-Engineering1583,"It was already basically explained in the trailer and by a few lines from Captain Marvel at the beginning of End Game:

Earth is but one planet in one solar system in one tiny corner of one galaxy in the whole universe and there are many other civilizations, galaxies, solar systems and planets to watch over.

Also, I guess the Eternals interfere as little as possible and if we're being honest, most of Earth's problems in the MCU were pretty minor. 

The Battle of New York was minuscule, an almost nothing sandwich.

Sokovia was a single pepper corn on the nothing sandwich that was the Battle of New York.

Dormammu and all of the Dr. Strange stuff was a different kind of battle that operated outside the boundaries of space and time in the universal sense. It was literal magic in magical places.

The Thanos Snap may have skipped them if they're the most powerful things in the universe or they were snapped out of existence during all of that or they were elsewhere dealing with tons of other shit during the Thanos stuff, which primarily effected Earth- again, a tiny planet in a tiny solar system in a tiny corner of a tiny galaxy when you think of things on a universal scale.",gzdbul2,t3_nkja9s,/r/Marvel/comments/nkja9s/cant_see_the_logic_behind_this/gzdbul2/,18,Marvel,False,0,2021-05-25

Also, I really don't get the Marauder hate from a bunch of people - The Marauder is so badass! Especially the first encounter with the cut scene, his voice acting is perfect. I feel like most people that hate the Marauder also refused to learn the correct way to fight him.

Loganp812,"I agree 100%

Okay, then why hasn’t Superman stopped nearly every villain in the DC universe? Why didn’t the Avengers help out in the Netflix shows? Or why didn’t the other Avengers help out during the Phase 2 movies?

I hate it when people do that. For one, you have to keep certain characters out for the sake of storytelling. Secondly, realistically, only certain characters would be able to actually handle certain events at a given time. It’s not like the Eternals, or the Avengers, or Spider-Man, or whoever is on-call for every possible conflict.

PhoenixNamor,"I have a feeling we're going to see the Eternals performing ""soft"" interventions at key MCU events.

The greatest example that this may be the case is with The Ancient One and the sorcerers of the New York sanctum protecting at least part of New York vs. the Chitauri. They didn't make themselves known, but they did take part.

As more characters and teams are introduced, we may see how they fit into the greater tapestry and how/why they did/did not act at certain times.

I personally think the Eternals could not risk exposure due to the potential of attracting even greater threats (as always seems the case).  We see that the Eternals have guided mankind throughout its history, so it may be that they have weaved in and out of society, much like Diana did in Wonder Woman.

Maybe Agamotto was actually taught sorcery by the Eternals and they entrusted the Time Stone to him.

PersonalDemand3793,"To be fair, none of this is a problem as lomg as a good character or story arc comes from these absenses

Like Ant-man was a superhero in the 1960s. Where was he for the rest of history? Well, his wife “died” superheroing so he retired. What are the repercussions of his absense to him? His company and his tech were ceased for evil.

Isaiah Bradley was a super soldier in the Korean war. What happened? He got arrested and tested on because of racist policies. What are the repercussions of his absense to him? His wife died and he lost faith in America.

Captain Marvel was THE STRONGEST superhero in the 1990s. What happened? She’s fighting a thousand year intergalactic race war for 30 years in space. What are the repercussions of her absense to her? Her friend died and her surrogate daughter kind of hates her for it.

Tazran16,"I guess if youre talking about just the movies, they dont go too hard on those issues since some of them deserve more long-form exploration.

Hence, why Im glad the Disney+ shows are 100% canon; because WandaVision explored an entire couple and the cost of grief, while FATWS helped to explore a bit more bloody violance and some political threads related to the Captain America moniker, black inequality and other stuff.

The ""deeper conflict between couples"" and ""faith"" aspect that u mentioned seemed to be a thing in Eternals. Wakanda Forever will probably deal with loss. Love and Thunder seems to deal with faith in gods, as well as worthiness of being a King or holding power. MOM seems to deal with responsibility. NWH seems to deal with making a choice between being Spider-Man or being Peter Parker. Moon Knight will explore bipolar personality disorder. Hawkeye may deal with retirement and another passing-down-the-torch to fresh blood. Ms Marvel is probably about icons and the reality of idolizing icons. She-Hulk is probably about differentiating superhero life and actual work life. Loki is probably about choosing between redeeming yourself or becoming your ultimate bad self.

Basertviking,"It's sad that the MCU never really gave Thanos any of his comics powers, and relied on him using the Infinity Stones. His title as the strongest being in the universe isn't really justified anymore(I mean I guess it never really was with Celestials and potentially Galactus out there).

Eternals are born with the potential for many different types of powers through their innate ability to harness cosmic energy, but they have to train for decades to become really good at just one. This is why the Eternals in this movie tend to specialize in certain powers. Ikaris is really good at flight, energy blasts, and super strength, Makkari is really good at super speed, Druig is really good at mind control, and Sersi is really good at transmutation etc. Most Eternals are decent at flying, but some are terrible such as Makkari.

The thing with Thanos, is that he was born with more potential for cosmic energy than all other Eternals, plus he was a natural super genius. Thanos is a master of many Eternal powers, such as cosmic energy blasts, telepathy, and super strength. He also beyond that has augmented himself and his suit with hyper advanced technologies, such as some of the most advanced force field and teleportation tech in the universe.

It's a shame that the MCU turned Thanos into such a generic fighter honestly. His tech is also lackluster.",gzibw5y,t3_nl8uo3,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nl8uo3/so_these_two_are_suppose_to_be_cousins_huh_id/gzibw5y/,16,marvelstudios,False,0,2021-05-26

fehstivities,"**Gameplay after Transcendence:** Six was already very solid at FLB. One of his weaknesses before was that he needed some ramp up time to reach higher stacks of Heavenly Howl and start hitting as hard as he possibly can. His level 130 upgrade gives him access to an EMP skill that gives him up to 3 Heavenly Howl stacks at the beginning of a fight. This gives him access to that sweet perpetuity atk mod and dmg cap buff right away. Additionally, if he's at 6 Heavenly Howl stacks when pressing his second skill, he'll gain double strike for a turn. These improvements don't feel huge, but it's hard to improve on perfection lol.

Personally for 140 and 150 I want to see them give him an anytime assassin, with his third skill inflicting a mark debuff (like Zeta) and his first skill giving him the mark assassin. I don't think it'll actually happen, but it would be pretty funny if it did. Let's just let him do even more damage.

**Character:** He's definitely my top GBF character of all time. He's a guy who tries to make everyone think that he's a dark and mysterious loner, but in reality he really wants friends. I love the slow growth of his character from when you first meet him to who he is now. You get to see him go from being a loner who isolates himself for his own reasons (bc he feels guilty about how he killed almost everyone in his clan) to a guy who obviously really cares about his friends. 

I think No Rain No Rainbow and Seeds of Redemption are actually really good for indicating this change, outside of his fate episodes. In No Rain No Rainbow, he gets invited by Danchou, Lyria, and Vyrn to go and visit Raduga, which Ladiva opened on the Grandcypher. He acts all tough and is like ""hmph i dont wanna go :/"" but finds himself at Raduga's entrance anyways. And then when Phoebe kinda pushes him into going inside with her, he basically has to stay because he doesn't want to hurt her by pushing her aside or anything. Later on, he sees that Jamil and Phoebe are going to go on a trip at night to gather some herbs, so he just... joins them because he would feel bad if they got hurt and he didn't take the chance to go with them. Big brother instinct is real.

Seeds of Redemption's overall story is kinda disorganized, but for the Six-focused parts, one of the focuses is his relationship with the other Eternals and Danchou. He's willing to give up his place in the Eternals and turn himself in to the Crew of Enforcers, and he doesn't really care about how most of the Eternals feel about it (read: doesn't really care about how Siete feels) until Danchou and Funf show up to guilt trip him like ""You don't want to keep travelling with us? :("". His Event version's skill fate episode is super cute, we get to see more details on Six's meeting with ""that man"" -- aka Danchou's dad.

Only complaint is that after the first like 2 times, the mask stealing thing gets old. Six's social anxiety is played for laughs. However, it does make voluntarily taking off his mask off to talk to certain characters (basically just Danchou/Lyria/Vyrn tbh) more significant since usually he doesnt want the mask off under any circumstances. He does this a couple of times in SoR and drops the sickest lines while he's at it (""I promise I will come back. I'll crawl all the way home if I have to.""). Why is he so cool lol.",gzi96ch,t3_nlc7m5,/r/Granblue_en/comments/nlc7m5/eternals_discussion_seox_post6_stage_3_uncap/gzi96ch/,11,Granblue_en,False,0,2021-05-26

DefNotAShark,"I've just started reading the comic so I don't know all of it yet, but the basic idea so far is that the Celestials (impossibly massive and powerful space entities) created The Eternals, perfect immortal beings with superpowers, who safeguard and shepherd humanity and protect them from The Deviants, imperfect superpowered beings who aren't so much immortal but pretty persistent malcontents. Seems like the Celestials were more or less fucking around and experimenting to create things and ended up with Eternals, Deviants and humans without specific purpose or reason, but The Eternals take their role pretty seriously and have mostly done a good job over the course of humanity's existence.

One important plot point is that The Eternals don't seem to remember that they are The Eternals when the comic begins in present day. Some of them remember, some kind of remember, and some don't recall anything and think they are human. It appears their bodies are immortal but their memories are susceptible to fading because they've been around so long. If they adapt this idea into the MCU it would explain why they weren't around for all of these big MCU battles for Earth.

Some of this may be incorrect since I haven't got very far into the comic.

**Seekers** Are the graftlings that occupy the outskirts of the city and are friendly to mortal races and wish to move on to the afterlife. They see the immortality as a curse and wish to move on. They are lead by a high level Druid half elf. Ravana

Asimov's short stories are really worth looking up, although unfortunately a lot of them aren't available in ebook form. I wish there was a collection of all of them!

I'd recommend *The Gods Themselves* if you haven't read it yet. It was his last really good SF novel. Also, *Murder at the ABA* is absolutely **great**. It's a mystery that features Asimov himself as a character, as well as a parody expy of Asimov's friend Harlan Ellison as the detective. Through the book the MC and Asimov snipe at each other in footnotes. It's a riot.

Asimov loved the book and wanted to make it the first of a series, but his publisher nixed the idea.

Guardians... that was definitely a gamble, but comic fans LOVED the recent run of that book that inspired the movies. I didn't read it myself, but people wouldn't shut up about Guardians of the Galaxy for years. Morbius and Kraven don't have that sort of heat either.

FarhanIslam,"Maybe because The Eternals had their memories wiped by Sprite just like in the comics so, they resume their lives thinking they are human beings. Once they get their memories back, they decide to intervene.

Now, how can this be proven. I have a theory here. Back when photos of the filming of this movie leaked, one of the photos we saw was of Sersi (Gemma Chan) kissing Dane Whitman (Kit Harrington). The setting looked like it was set in the present days. 

Then, in the teaser trailer we saw Sersi and Ikaris have a relationship. So, what I guess is maybe back before their memories were wiped, Sersi and Ikaris were partners but as their memories were wiped and they were separated. Sersi resumed life as a human being and got into a relationship with Dane Whitman.

Superman now has flaws, good developed storylines, loses all the time, can be gritty, can be relatable, gets nerfed a lot by different writers so has room for growth in strength. He doesn't just go out to save the day and punch things until it's in his favor.

Captain Marvel is the same plus she lives a lot more normally, went through a lot to go from Ms. Marvel to earn the title of Captain Marvel over decades, and has interesting stories with cosmic heroes rather than only Earth heroes. 

Sentry is all mentally insane, is inflicted with the void, and has a whole dynamic with all that. His idea was: what if you gave Superman powers and more to a mentally ill drug addict?

The Eternals are different than superheroes and don't altogether go out and save the day. They have different inner relations with each other, and lived for such a long time that their minds work different.

swallowyourmind,"Counter theory: When Thanos snapped, and half of all life was wiped out across the universe, half of the Eternals were dusted.

They freaked out. This had never happened before, in all their freakishly long lives.

Maybe they were able to re-form the half dusted from their compound, over time. Maybe not.

When the Avengers snapped everyone back, something the Eternals may not have been able to do themselves or had considerable trouble to do so even at their advanced level, they realized Earth had come far enough that humans may be ready to accept them.

There is disagreement amongst the Eternals whether that time has finally arrived.

Then Deviant threat appears. It likely is because the Deviants had spent centuries underground amassing supplies and people to attack the Eternals which went belly-up when half got dusted. When half of the Deviants are brought back by the Avengers, the Deviants decide that they must act now, while their numbers are high enough again.

The Eternals, with hesitation, decide they must act. For the first time in a long time, they had an example to follow. The Avengers.

They need to prove their worth and save everyone, as the New Avengers aren't ready to deal with a threat this large directly after Thanos.

Jessie_Phoenix,"Q: If several abilities are triggered at the same time (at the start of a hero phase, for example), how do you determine the order in which they are used? 
A: If several abilities can be used at the same time, the player whose turn is taking place uses their abilities f irst, one after the other, in any order they desire; then the player whose turn is not taking place uses their abilities, one after another, in any order they desire. The same principle applies to any other things – such as command traits or artefacts of power – that can be used simultaneously. Note that abilities used at the start or the end of a phase still count as being used in the phase in  question. For example, the Flesh-eater Courts Savage Strike command trait allows a general to fight at the start of the combat phase, while the Stormcast Eternals Sequitor Aetheric Channelling ability is used at the start of the combat phase too. In the Flesh-eater Courts turn, the Savage Strike command trait would take effect before the Sequitor Aetheric Channelling ability.

As for an information wiki, I've actually found a really good YouTube Creator known as comics explained, that really knows his stuff. I actually really love him, and he's currently doing a bunch of stuff on the eternals. You should definitely check them out! 

He has two separate channels, one that's called comicsexplained, where he does roughly 30 minute videos on comic book concepts, and now he's spun off into a geek culture explained which does the same thing but in a 10 minute format, so if you're not really in-depth with comics, you won't get lost.

WyldeBolt,"* I ended up getting Mexican food last week, and, acting on /u/MsNewKicks' suggestion, I ended up getting [chilaquiles, along with a breakfast Cali burrito and a Mexican Coke](https://i.imgur.com/2oXTcJw.jpg). I knew this particular place was going to be good because it's a basically a hole-in-the-wall; it's literally inside of a Chevron and I almost got lost looking for it. The chilaquiles were amazing, and while I didn't really need the burrito, I certainly did not regret ordering it. Definitely going to come back here a few more times for lunch, and even breakfast, especially since a family-owned place.  

* Revisiting another promise, I did end up [getting shawarma](https://i.imgur.com/oxZxqs1.jpg) yesterday. I ended up getting chicken and beef/lamb, and I ended up liking the chicken one a little bit more.

TheMiniman117,"This is a great write-up, thank you for providing a lot to think about. I am an Asian man, and thought I'd chime in on your last paragraph, though this is not at all backed by scientific or scholarly data, and is purely my own observations, but it seems to me that more and more, Asian men-leads in hollywood are fairly similar to white men-leads. I suspect that it is partly due to the Model Minority aspect of being an Asian in America, where there is a kind of bestowal of what we may call ""white-enough."" What I mean is, it seems that financial success (whether by ""merit"" or inheritance) means the minority has attained a kind of whiteness that isn't *fully* white (as whiteness is ultimately a visual thing, above all else), but, again, a kind of ""white-enough."" I am reminded here of movies like *Crazy Rich Asians* and the new Marvel *Eternals* movie with Kumail Nanjiani where the leading men are muscular and/or rich, fitting at least some aspects of the white male hegemonic ideal. 

Though a weird thing I notice in those who are fans of K-Pop is that they infantalize, for example, the BTS members and other young men in those bands; perhaps it's just to cater to teens or some similar demographic, but it is odd to me that it is such a stark and frankly opposite (malicious) ideal to that of what I think you're pointing to above. 

I don't have anything to add to what you said, I thought I'd just share my observations because you shared so much (and no one is really discussing this here in this post unfortunately).

Women account for 50% of the population, and the main cast actually hits that proportion. You have to admit that's pretty great on one hand, even if you happen to be a person who likes strict adherence to source material. (And I get that, I can be that way sometimes as well.)

Despite its pedigree, Eternals have never been a big seller for Marvel, so I think relatively few people have a strong attachment to the classic comics incarnation. So I think they felt they had a little more of an opportunity to mix things up than they did for say, Iron Man.

Hell, even in the comics, Makkari has gone from a white guy with blonde hair to a darker-complexioned guy with black hair. Its kind of written into their very makeup that they can manipulate their molecules to disguise their appearance — especially Sersi.

That's a lot of female heroes who will be playing leading roles in the upcoming phase 4 projects. I call that good progress. As for Spidey, we all know the joint custody situation is complicated, introducing any female characters from the Spidey side would mean a joint project with Sony, and that's not a call that Marvel can make alone. It is much easier for Marvel Studios to pull from the rest of their foster of female heores, which as I have listed above, they are, and they are coming soon in phase 4.",gzuyjns,t3_nnk9wk,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nnk9wk/does_anyone_feel_the_spiderman_movies_are_kinda/gzuyjns/,3,marvelstudios,False,0,2021-05-29

No one would’ve even suspected Ikaris sticking to the Eternals missions and going against the hroup thinking he’s right and noble had it not been for those leaks and yet Ikaris/Richard were said to be a stand out to Marvel and audience during OVERWHELMINGLY positive test screenings. So this is why I’m saying its better to wait for context than to immediately dismiss something because its not like the “comics” which most MCU characters are pretty much different from their counterparts.

Sometimes it works (like most of the MCU has) and sometimes it doesn’t. We won’t know that for Eternals until we actually see Eternals.

The_Messenger_12,"1. You're not on Marvel's payroll you don't gotta defend them. Fiege isn't nodding his head in approval at you for defending their business on reddit. 
2. People probably want Deadpool 3 to be R rated because the last two movies were, and people liked those. Go figure fans would want consistency 🥴.
3. Blade with an R rating makes sense because he's a half vampire dealing with vampires. A pg-13 movie about vampires with no blood sounds lame as fuck. I'm not too familiar with Moon Knight but I imagine his fans want an R rating for a reason.
4. All Marvel movies are the same flavor only slightky different each time. Yet another reason people want certain characters to be R rated. Eternals is not ""branching out"" lmao it's still a Marvel movie.

Your aversion to an R rating makes no sense that's why people are calling you out on it. I don't see marvel fans begging for an R rated Spider-Man or Captain Marvel or whatever. They want it for the characters that make sense. I don't think we would've gotten a Wolverine movie as good as Logan if not for the R rating, and none of the marvel movies come anywhere close to that level of quality. If Deadpool 3 was pg-13 then it loses a lot of it's creative freedom from the first two movies.

Each project has its own spin on the property, but at the end of the day, they all have to be assimilated into the larger MCU. 

*WandaVision* was very different, same with *Falcon and the Winter Soldier,* and *Loki* looks to be different too. *Eternals, Multiverse of Madness, No Way Home,* etc. will also probably be big leaps for Marvel, whether stylistically or in terms of the story.

Autoganz,"I would suggest looking a little further into their storylines then, which give a lot of weight to the theories other fans are coming up with.

One story explained that their “hands off” approach was because their main mission was to observe. They were chosen/created by the Celestials with a singular purpose, and being somewhat alien from mankind. Aside from their early influence on humans, the Eternals really only intervened when it came to certain types of events. It was a convenient way for Jack Kirby to explain that they’ve always been around, but due to plot mechanisms they haven’t been shown.

Another storyline showed that they actually HAD been involved, but there was a type of mind-wipe that happened. Eternals don’t really die, instead they come back in a re-generated body. During that process, they have to learn who they were because they don’t automatically know. In the Neil Gaiman story, the majority don’t even know they’re Eternals until an event leads them to remember.

There are a lot of ways they can take this.",gzwcsgb,t3_nnnyrs,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nnnyrs/discussion_why_didnt_eternals_appear_in_mcu_so_far/gzwcsgb/,2,marvelstudios,False,0,2021-05-29

BighurtRN,"Because a very small segment of the movie-going audience has heard of The Eternals. When the MCU was created, they were making movies out of characters that people had heard of but weren’t hugely popular or relevant at the time. The Avengers were widely considered a B-Squad compared to X-Men characters in the Marvel universe. Each individual MCU movie slowly built the foundation of trust the audience now has with Marvel Studios. Guardians of the Galaxy is arguably the most critical entry in the MCU in regards to the Eternals. Guardians comics were nearly unheard of by mainstream audiences and the fact that Marvel Studios created something successful that felt unique but still fit into the MCU showed that enough of a report had been built between fans and the studio that the MCU can introduce something almost unheard of. Because many of our beloved heroes have moved on, we are ready for something fresh and the MCU brass knows we are open to new things. The Eternals can fit the narrative nicely. Also, now that Disney owns the X-men characters, they can now incorporate mutants into the MCU and the backstory of the Eternals may play a critical role in that introduction.",gzvfzun,t3_nnnyrs,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nnnyrs/discussion_why_didnt_eternals_appear_in_mcu_so_far/gzvfzun/,2,marvelstudios,False,0,2021-05-29

DoctorJay26,"Are we counting the characters that are to be released in the next phase? Like the Eternals, the Fantastic 4, She-Hulk or Blade?

If they are included, I'd say this is an easy win for the good guys, taking into consideration we have the Eternals and the Fantastic 4 in the team, they would add a lot to the fight. 

If we are not including them, I'd still say the good guys win. Thanos has no gauntlet but still he's tough AF, Mysterio's powers aren't really a mysterio anymore, and I'd say most of these villains can be dealt with no problem. Some of the older villains that died on the image, died when the heroes weren't at the high power level they were when we last saw them in Endgame. So, some zombies would be harder to kill than some others. Quicksilver is one their biggest player in my opinion.

However, on the good side we have a handfull of noobs, like Spiderman, and taking on the task would seem too much for them. We don't have that many metahumans, and many rely on suits, weapons and tech, so that is a weakness. They still have Thor on their side, which is a mayor game changer. But they don't have Captain America cos he's old, so yeah that sucks.

Huh? Death of the author means we can definitely ignore what he wrote outside of the text.  

Just because an author didn't intend something or explicitly denies something elsewhere doesn't mean the text itself can't have certain unintended themes or idea. Take Jack Kirby's The Eternals. It involves a struggle between two ancient races. The Eternals, all drawn in beautiful Aryan glory, and the deviants, who are evil because of bad DNA. It's kinda weird and gross. 

Jack Kirby also created Wakanda, Captain America, and *literally killed Nazis.* His themes just kind of got away from him in the Eternals.",gzxq0pe,t3_nnlbjt,/r/badhistory/comments/nnlbjt/bitesized_badhistory_tolkien_and_racism/gzxq0pe/,13,badhistory,False,0,2021-05-30

Theinternationalist,"That's an interesting question; it almost certainly would not have been the highest grossing move of 2020 if that was true (*by this point both Black Widow and the Eternals would be out by now, and that's just Marvel*). More importantly, it would have had to compete with a bunch of other releases that prevented fellow Shonen Battle Canon Anime Movies like *Dragon Ball Super: Broly* from clearing so many hurdles.

I wouldn't say ""impossible,"" but there's a good chance that a favorable ""light COVID"" environment mixed with a dearth of worthy competitors gave it the chance to be the highest grossing anime movie yet, the highest grossing *Japanese* film, highest grossing foreign language debut in the United States (*Quebec probably complicates the Domestic market*), and likely a bunch of others I missed.

Then again, maybe even **with** the competition an R-rated shonen battle movie that requires lore to properly comprehend might still have cleaned up. And either way, even with the COVID presumption the path is open now.

Jattack33,"The full Athanasian Creed

&gt;Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith. Which faith unless every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. And the catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Essence. For there is one Person of the Father; another of the Son; and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one; the Glory equal, the Majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is; such is the Son; and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreated; the Son uncreated; and the Holy Ghost uncreated. The Father unlimited; the Son unlimited; and the Holy Ghost unlimited. The Father eternal; the Son eternal; and the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet they are not three eternals; but one eternal. As also there are not three uncreated; nor three infinites, but one uncreated; and one infinite. So likewise the Father is Almighty; the Son Almighty; and the Holy Ghost Almighty. And yet they are not three Almighties; but one Almighty. So the Father is God; the Son is God; and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not three Gods; but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord; the Son Lord; and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not three Lords; but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity; to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord; So are we forbidden by the catholic religion; to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords. The Father is made of none; neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created; but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten; but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is before, or after another; none is greater, or less than another. But the whole three Persons are coeternal, and coequal. So that in all things, as aforesaid; the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped. He therefore that will be saved, let him thus think of the Trinity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation; that he also believe faithfully the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess; that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man; God, of the Substance of the Father; begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the Substance of his Mother, born in the world. Perfect God; and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood. Who although he is God and Man; yet he is not two, but one Christ. One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by assumption of the Manhood into God. One altogether; not by confusion of Substance; but by unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one Christ; Who suffered for our salvation; descended into hell; rose again the third day from the dead. He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from whence he will come to judge the living and the dead. At whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies; And shall give account for their own works. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire.

FallOutFan01,"No not exactly.

She’s overpowered as as shit.

It’s just she has limitations off Asgard.

Best way to describe it, while on Asgard her durability is for all intents and purposes limitless (needing to be taken out by a full power Surtur ), her aging is retarded (biologically immortal) and she can channel limitless energy as far as we knew through Asgard which could have to do with Tessaract shenanigans in order to transmute matter to create armor, weapons and structures.

The last dudes who could do that was Ego the celestial planet and a [theoretical physicist with a degree in engineering and chemistry.] (https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Eli_Morrow)

Oh and the Eternals who in the trailer could create water through transmutation [this item in Odin’s treasure vault suggests strongly that Hela was possibly an Asgardian pseudo Eternal] (https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Tablet_of_Life_and_Time).

Off Asgard she has enough physical/raw cosmic juice to shatter Mjolnir which had been amped up with Odin’s special magic aka the Odin force.

Of Asgard Hela is way stronger than Thor, Loki and regular rank and file Asgardians.

Regular Asgardians are overpowered as shit compared to the rest of the universe minus Dark Elves, Frost Giants and the Kree.

A regular non-combat ready Asgardian by the human alias Elliot Randolph who let himself go through hedonism got stabbed through the chest and received a perforated heart, he was stabbed by an enhanced human male welding and Asgardian metal staff which gave him superhuman strength.

He was rendered unconscious and survived by the outside assistance rendered by SHIELD agents Coulson and Simmons reached into his chest and pressed his perforated pieces of heart back together and his residual healing factor healed his heart wound they than massaged his heart and he regained consciousness in a few seconds and made a full recovery in a minute all without any fancy Asgardian Uru metal armor.

&gt;”You were right. He's Asgardian.""
""Good thing. Otherwise, that would have been awfully embarrassing.""
―Grant Ward and Phil Coulson[src]

&gt;”Asgardian Physiology: As an Asgardian, Randolph has several superhuman abilities.”

&gt;""You'll have to go through me.""
""And I could. Literally.""
―Leo Fitz and Elliot Randolph[src]”

&gt;”Superhuman Strength: Like all Asgardians, Randolph is superhumanly strong. He was able to break the Berserker Staff into three pieces, bend a knife that Grant Ward used to attack him with one hand, and easily break off the handcuffs that were supposed to restrain him. Randolph also claimed to be strong enough to literally walk through Leo Fitz.”

&gt;”Superhuman Durability: Randolph's body is much more resistant to physical harm than the body of a human being. He was able to grab and bend the blade of a knife without cutting his hand. However, he was seriously injured by the Berserker Staff.
""Asgardians regenerate faster than we do.""
―Phil Coulson[src]”

&gt;”Regenerative Healing Factor: Despite his body's resistance, Randolph can be injured like any other Asgardian. However, his metabolism enables him to rapidly regenerate damaged bodily tissue with greater speed and efficiency than a human being is capable of. When he was stabbed in the heart with the Berserker Staff, he was seriously injured and would have died if Coulson had not stopped the bleeding long enough for his body to regenerate itself. Randolph was completely healed a few minutes later.”

&gt;”Longevity: Randolph ages at a rate that is much slower than that of a human being. Even though he is over 3000 years old, he still looks like a middle-aged man by Earth standards.”",gzz07a4,t3_nny09r,/r/whowouldwin/comments/nny09r/all_major_deceased_characters_of_the_mcu_return/gzz07a4/,6,whowouldwin,False,0,2021-05-30

Antyctus,"I first got into Warhammer Fantasy at the beginnings of The End Times, having been unaware of the plans to destroy the World-That-Was and relaunch the narrative into Age of Sigmar. Once the debut edition launched in 2015 I became really invested in the narrative behind the Realm of Chaos and Sigmar's attempts to repel the forces that had suceeded in destroying The Old World. I was delighted to hear that some of miniatures and characters from The End Times had managed to make their way to the Mortal Realms, and when the story began expanding upon the natures of each of the individual realms and the efforts of the Everchosen to branch out into these myriad realities I became more and more interested. What has significantly improved since the First Edition is that there is a little more structure with the battles and wars set in Age of Sigmar lore, it's no longer as loose and unsolidified as it was. I've particularly been invested in the forces involved in Ghyran, the Realm of Life, especially the Living City's involvement in the Seeds of Hope campaign and more recently the denizens of the dark kingdom of Invidia, one of the Plague God Nurgle's footholds in Ghyran and a major military conflict involving a smattering of Stormcast Eternals, Sylvaneth, Duardin, etc.

With Third Edition leading to Ghur, the Realm of Beasts, and the teasing that the forces of Order are planning on making a major military offensive directly into the Realm of Chaos, I'm excited to once again see the rules of reality bend as the Dark Gods attempt to bring about the Age of Chaos once more. I'm especially hoping that there will be some expansion into Ulgu, the Realm of Shadow, as it and its ruler Malerion remains one of the only remaining Mortal Realms to date that has not been expanded upon in the narrative.",gzzm84l,t3_nodpca,/r/AoSLore/comments/nodpca/what_got_you_into_age_of_sigmar_lore/gzzm84l/,6,AoSLore,False,0,2021-05-30

LordTenebris1,"Nothing save the Celestent Prime is likely comparable to the Custodes levels. 

But regular run of the Mill Stormcast In melee with an Astartes is a fifty fifty. The Stormcast's where designed for reasons very similar to the Marines, but are still regular people. Whereas the Astartes are elavated Humans. The Astartes are smarter and more durable, but the Stormcast is relentless and will keep coming back, getting more relentless and smarter. So, while it would be a tough damn fight on both ends, the Astartes is likely to win a lot, until the Eternal eventually wins, though at great cost to himself. 

It's also worth pointing out that Stormcast do off themselves as an actual attack as they explode lightning in a wave.

FreshwaterJosh,"There's so many unknowns, and yet it seems like everyone is quick to jump on this group for not showing up sooner.

Are the Eternals immune to the Snap? Probably not, but it doesn't matter. They may not be in close contact with each other, and we don't know by what mechanisms they can reach out to one another. Eternals probably keep a relatively low profile (Kingo aside) and move around often enough that nobody thinks it's weird that someone isn't aging. It's highly likely that they go more than 5 years without talking to one another.

The events of Infinity War take place within a day, in a variety of locations around the world, which doesn't given them a lot of time for a coordinated response. The Eternals have been on earth for tens of thousands of years, and we don't know if are even aware of Thanos or what his plans are or that he's gathered any stones. And further, like Captain Marvel points out later, the Earth has the Avengers protecting it. Should they have any reason to doubt that the Avengers won't be successful again?

After Infinity War, everyone believes that the danger has passed. The new normal is that 50% of all creatures on Earth are gone, and people are rebuilding. Five years later, they've worked out a lot of problems, which is exactly that the Eternals would expect to happen. Might even be that the Eternals stepped in and provided some technology or improved some weather so that starvation didn't run rampant right after the Snap when lots of agriculture workers would've gone missing.

The events which took place in Endgame were secret. No one widely knew that the Avengers were going to try to undo the Snap, and after Bruce brings everyone back, events pretty much play out in real time. Again, this means there isn't a lot of time to get the Eternals back together to fight Thanos et al, which not even the Avengers were expecting to have to do again.

And I suspect that choosing between intervention and non-intervention will be a big point of contention between the Eternals, and perhaps Thanos is a breaking point for many. A great many of the Eternals seem to have a great affinity for people, and have been helping humanity out behind the scenes. Even Druig, who is being positioned as something of an adversary within the group, may feel that more direct intervention is required.",gzy1jzr,t3_no1jg0,/r/marvelstudios/comments/no1jg0/the_eternals_and_the_snap/gzy1jzr/,5,marvelstudios,False,0,2021-05-30

fiona_codia,"My comic book knowledge on the ""Marvels"" are limited since I mostly focus on the X-Men but here's what I know:   
  
So you have Mar-Vell, the original Captain Marvel.   
  
Carol Danvers, on the other hand, got into some sort of accident that involved the Psyche-Magnetron, which resulted to her having a split personality: one was Carol Danvers and the other was Ms. Marvel, who had the powers of Carol’s friend and sorta crush, Mar-Vell. The split personality was sorted out later. Basically, she’s like the Falcon to Mar-Vell’s Captain America, if you get what I mean.  
  
And then Mar-Vell died and Monica Rambeau became the new Captain Marvel. Monica, however, does not have any connection to the previous Captain Marvel, which I think she acknowledged later on.  
  
When Monica bceame Photon, the Captain Marvel moniker went to Mar-Vell’s artificially generated son, Genis-Vell, and then after that, to his artificially generated daughter, Phylla-Vell.  
  
There was also a second Ms. Marvel, who I don’t know much about aside from that she got her powers from the Power Broker and she appeared in the Fantastic Four comics. I think her name was Shiela or Sharon.  
  
There’s also been several Marvel Boys, in which one of them got their powers from the Eternals and another who became Quasar. The Marvel Boy I know best is Noh-Varr, who came from a different universe. After Secret Invasion and during the Dark Reign, Norman Osborn was forming his roster of Avengers (known to readers as Dark Avengers) with villains standing in as the heroes. Osborn took Noh-Varr and made him the Captain Marvel of the team.  
  
Norman also tried to get Carol on his team but she refused. So he went to Karla Sofen, a Ms. Marvel villain who goes by the name of Moonstone, and made her the Ms. Marvel of the Dark Avengers.  
  
I don’t want to spoil you about the events of Dark eign and Seige so all I gotta say is that by around 2012-2013, Carol finally became Captain Marvel and Noh-Varr later became a member of the Young Avengers  
  
The next Ms. Marvel is Kamala Khan, an Inhuman who’s a big fan of Carol Danvers. Hence, her taking the moniker Ms. Marvel. She and Carol eventually met and would sometimes team up, until the issues in Civil War II came up and Kamala later formed the Champions.  
  
There’s also Adam Brashear, aka Blue Marvel, who was created around the late 2000’s. His closest connection to the “Marvels” is Monica, whom he had a relationship with.  
  
And then there’s the really weird case with Jean Grey, who originally went with Marvel Girl. The moniker was used in the first few issues of X-Men and X-Factor, but it was pretty short-lived. In latere issues of X-Men, she dropped the name, became Phoenix and died. Then she came back to life and  started using Marvel Girl again when she joined the X-Factor but the name was dropped once again and she started using her real name. From then on she either went by “Phoenix” or her real name. The recent uses of Marvel Girl were in Bendis and Hickman’s run of the X-Men. Bendis’ run had the OG5 teen X-Men go the future so they ended up using their original codenames, including Jean. Hickman’s run is the most recent one and is still on-going. Here Jean went back to using the Marvel Girl moniker, for kind of unspecified reasons. The nearest connection she has is that her father-in-law is the leader of the Starjammer, a team in which Carol Danvers was once a part of.  
  
I think that the MCU is focusing on Carol Danvers and her relation with Monica and Kamala, the former existing only in the MCU and the latter which was in the comics and was a big part of Kamala’s start as a superhero.  
  
**TL;DR: The first Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel were friends, the second Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel kinda unrelated, the third and fourth Captain Marvels were artificially created offsprings of the first Captain Marvel, the several Marvel Boys were kinda unrelated as well, the fifth Captain Marvel was one of the Marvel Boys and third Ms Marvel was an enemy of the first Ms. Marvel (both were part of the Dark Avengers), the fifth Captain Marvel was the first Ms. Marvel and the fourth Ms. Marvel is an Inhuman who idolizes the fifth Captain Marvel like the way the first Ms. Marvel admired the first Captain Marvel, Blue Marvel had a relationship with the second Captain Marvel, and Marvel Girl is completely unrelated in exception for a connection with the first Ms. Marvel that’s a real stretch.**",gzxq7iy,t3_nnm9zx,/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/nnm9zx/the_marvels_new_logo_revealed/gzxq7iy/,5,MarvelStudiosSpoilers,False,0,2021-05-30

BrunoRB11,"Or the next ""Incredible Hulk""...

- China is against this movie;
- Nobody (except hardcore comic fans) knows who he is;
- He doesn't have superpowers, which is something that unless It is a really popular character (Batman, Black Widow, Captain America), really impacts the interest of a lot of casuals;
- There is a lot of people hating China on the West;
- Most of the world will be recovering from the COVID financial loss, so people might not be eager to spend money on a ""nameless hero movie"";
- Most of the world might still be closed because of COVID.

Unfortunaly (except for the superpowers part) everything else can be also be said about Eternals, which still has the advantage of a very popular cast. Not going to talk about the quality of any of those movies, as I haven't watched them yet, but I also doubt that they will be near Black Phanter on this regard.

Honestly, the only movie that I can see doing really well at the box office this year is Spider-Man, and that is because he is Spider-Man (most popular hero in the world), will probably have a live action Spider-Verse plot, the return of old actors on the same role everyone loved and is going to tie to Multiverse of Madness.

NightweaselX,"The synergy has died down considerably.  For instance, for WandaVision they just issued a trade collecting the old Vision and Scarlet Witch series.  They did publish a Falcon and Winter Soldier series, but Sam isn't back to being Cap.  It looks like the only thing for She-Hulk may be a trade.  Black Widow is still alive, so is Tony, and Steve is still 'young.'  There is an Eternals comic, but so far it's not affecting anything else.

If you were to pick up a series, Immortal Hulk would be the series to get.  You can just grab the trades and enjoy it.  It's had some one shots, but I believe those are in the trades.  Otherwise, it's self contained.  Unlike Hickman's X-Men.....and honestly, unless you've got MU, I'd just sit it out for now.  We'll see what happens by the end of the year, but it looks like things may be about halfway done.  If so, once it is finished, there will most definitely be the 'must read' lists you can hit rather than reading all the titles or getting all the trades, etc.

Other than that, it depends on what characters you like really.  If you're a Venom fan, you'll probably love Cates' run on the title which is ending soon.  Thompson has had a decent run on Captain Marvel.  Zdarsky's Daredevil is also highly recommended, but so is Soule's which started after Secret Wars so you could read it and then head straight to Zdarsky's run.  You can also pick up his Spider-Man: Life Story in trade.  If you liked Runaways, there's been a good run under Rowell that's still going.  If you liked Al Ewing's stuff, he's on GotG now doing his cosmic thing.  There was All New Wolverine by Tom Taylor if you like X-23.  If you liked Aaron's Thor run before SW, he finished it up so you could finish reading that.  There are other series, but again, don't know what characters you like.

There have been a lot of misses as well, and Amazing Spider-Man under Spencer has dragged on for far too long.  People believe it is ending soon, so there may be lists of core books to read to get the gist of the story.  Aaron's Avengers is......not well received.  The X-Men stuff after SW and before Hickman is hit or miss, unfortunately mostly miss, but there were a few bright spots.  The Inhumans have pretty much faded away, so that push is over.  Iron Man also has been hit or miss, mostly misses with wasted potential.",h00etb8,t3_noj627,/r/comicbooks/comments/noj627/has_marvel_improved_since_secret_wars_if_so_where/h00etb8/,3,comicbooks,False,0,2021-05-30

I’ll be brutally honest, I’m marginally more interested in the fantastical world that the Eternals will bring to the table than the Mystical Martial arts world that Shang-Chi will intrigue us to.

But in terms of a single individual across both casts, I’m personally most supportive of Simu Liu joining the MCU.

ctb33391,"If you don't like the models there are a lot of third-party alternative sites - I can personally vouch for Mantic and Warlord for example. The Eternals, Ironjawz and StD are really the only thicc armour dudes for the most part, and there's absolutely nothing but tournament rules and stuck-up losers stopping you from using wood elves in place of some of the Sylvaneth models. You can also go halfs with someone - keep the orcs and let a mate have the Sigmarines. I've been thinking of doing a Living City army based on old WHFB Albion as an example of using alternative models, so swampy abominations and halfnaked bri'ish barbarians instead of ents and Holy Roman landsknechts.

WHFB/Army Project uses a similar Strength vs Toughness system to 40k for wound rolls. I like the simplicity of AoS due to the sheer lack of faff while still allowing some fancy mechanics, but to each their own. There's still objectives in AoS though, so you don't have to have a battle that's just ""big mosh in the middle of the board"", and camping/taking strategic points on the board is still just as important.

Only buy what you want to buy with the models. I know the rules but don't actually play the game, I just buy factions like the Bonereapers and the upcoming Kruleboyz because I love the look of them. They may be gathering dust a bit on a shelving unit, but they're looking good and reminding me of all the fun I had making them up whilst they do so. You like the Spitegrove? Go get the Spitegrove. Even if they turn out to be trash like other BR named battalions *cough cough* Horrek's Dreadlance *cough cough* you still get your angry trees.",gzzkvay,t3_no8ehc,/r/ageofsigmar/comments/no8ehc/talk_me_into_starting_age_of_sigmar/gzzkvay/,2,ageofsigmar,False,0,2021-05-30
