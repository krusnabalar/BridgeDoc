labbla,I actually think I'd be more excited for Captain Marvel 2 than I am for Endgame. I too keep on forgetting it exists. But the big snap didn't do much for me and I can't care too much about heroes getting dusted.Infinity War and Endgame look to be missing the fun of it all that a lot of Marvel movies do have. Being snapped out of existence by a dumb purple dude shouldn't be so dour. ,eih1hsa,t3_b0reju,/r/WeHateMovies/comments/b0reju/whm_onscreen_captain_marvel/eih1hsa/,1,WeHateMovies,,,2019-03-14

swatop,"Wishes for Anthem... hmm.. here should I start?

1. Endgame loot drops (yeah that would be nice). You know, endgame does not end when the players got their first legendary weapons... it starts when they start grinding for more and more of these weapon drops to find a version that actually has good inscriptions. For this to happen the endgame loot has to drop more frequently. That is the only way to keep the players engaged in the game
2. I wish the game would not tell me on every 2nd mission that I start (PC) that it can not read my pilot data. Yes, every 2nd activity since the Saturday patch shows this message and brings me instantly back to Fort Tarsis. 
3. I wish there was a reason to go into higher difficulties. There is none atm. The rewards do not get better. The additional time invested in higher difficulties is not worth it. 
4. I wish that certain inscriptions would show a value instead of an empty %. 
5. I wish quickplay would work. Instead of having one broken quickplay we have now two broken quickplays since the latest patch. 
6. I wish higher tier enemies (such as Titans, Ursix and even other legendary enemies) would have a significantly increased chance to drop masterwork items and legendaries. Higher rewards for higher difficulties.
7. I know that now all players will like this one now... but can you please make Titans difficult again? Maybe not as difficult as before but right now I can kill every Titan in less than 30 seconds (thats no joke). I thought that Titans are the biggest threat in the game but they actually are incredible weak meanwhile.

&amp;nbsp;

Thats it for atm. I bring up another or the same wishlist next week (depending on if any changes were done).

Kahbekat,"I just got into Ultra Sun a couple weeks ago. It's way easier than most pokemon games up to the final boss. I don't know why people say it is bad, I remember my friends say Sun/Moon was bad but Ultra is way better and now I hear everyone say they are all bad.

All I have to say is if Gen 1 is baseline then Gen 2 was hard, Gen 3 was normal, Gen 4 was normal, Gen 5 was hard, Gen 6 was easy and Gen 7 is easy. I am basing this on pokemon leveling and story progression speed. I played through all of the games I have again over the last year and I think Gen 2 was probably the most I've ever had to grind in a pokemon game where Gen 7 I was overpowered from Route 2 onwards. At the same time, with a perfect team all the games can be beaten without effort, none of them are ""hard games"".

That being said I don't think that makes them bad games. I thoroughly enjoyed all the pokemon games so far. Gen 2 and 5 have arguably the most endgame content and HGSS remakes are considered the best Pokemon games  made and that makes sense considering they are still almost full price 10 years later. Gen 4 and ORAS have decent endgame and the others are less.

WhinersArePussies,"aka LogicalTech

Not very succinct are you.  The content of your post betrays your claim of loving the game.  At the very least, show some integrity and explicitly say that you hate Anthem, Bioware, and EA.  It would give more meaning to a very wordy but otherwise not well thought out post.

Saying Anthem has bugs that are not game breaking is a legitimate complaint. Saying that you don't like the story, writing, or pacing is a reasonable opinion. Saying that Anthem lacks content is uninformed at best and malicious at worst.

Anthem has a full campaign.  Anthem has multiple side missions and contracts.  Anthem has three very well-designed and extremely fun to play strongholds that take a fair amount of time to complete when you're not trying to cheese them on easy with God level gear (which is actually quite an awesome experience btw).  Anthem has six levels of difficulty. Anthem has a rewarding loot system that always feeds you better gear with each mission as you are leveling up and gives you plenty of God roll items when you begin receiving Masterworks.  Anthem's loot system is not perfect, but it is not broken either.

Anthem has meaningful NPC storylines with streamlined dialogue choices that are not overwhelming and don't take forever to complete.  There are plenty of achievements. There are a ton of easy to extremely hard challenges with meaningful rewards worth chasing. The flight mechanics never get old. The combo mechanics are amazing. And gunplay is as good as any third person shooter that I've played and becomes incredibly important in the endgame when all of the masterwork weapons and components with crazy buffs start dropping. 

All told, Anthem has between 55-60 hours of pre-endgame content (not including strongholds) if you follow the guided path that Bioware lays out for you.

I have almost 190 hours logged on PC and over 40 hours on PS4, and I'm not bored.  I play the game for several hours every weeknight and even more on weekends.  I don't need to wait until April to give Anthem a fair review.  It's an f-ing Masterpiece in spite of its bugs and a few questionable story choices (Haluk, Monitor, Strider, I'm looking at you). 

And as far as value, do the math and simply divide $60 by the number of hours I've played.  And did I mention that all of my time in Anthem has been in 1 of 4 javelins that all play very differently?

So if you want to enjoy an amazing, slow-paced narrative driven masterpiece with very clunky combat mechanics that is set in the Old West, play RDR2. But if you want to enjoy a very fast-paced action driven masterpiece with amazing combat mechanics that make you feel like a God in a sci-fi Power Fantasy, then play Anthem.

Then why not appear identified in the inventory to save us from the trouble of pointing to the scroll, clicking it, pointing to the item and clicking again just to view one item (out of tens of thousands, and be disappointed...

Julch,"Already posted this in another thread but after getting super burned on Anthem, here's the solution :

&amp;#x200B;

 

After  being hyper critical of The Division 2 I finally took the plunge  because my hunger for a proper looter shooter was too intense after the sorry outing of Anthem.

All I can say is - just do the switch.

\- You will miss the suits.

\- You will miss the flying.

\- You will miss the short ability cooldowns.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

But you gain SO MUCH.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- You will get about 10x the amount of content (not even kidding it's probably even more if you take everything into account).

\-  You will get proper loot and TONS of it (it's insane, after playing for  like 20 mins I will be drowning in loot and have to take a couple  minutes to sort out what I want, what I might want to upgrade / reforge  (WHICH YOU CAN - who'd have thought this feature would be a rare thing  to see) and what I want to sell / dismantle (which I can do almost  anywhere - fast and quick and with multi dismantling / selling to boot) -  Honestly the loot is just day and night. Coming from Anthem I'm legit  at a loss for words when I see how freakishly fun the loot in Division 2  is...it's insane and really sad at the same time.

\- You will get waypoints that work flawlessly even in a group.

\-  You will get text chat, disability features, the whole shebang ! And  you can turn it off and on - it's a basic functionality  but it fucking  works and is so good..holy shit never thought I'd miss text chat in a  game...(especially public chat / general chat where the whole server  gets together to meme it out)

\- You get  easy grouping, clans (guilds), quickplay (and guess what, it works),  you get freeplay solo or with groups and you can drop in  / out at any  time -- again the night and day difference in functionality between  Anthem and Division 2 is mind-boggling - you can even teleport to  members at any time really quick...grouping done right !

\-  You get an insanely deep and well crafted cosmetic system with tons of  options on launch, a store with featured items at a discount but all  items unlocked - exactly what we've been clamoring for and the color  game is also very strong in the Division 2 (and the MTX are fair and you  get free shit for playing).

\- You get way more weapons (subtypes and just generally) that you can mod to your leisure (and even color).

\-  You get a huge seamless world with legit no real loading screens other  than at the start or when you quick travel (and then they're super  short).

\- You get funny secrets to explore / find.

\-  You get tons of world events (TONS ! You legit can't do them all since  they're dynamic and the world is chock full of them to begin with),  proper bounties, different endgame activities that are ever changing,  just content that almost drowns you due to how much there is.

\-  You get proper endgame scaling - even the bullet sponginess isn't as  bad as I thought it would be (it's still a bit ridiculous at times but  eh nature of the beast somewhat and Anthem GM3 is hell in comparison).

\- You get PvP (in case you want that, I'm not a huge fan but hey it's there and it has its own skill tree).

\- You get Skill trees (man I missed skill trees).

The  list goes on and on but honestly...the difference of polish between  these two games is staggering. I want to love Anthem but now that I've  played the Division 2 I'm just over it. I doubt Anthem will ever even  get close to this amount of content and polish. While they're trying to  get to a reasonably playable state of the game Division 2 is already in  full swing and picking up even more steam.

If  you want a looter shooter done right, or just a REALLY well done loot  based game, play the Division 2. I'd rate their  loot ""game"" even higher  than Diablo 3 because you drown in loot but it's still meaningful and  the diversity is insane. I constantly have this gigantic grin while  playing because I get rewarded nonstop, my monkey brain is in overdrive  while the game throws shinies at me that I then get to dismantle /  upgrade / sidegrade / sell / equip / theorycraft - in short it's a wild  ride and I can't wait to play more. (I'm only posting this due to a  short server shutdown for the latest patch fixing some critical issues)

So come on over to the Division 2 - you will most likely be happy with your purchase ;)",eihwjt5,t3_b0s7n2,/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b0s7n2/im_not_even_boycotting_i_just_dont_want_to_play/eihwjt5/,1,AnthemTheGame,,,2019-03-14

ScrapBrain,"I think all the speculating about Captain Marvel's power level in the MCU is detrimental, tbh. I think we'll get a better look at how her powers are developing in Endgame; I don't think she's the end-all that's going to just fly in and take Thanos down, that would be anticlimactic and boring. They spent an entire movie showing how powerful Thanos is, and while Captain Marvel can fly, and has cool powers, to me it looked like her power is about the equivalent to Thor, who couldn't take Thanos down solo until he caught him off guard and still managed to fail (a mistake Thanos isn't likely to make twice). It should also be mentioned that her power coming from the Space stone means that her powers are limited to a fraction of its output, all of which Thanos controls with the gauntlet (it's possible that he could reverse it if he put 2 and 2 together during a fight), and for all we know her powers are diminished because Thanos used the gauntlet/stone, who knows? I think her appearance in Endgame is likely to tip the scales for the heroes, but if the filmmakers are smart it'll be a battle of wits where Thanos needs to be outsmarted to get the stones/gauntlet from him to enact whatever plan they have. 

As for possible villains for CM to fight in a sequel, any hero or villain is only as strong or as weak as the writer allows them to be. Any villain can be changed or amped up for a movie, and CM's powers can fluctuate based on plot devices or just for plot convenience (or if they're smart, nullifying their powers with tough choices, for [a very basic] example - a villain grabs a powerful device that the hero needs from a ship set to self destruct, the hero has to choose between chasing the escaping villain, or saving the people on the ship. The villain is probably going to escape at the last second. All the power the hero has and they cannot pursue based on their personal morals. The villain doesn't even need powers to do this, just smarts, and that's more compelling than ""I'm big and tough. You're big and tough. We're big and tough, let's fight!"")

ipeeonbees,"I think you're right about the Faith of the Seven. We don't ever see any miraculous acts attributed to them.

In the show, it seems like the Drowned God is also bullshit. Victarion's whole deal suggests something is there in the books, but since they opted not to include him in the show, it likely won't matter very much in the endgame. 

Jon was definitely resurrected by the Red God, by my reckoning. This R'hollor dude seems responsible for most of the magic stuff in the show, and may well be evil.

The Many-Faced God might be antithetical to the Red God, given how freaked out Melisandre was by Arya. - Weirdly, when Jaquen is first introduced, he identifies as a worshiper of the Red God for some reason that hasn't been adequately explained to me. 

The Old Gods are tied up in the magic of the COTF and First Men. I don't think that they are literally Gods, but inaccurate interpretations of this magic made by ignorant people. 

It is likely that the show will leave these questions unanswered or provide a stupid answer like: ""The red God and Many Faced God are different sides of Bran's Conscience.""",eih8hlj,t3_b0uc5s,/r/freefolk/comments/b0uc5s/lets_workshop_a_theory_the_faith_of_the_seven_is/eih8hlj/,1,freefolk,,,2019-03-14

StygianSavior,"&gt; But of Org A bought a fleet and Org B has to grind one, Org A is advantaged no?

Yeah.  They will.

But it's kind of a necessary evil for the game to exist.

And imo, if flight ready ship sales stop when the game releases, it's an acceptable compromise.


&gt; I guess I don't see the point of even having a fleet or being in a org with one if there is no point to it as so many seem to say. Why have a fleet at all, what is there to fight for? What are we going to use these fleets for? If there is no reason to have fancy ships because there is no use for them, what is the point?

There's the whole endgame economy thing.  And now surface outposts, so there will be a base building element as well.


That's why the p2w argument is imo kind of ridiculous.  Because the min/maxers will be the *PVP Orgs*.  Like, a small subsection of a small subsection of the player base.  There will be plenty of other Orgs focused on the PVE aspects of the game (like outpost building, mining, trading, exploration) that won't give a crap about trying to follow some meta by buying and selling entire ships.  Because if a trade Org's current escorts are enough to beat back or deter NPC pirates and the very rare PVP attack, then they're good enough.


There will likely be a separate meta for these PVE focused Orgs for things like trade ship cargo capacity and whatnot, but it won't be competitive the way a PVP meta is.  At the end of the day, it won't really effect you if someone else has the best cargo hauling ship.


I dunno; I guess I just don't see what's worth getting bent out of shape about when it comes to buying ship in SC.  There literally would not be a game without the funding that came from being able to buy ships.",eih1tl2,t3_b0r8gg,/r/starcitizen/comments/b0r8gg/the_p2w_discussion/eih1tl2/,1,starcitizen,,,2019-03-14

* ok, after the release there would rise some connectivity issues and that's ok, no problem at all, it happens, too many players all at once, it's fine by me, it would get sorted out anytime soon.
* but why are so many bugs in the game that directly affect and ruin gameplay experience? Can you imagine the report people responsable for testing the game actually delivered? ""Sometimes when I enter a mission my health bar is all messed up"", ""I enter a mission and I'm already at the boss"", ""Whan I die I sit there for an infinite amount of time without being able to do anything"", ""I farmed this weapon for 20h but it has a 1% damage inscription on it"", ""Increasing the dificulty to absurd levels didn't change anything on the rewards system"", ""When I'm on a mission an invisible wall prevents me to go further"", ""A stronghold vanished from my map and I had to enter someone's else game for it to reappear"", ""Our PS4 used for testing is rebooting during gameplay"", etc.  


Are they really going to say that these problems that are plaguing THOUSANDS of players NEVER happened in 6+ YEARS of development and testing and only now they're seeing this? If they knew about those at the moment of the release why did they still release the game like this anyway? They'll never give an answer like: ""We rushed things to be able to release on schedule and many bugs were overviewed in our product. We're sorry you're going through this at the moment."". I don't even care about the loot system being all messed up, the store having only 1 item worth buying at time and the lack of endgame content.

I was really scoping out the John Wick figure but someone mention that it’s a subjectively simple figure design for the same price as other figures with more complex designs. So now I’m hoping to get a figure from Spider-Man Far From Home or Avengers: Endgame.  

Those are long term figures but I’m hoping to get (and build) some custom figures in the meantime. I think I’m going to buy a phicen model and a set of clothes with 1 or 2 weapons. Just to get a taste for 1/6 scale figures you know ?

Still playing FFRK but i'm a bit behind endgame (i hesitate to drop it... i'm torn).

Tried and dropped : KHuX (mostly because they banned emulator use and it's my main playing tool) tried to get back, and was completely at a lost and desinstalled quicker than it took me to download everything (seriously it took me hours to get it load everything)

overlordbabyj,"Just want to point out that the common depiction of time travel in fiction started with H. G. Wells' The Time Machine, which came 20 years before Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, which informs the modern scientific understanding of time (i.e. time is a dimension tied to space, not a linear sequence of events). Therefore, the ""butterfly effect"" actually has no scientific basis, thus there are other ways to depic time travel. Since actual quantum physicists served as consultants for the Quantum Realm, I bet the time travel in Endgame will follow the Einstein route.

cypherhalo,"Is there a point to responding? Sigh, might as well give it a go. 

Okay so . . . 

I don’t run only tyrant mine. I vary activities. I play games for fun not to be super “efficient “ man. 

The loot is really interesting and every new masterwork I get gives me ideas for a new build. I have a combo focused Colossus build that doesn’t even use guns for the damage but instead for buffs. I equipped a Lurker MW just for the armor regen perk even though I hate the Lurker. Have ideas for a build to make around that weapon. Need to keep experimenting. Have barely touched the other three javelins so if I get sick of a Colossus, plenty else to play. 

Pretty typical content for a looter shooter and the best story of the genre, easily beating Destiny or Division. I couldn’t even care less about any alleged downscaling from trailers. Game is gorgeous and trailers are marketing pap, we know this. I play Monster Hunter World where the endgame is just keep fighting the same monsters forever and ever. I can tell you their favorite spots to spawn and where they go to rest when they’re dying from memory. Anthem has more variety than MHW. 

So, amazing combat and combo system and a ton of interesting builds. Yeah, I’d say the fundamentals are good. More cosmetics are obviously on the way. Bugs need to be squashed. Loot needs to be worked on. More content is obviously on the way. To each their own, I’m just going to enjoy playing Anthem.

I headshotted someone with the Kraber and did 187 damage. Due to the distance, they were able to get into cover and shield/heal.

I really do think that a headshot with a Kraber should be an instant kill, or an instant down at the very least. It is one of the rarest weapons in the game with a low mag/ammo count and a slow reload animation - this is obviously offset with the high damage it does.

I believe if you are skilled enough to get a headshot with the STRONGEST WEAPON in the game, you should be rewarded with a kill.

While there may be a bit of luck in getting a headshot, player skill has a larger influence.

There is absolutely no skill involved in locating a helmet and picking it up. Helmets really aren't that difficult to find and most people will have good helmets near endgame.

Zeydon,"&gt;I don't know why you're getting defensive about it. 

Apologies for coming across that way - I hadn't fully shifted tone from the comment I'd made [immediately before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/b13cpj/facts/eij0xhh/?context=3&amp;st=jt9deiow&amp;sh=6f1cf8b9)

&gt;but it matters much less because chapo is a comedy podcast that isn't deliberately seeking out and doing explicit talks/lectures/debates on politics and theory

I agree that chapo gets leeway due to being a comedy podcast  - I just feel like Hasan's stream fills a similar niche, and thus would be allowed the same type of leeway.  He'll play [in depth vids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1eOVU61mZE) on his stream even if he's not going quite so in depth himself.  And it's twitch, so it's more relaxed, so like you can play games or something while its on the other screen.

Not saying you're wrong by and large, I just took issue with this part I guess:

&gt;but if he ends up being all budding leftists take in for their theory, he will lead people to settle in succdemery, vague ineffectual anarchism, or shudders trotskyism.

because I see him more as a gateway to other sources (just like Chapo) in addition to his content rather than the endgame. I guess I'm just optimistic he'll nudge people in the right direction.

&gt;Destiny... is good for digging yourself out of that hole and being a little more critical

Agreed, you gotta climb that ladder one step at a time, and Destiny is a a valuable rung.

&gt;I know for YouTube people if they're right wingers Contrapoints is very good. She's good for libs too, but is a lib herself so she's not gonna radicalize people.

Natalie is great, yeah, though I don't think she's pro-capitalism exactly.

Tmoney1013,"I agree with you that they probably won’t show up in endgame. However, I do think that the celestials will be introduced at some point. Along the MCU’s entire lifespan they have been getting more and more “out there.” At the start it was just science and stuff on Earth. Then they slowly brought in more space. After that was magic. Hell, the celestials already exist in the MCU as seen in GotG 1&amp;2. And with Adam Warlock being teased I don’t think it’s too far “out there” for them to bring in the celestials eventually.

Lurtz_Of_Orthanc,"Great post! I currently own all MCU variants of Iron Man after far, far too much collecting, and maintain a spreadsheet of them - a few notes for your gallery:

-MK 43 (Partial) from the recently revealed Avengers Tower promo should be included, as it is the 3rd existing variant of the MK 43

-""MK 51"" is generally referred to as MK 85. As you correctly state, everything is conjecture to some degree, but this seems to be the predominant nomenclature until the movie hits.

-Quantum Realm Iron Man comes in the upcoming DUM-E polybag if you want an image that isn't stitched together.

-The Micro Iron Man, due to the circular chest RT and gold detailing, is very likely the Mark 43 due to the fact that the set's heroes appear to be their Age of Ultron outfits (Hawkeye has sleeves, Cap isn't wearing bright blue). But there's no definitive answer for that one.

-You might want to include MCU Iron Spider on the list since it's a direct product of Tony's like the War Machine and Legionnaire suits. I personally also lump in the 4 Ultron versions that exist just for the comprehensive MCU slate. 

-With the handful of comicbook versions at the end, I don't know how you count Detroit Steel, Comics Iron Spider, and Iron Skull, but those might be worth adding as well if comics are part of the conversation - that's very subjective though. 

Again, great work on the image gallery - after Endgame there's likely going to be a little lull in the Iron Man figure releases (since he doesn't appear in any FFH sets) for the rest of 2019 so it's a great time for people to try and catch up on a full collection!",eijzmyo,t3_b14dcj,/r/lego/comments/b14dcj/list_of_all_minifig_iron_man_and_war_machine/eijzmyo/,1,lego,,,2019-03-15

ThePortalHopper,"Destiny 2 is a fun game starting out. There's a level 20 cap with around a 265 Light cap without the DLC, and with all of the DLC (Curse of Osiris, Warmind, and Forsaken) get you to a level 50 cap with 650+ Light cap. There are a few soft caps though, meaning you won't be getting higher Light gear until you start a few things, like raids or DLC. After you reach 500 Light, the soft cap hits and you'll have to find Prime Engrams or **Powerful Gear** in mission rewards. Overall, the game is fun even by yourself for long while. The story is a decent 7.5/10, and Forsaken brings it up to about an 8.5/10. Starting off, it's a little slow. But as soon as you get to other planets like Titan or Io, the game really gets going. Especially after beating the main campaign and going into the Forsaken Campaign. Endgame content is there, but the replayability for the raids and other endgame events start to get tiring, unless you're with friends. For 60 dollars right now, base game with all of the DLC (besides the annual pass DLC), I'd say it's worth it for the amount of time you'll be playing it.

darthmarth28,"The internet loves wanking over tier systems and the OP-ness of full casters, but honestly raw DPS is extremely important and very underappreciated. 2H Fighter is OP at low levels, but remains useful and extremely threatening through endgame.

The Fighter's most glaring weakness is the low Will save. If you can patch that up with a small initial investment in Wisdom, Iron Will, and some quality magic items, you're pretty much good to go. Depending on the GM, game style, and party composition, you may also need to worry about skill ranks, but there are a surprisingly large number of ways for a Fighter to pick those up with ""use your BAB instead of skill ranks for X skill"" features.

Get your hands on some Gloves of Dueling, Big 6 whenever they drop, and dedicate your leftovers to utility items that will let you move faster or act in situations where normally you wouldn't. Check in with your fellow players every couple levels and ask them ""how would you fight an enemy with my skill set?"", then buy potions or permanent items that let you address those situations.

AndresProphecy,"It’s definitely a big purchase for me in general, the last non-essential purchase that big was my PS4 and I play it everyday. But for a while now I’ve had 2 really cool gaming statues on my shelf and every time someone would come over they would compliment it. 

So for a bit I was into statues and had a few in mind but never bought them because I found a new interest in 1:6 scale figures. Seeing a statue in the same pose everyday can get somewhat tiring so that’s why I made the switch. I can’t lie, it took me about 2 years to finally accept the costs of these figures. 

$260 is still a lot for me, but with the payment plan, I can save up for it and pay a little each month. 

Even though this is the first figure I preorder, I am currently scoping out others and hoping for more figures to come out of Endgame. I think 3 figures would be my stopping point for a while. 

Honestly, if you like the movie and figure design you should go for it. I fell in love with the figure first even though I had no knowledge of Captain Marvel. Me thinking about buying the figure made me go buy some comic books and watch the movie. Now I love everything about her, and when I got him I made an account and got her. 

If it’s your first purchase you get $15 off and get some store credit for future purchases.

baconshoplifter,"The pros of neural networks is that they in theory can learn anything that is learnable. Universal approximator and all that mumbo jumbo.

The cons of neural networks is that you need a lot of data and you need a lot of resources. We're talking many orders of magnitude more of data and resources.

Real world is not theoretical. Sometimes the data simply does not exist and it is impossible to collect more. If you have 1000 customers then that's what you have. If the company has been around on the stock market for 2000 days then that's all you have.

Deep learning is ""endgame"". Given enough data and enough resources, it WILL outperform anything else. The thing is, very rarely you have enough data to outperform and usually you'll get something like LASSO regression or some other stupidly simple method giving you as good results as something extremely complicated because there simply isn't enough data.

Explainable machine learning is a bit more complicated than trying to interpret some feature importance values or weights. Some algorithm telling you that a feature is important doesn't necessarily mean it actually is important.",eikal3y,t3_azw5t1,/r/datascience/comments/azw5t1/question_deep_learning_vs_traditional_machine/eikal3y/,1,datascience,,,2019-03-15

AGOTFAN,"&gt;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows pt 2 clearly spells out the stakes with words on the screen ""only one can live"" and with narration ""C'mon Tom, let's finish this the way we started. Together."" and hell they even showed the words ""The Epic Conclusion"" on the screen. THE EPIC CONCLUSION.

This is not a good analogy.

Both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings trailers can spell out the outcome (""only one can live"") and show great battles, but it's because everyone who have bought and read those tens of millions of HP and LoTR already knew what the ending will be. We all knew Harry Potter and Frodo Will survive. They could afford to make trailers as grandiose and revealing as could be.

Meanwhile, apart from the filmmakers, NO ONE knows what the ending of Endgame will be. And the Marvel is particularly careful not to show too much that will anger fans and audience because of spoilers.

Again, Endgame is unprecedented. The stakes is already very high without them even showing it.",eikbrgn,t3_b0zkli,/r/boxoffice/comments/b0zkli/other_marvel_studios_avengers_endgame_official/eikbrgn/,1,boxoffice,,,2019-03-15

inertia709,"This is one of the few times I can tell you that you are objectively wrong. A point of confusion about elec is that it's a better choice on fast weapons - when comparing to multiplicative brands like flaming/freezing, it's actually the *base damage* that determines which brand is better, and broad axes only have one more point of base damage than demon tridents/blades, which most players agree work best with elec. The other point that players miss is just how high the bonus damage from elec really is - people have run the experiments (using wiz mode + fsim) and it turns out that flaming/freezing only beat elec on executioner's axes with high (well over 20) fighting, axes and strength (yes, this means that even a weapon as heavy as a battleaxe does better with elec!)

Here's a rough calculation showing that elec beats flaming/freezing on broad axes:

* Broad axe damage: 1d13 base times a multiplier of about 2  on average (exact number is 2.04 assuming fighting/axes/strength of about 27/18/30) plus 1d9 from slaying - roughly 2*1d13 + 1d9 or 19 damage on average
* flaming/freezing: +25% of damage *after* AC damage reduction - about +5 damage vs AC 0, +3.5 damage for AC 10, etc.
* elec: +7+1d13 damage 1/3 of the time, about +5 damage on average

Keep in mind that this is only a rough calculation that assumes you character has endgame skills and stats on a fully-enchanted broad axe: for most of the game, elec will fare even better relative to flaming/freezing.",eikg04g,t3_b0vcdl,/r/dcss/comments/b0vcdl/need_help_mennas/eikg04g/,1,dcss,,,2019-03-15

Anthem caught my eye because of flying and abilities. Leveled out and grinned in end game for 10 more hrs and deleted the game as enemy scaling, level design, damage numbers etc are all shit. Tried Division 2 beta and bought gold edition. Nearly 20hrs and level 18, loving it so far.

I still enjoyed the heck out of Anthem till I reached the endgame but Division 2 enemy AI is so good to play against.

likeneonlove,"I'm a HUGE Ross and Rachel fan and they're the reason why I started watching Friends back when it was still on air, though I do get why newer audiences don't take to their relationship so much anymore. During the '90s, TV was all about the will-they-or-won't-they relationship drama, but as culture has shifted and society has progressed, we're a lot less idealistic when it comes to romance nowadays. Does it make me less of a fan of them? Not at all! I don't take the show out of context of the '90s and what I enjoy watching on television doesn't have to mirror my views in real life. TV is escapism and it's entertainment!

Ross and Rachel were iconic for their time and unless you experienced the show while it was airing, it's difficult to grasp just how loved and adored they were. Everyone went WILD for moments like their first kiss and the prom video and the show even started to lose viewers in season 6 and 7 when their relationship wasn't in focus anymore. When Rachel became pregnant in season 8 with Ross' baby, it reinvigorated Friends and ratings went back up again! The audience wanted them to get back together, the actors did and of course, even the writers! Ross and Rachel getting back together was always endgame and it was true to the show.

Ross and Rachel were written to be kept apart until the very end because the majority of the drama and conflict of the show derived from them. Without conflict, there's no story to tell. Monica and Chandler work because they balanced out their drama and neither couple were sustainable without each other. Also, Ross and Rachel BOTH did terrible things to each other and ALL the characters had some pretty questionable flaws! Ross' flaws have probably aged the most in 2019, but to me, he's just a character and not a real life person!

And yes! Friends is an AMAZING show! It ended the way it was supposed to and for that reason, it's been my favourite show for almost 20 years. :)",eioeo7t,t3_azmwhd,/r/friends_tv_show/comments/azmwhd/lets_all_be_honest_here/eioeo7t/,1,friends_tv_show,,,2019-03-16
ChiefBr0dy,"Well, more than any of that I would just like my time and effort recognised by the game. I don't really care about being the best or anything like that. I mainly play solo and well, quite frankly, I'm really sick of these two strongholds (and the final mission recycle). The repetition of the tiny amount of endgame content in this game could at least be alleviated if the our time playing it didn't so frequently feel so underwhelming and unrewarding. I'm just looking for clear avenues in which to achieve my goals and with a degree of consistency, that's all

If a looter shooter title is going to ship with hardly anything to do once one hits its arbitrary level cap, here it's 30, then the least it can do is make playing the small handful of missions over and over again more consistently worthwhile. Otherwise, I personally see no point in it.

Everyone always wants to go max range with her and Silence suffers from that, since the stun only lasts for a few seconds and cannot be recast, so the only way you can re stun is by moving away from the enemy so that the radius of the ability no longer touches them. This is often not only impractical with how large the radius of the ability is, but sometimes impossible depending on the map you are at. So what's the solution?    

Use less range. And while we are at it less duration.    

Believe it or not, Banshee functions just in most cases uses her default ability range for her 1 2 and 3, which are her most important abilities.

Her 1 has 15m default range at max rank. It's able to constantly ragdoll enemies soon as their are hit by it and the Augment allows for complete armor stripping. This is on of her least used, but powerful abilities with endgame weapons.
 
Her 2 has a default 35m radius, which is a lot larger than folks realize. This ability can spread upon killing a target inflicted by it already at a weakpoint, creating another 35m application of it from the point the enemy died. That's more than enough range to spread it simply by strategically sniping/throwing a wide aoe blast at a weakpoint inflicted target. You dont need to have a 100m Sonar hitting enemies 3 rooms away when the effective combat range for most people is about 25-30m.     

Her 3 has a base range of 20m. This is pretty close to the range where most people's weapons have the best accuracy or melee users can get in with a quick sprint, roll or bullet jump. By keep the range at 20m, you only stun enemies when they are close enough to kill, not several rooms away where you can't even see them, and have plenty of time to dispatch them by hitting one of the weakpoints you created with your 2. If for some reason the enemy is not killed by the time your 2 wears off, a quick sprint, roll or bullet jump will put you far enough away that the enemy will be out of her 3 radius, and moving back in will reapply the stun. You also can simply just use her 1 to knock the enemy down and kill it.     

Using Fleeting Expertise, you can significantly reduce the costs of her abilities to the point where Zenurik regen can cover repeated use, while still having a 12s duration on her 2 and 3 that lasts long enough to get the job done.

The Division was a technical mess and fairly boring endgame wise in the first year and a bit.

mattlistener,"Trying this query again on the DQ thread.

I'm a new player.   I have a perfectly good desktop set up with ffxiv, playing with an xbox360 controller.  But the thing is, I spend much of my evenings hanging out on the couch with my sweetie while she crochets.  No room there for a desktop or desk.  

So realistically, 80% of my gaming time is going to be spent playing something I can play on a laptop (+ controller).  I’d like to see if that chunk of time can be ffxiv too.  If I ever do endgame content, the desktop is there to cover it.  

So, now I’m shopping for a laptop.  This will be my first-ever PC purchase.  (The aforementioned desktop is a newish imac running Windows in bootcamp, which plays ffxiv just fine.)  I would be still using the xbox360 controller to play on the laptop.

All the recommend laptops I'm seeing have a left-of-center keyboard and touchpad, in order to accomodate a number pad on the right.  I don’t anticipate interacting with the touchpad much to play ffxiv, but I would use the laptop for other things and having the keyboard and touchpad offcenter is just not going to work for me.

SO... with a ""no numberpad, centered touchpad"" requirement in mind, is there a laptop folks would recommend for FFXIV?  I'm looking to spend in the $1K - $1.5K range.

fncompthrowaway1218,"It really has nothing to do with the RNG or loot pool. In fact, I think early game loot RNG is in a really good state right now with the recent changes to rarities. I'm getting AR, AK, smg, shotgun off spawn majority of the time off drop now. And early game certainly takes skill too. After all, that's how pros begin to ""own"" a drop spot. By being really good at dominating it.

So it has nothing to do with early game being bad. It's just that endgame is ***so good*** in comparison. There's literally no other gaming experience that's similar to a stacked endgame with moving circles. Like you said, you can compare early game to PUBG. But what game can be compared to endgame?

I'm also not for removing early game or midgame. A lot of people want to discard BR, and keep talking about an ""arena mode"" (not sure if they know what the definition of arena mode is because that doesn't make any sense, but that's been the general way to describe a non-BR Fortnite). People have said they like turtle wars and these new zone wars games, cause they can skip to the endgame and play a lot. But I think that's a case of wanting to eat dessert before finishing your vegetables.

The BR format, the decisions you make in early to midgame, the ***economy*** you develop, your positioning/rotations all lead to the endgame. Stripping these makes for a fundamentally different experience lacking in a lot of gamesense.

Murphy_Nelson,"Both have huge challenges in terms of penetration.  


Let's star with Star Wars.  Asian markets are not remotely opposed to special effects and big action films, obviously.  But the nostalgia factor is absolutely missing.  And that's impossible to recreate.  


If superheroes were going to be a force in Europe, it would have happened already.  There have been SO many chances for big superhero films to buck the trend and break out.  I don't see what Endgame is going to do when so many have failed to be that ginormous break out hit, including all the lead up films.  Probably many factors here.  Costumed superheroes are seen as silly in Europe whereas they are cool in America.  Anything that reeks of ""AMERICA!"" typically underperforms across the pond, and most of these films have references to America that pass under American noses because they are subtle, but are very obvious to Europeans (I remember watching Spiderman 3 in a hostel in Swaziland with a bunch of British and Irish kids, and there's a scene where Spiderman swings past an American flag, and the whole room broke out into exasperated groans, like an ""oh my God not AGAIN"" type exasperation, whereas I wouldn't have even noticed it).  I feel with international cinema (and ESPECIALLY the French market, which is #3 in Europe for most studios behind UK and Germany respectively) there is a tendency to view themselves as high brow film goers more so than America, even if most of their domestic hits are dumb comedies (once again this is particularly pronounced in France).",eioa8wd,t3_b1t31n,/r/boxoffice/comments/b1t31n/int_superheroes_dominate_asia_star_wars_dominates/eioa8wd/,1,boxoffice,,,2019-03-16

Csenky,"Who said they ain't making enough? They obviously do. But longterm farming/collecting games are very different compared to arena-based games (where you start every match evenly like in a MOBA). The veteran players who log in every day will \_always\_ be ahead of new ones. I wouldn't give a shit if a new players would instantly get a full team of lv50 T8 characters to start off and be able to find an alliance in a few weeks. If I log in to MFF now, I get like multiple 6\* mastery characters of my choice, tons of mats and gold to upgrade them etc... Yes MFF is a 3-4 years old game, but that's exactly my point. Eventually we will have faster low-level progression so ppl can catch up, and this means big changes on the endgame as well. This is basic.

Now since this is inevitable, I think it cannot hurt to give them ideas about how to do this. We have weeks to come with new content, War, U7, Shuri, obviously these will be the big things for spring. I think Khasino was right to plant some ideas there, so they can understand what is wrong with the current system from a player perspective, and adjust their plans to match our needs.

Through normal play you should be pretty close to fully decked out in purple by about the time you hit 25, which is also when it first becomes possible for orange Masterworks to start dropping for you, but they will be very rare. From 25 to 30 you’ll mostly be getting higher-level purples, with maybe the occasional orange if you’re lucky. Once you hit 30, the level of your purple drops caps out, and your path to progression will be orange and yellow drops, for which you will need to start playing on Grandmaster difficulties, which are unlocked at 30. Grandmaster 1 doesn’t have great orange or yellow drop rates, but a small handful of tougher enemies do have a decent chance of dropping them, and you get a garunteed orange Component each time you complete a Legendary Contract on Grandmaster 1 or higher and a garunteed orange gear piece every time you complete a Stronghold on Grandmaster 1 or higher. Once you’re fully decked out in orange, it’s time to move on to Grandmaster 2 to improve your orange and yellow drop rates and start working on an endgame build, and once you have that, it’ll be time to love on to Grandmaster 3 to get the best drop rates, so you can start putting together more builds faster.",eiorvyc,t3_b1wj1e,/r/LowSodiumAnthem/comments/b1wj1e/ive_gotta_be_doing_something_wrong/eiorvyc/,1,LowSodiumAnthem,,,2019-03-16

FrigidNox,"For me it's a different issue. One of my best friends all the way from high school still games with me, but we shine when it's a game about tactics and strategy, not a game about story. He will incessantly skip every single cutscene, which is super annoying when the game is setup so that if one member of the party skips a cutscene, it skips for everyone else too. He doesn't care about the story or the why or any of that. In that regard, playing the Division 2 with him kind of sucks. 

However, where we shine is any game that involves some amount of tactics and working together. Online FPS games, especially Battlefield and Titanfall, those are an absolute *blast* with him. Large scale battles and long/difficult missions in the Division, those are a shitload of fun because he full understands all the different mechanics and abilities and knows how to complement my skills/abilities. 

It's tough, but unfortunately, I feel like until I get to the Division 2 endgame, I'm better off playing solo if I want to experience the excellent story that Division 2 is trying to tell.

OreoSwordsman,"It’s a bit more difficult to get mats in Rust as opposed to ARK. Raiders in ARK usually dump mats because they don’t need them and don’t need anyone uninvolved taking them and doing something with them that might hurt them in the long run. Also, despawning after victory is a bit different than despawning because you know you’re going to lose and are salty about losing (or not fighting at all, or getting raided to begin with) just to be toxic. 

People despawn shit in Rust when they’re getting raided to leave everyone with nothing and then they typically gloat about it. It ruins the fun of the game for a lot of the community, since the endgame of Rust is to get boom and apply the boom to your adversaries in the hopes of getting more scrap to research shit.

PatrickMcWhorter,"&gt; And one thing characteristic of those is that things do not go as planned or expected. Major players get taken out totally unexpectedly (Red Wedding, Drogo, Tywin…), the power balance suddenly shifts utterly (Cersei blowing everything up; Dany gaining dragons), 

But there are Chekov's guns for each of these events.

&gt;but a lot of these people will find that they die long before the story is over (Ned).

Chekov's dead dire wolf.

&gt;Elaborate plans don’t come to fruition at all (Dorne, Highgarden).

Plans that are revealed beforehand seldom pan out in nearly every work of fiction

&gt;But this does not mean that every piece he puts on the board will have a direct, strong impact on the endgame.

There are disposable pawns, to be sure.

&gt;. It doesn’t mean he looks at people like pieces at all; if he only had the pieces he needed to wrap up the story on the table, he wouldn’t be getting so damn lost in it that we are meanwhile all doubting he’ll get done at all.

Aw contrare. He's playing an elaborate game. The people are pieces. Chess can get confusing.

&gt;There will totally be shaggydog characters (Rickon). 

But we assume Rickon is a shaggydog character, primarily because of Chekov's Shaggy Dog.


&gt;Many characters only serve to deepen your understanding of how war affects very different lives, and how people attempt many different survival strategies, and how some of these really don’t work well at all – they won’t become Queen, or help someone else become Queen, they’ll just live their lives in a land savaged by a war for the throne.

But each plays their part in advancing the story. Brienne interacts with a lot of these, and each one has bearing on her story arc. Dick Crab reminds her that she'd better use her damn magic sword, lest she come to regret it. The people running their little child-labor scam at the Crossroads Inn may not be around, but the consequences of their actions created a reason for Gendry to be there. Septon Meribold provides valuable exposition. 

&gt;Her arc there isn’t about her finding Sansa;

True

&gt; it is about the devastating effect war has on the people.

But it's also giving us a thorough sampling of the climate within the Riverlands. It's giving us context to understand the climate for the Sparrow uprising in KL. It may very well be laying the groundwork for what's to come as far as the developing factions within the central area of Westeros. 

It's showing us the effects that the actions of the powerful central characters are having in the commonfolk, to be sure, but that doesn't mean it isn't also advancing the plot.

&gt;The show adaption has cut out entire threads, presumably because they either don’t pan out, or their role can be taken over by someone else. (fAegon is a striking example). And therefore, it can now finish a story that will cover a fair part of TWOW and all of ADOS and get to the end in a mere six episodes. They have swept all but the main players off the board, or didn’t introduce them at all, and all that is left now are the major battles and reveals. And yet, can’t you see how much they have lost that way? 

They missed out on some serious Bolt-On, imo.

&gt;For me, the greatest scenes in the earlier seasons weren’t major battles. They weren’t scenes that got people elsewhere, positioned them to make a difference for the final outcome. It was quiet scenes.

Okay, but here you seem to be supporting my position, and negating your assertion that not everyone is a piece on the chess board. Perhaps it is more apt to say that not everyone is a rook or a bishop.

&gt;If we are just looking for the future King/Queen, dragon rider, Azor Ahai, and look at everyone else as providers of armies/ships or magic/assassin/tactical skills for them, we lose what made this story beautiful.

See, I think that while the show trims the fat, and of course can't provide as richly intricate of a story, it still provides the essence of what I think you are saying here.

There are multiple PTWPs in both show and books. It isn't just that everyone else is a means to an end for Jon, Danny, Tyrion and Jaime. Arya, the Hound, Davos, Sansa, Brienne, Gilly, Samwell - each could be a PTWP in their own right. 

Not everyone gets to be a main player, but the minor characters still have more life than we usually see on the screen, and the ""chosen savior"" figures are less clearly defined... at least, that's where I think it's going. We'll see after S8...

I like this post a lot and you make some very excellent points. My main issue with it is that you say to stop invoking Chekov, whereas I think Chekov's gun is very valid within the text.

You seem to be saying that the show falls short by cutting out characters that provide a more realistic world within the books, by showing how everyone matters and how actions have real consequences to them. I can see that. I don't blame the show for failing where the book excels because that is the nature of the medium. 

What I find interesting is that I have noticed the show actually fucking with Chekov's gun, in a way that I have not seen in the books. Perhaps it is easier to see this in the show because of how they had to streamline events and characters.

My primary example: Locke and Carl Tanner. There seems to be this strong forshadowing that the two will meet and have a badass assassin fight. They completely miss each other, by the tiniest margin.

It seems to add to the feeling of ""life isn't like the songs"", gives a sense that ""nothing is written in stone"", and creates the illusion of randomness. Yet, if Locke had taken out Carl, Jon wouldn't have learned to fight dirty. The Magnar of Thenn would have killed Jon at Castle Black. Yggritte would have killed the Magnar. Olly would have seen the wildling who shot his father killing the scary one who said he was going to eat his parents, and he would have a less black and white view of the wildlings. He would have grown up to lead the Night's Watch and become the PTWP... (just kidding, idk...). 

Anyway, sorry for meandering or if I misunderstood your point. I just wanna say that Chekov's gun is a valid instrument, and GRRM does see everyone on the board as a chess piece. We don't know exactly where this is going, niether does GRRM, but he is just trying to figure out how to maneuver all the pieces to get to something that approximates a conclusion. I hope he does a better job in tying it all together than I did with this comment.

faaaaaaawn,"the point of a league is to add a new mechanic that interacts with the core game and mechanics we already have in the game in a way that is interesting and adds value to the overall experience. which is why the best leagues have been leagues like nemesis, beyond, ambush, etc.

synthesis has potential, but it's too far removed from the ""core"" endgame experience. it feels more like an expansion to the game and a new addition to the endgame. you are right we need to start asking ourselves what the point of a league is. most of our leagues lately have felt more like sacrifice of the vaal... expansions to the game. not simple but interesting mechanics to add to the core experience and modify our playstyles in interesting ways. its creating and pushing players into entirely new endgames, and ones that people aren't always necessarily interested in being pushed towards. you didn't feel punished if you didn't interact with the sacrifice of the vaal stuff. you do feel punished if you don't interact with delve whenever your sulphite randomly fills up in a map, after your 11th incursion, and if synthesis wasn't botched every 10 memory tiles.

i like the idea of alternate endgames. i don't like the idea of people who just enjoy mapping feeling pushed to spend significant portions of their time not mapping but having to go do alternative endgame chores they don't enjoy because they are being pushed heavily by the game to interact with those mechanics every x amount of maps. and part of the reason why they are structured and made this way is because they are designed to be leagues and shoe horned in that way instead of as expansions.",eioq6xb,t3_b1sbzx,/r/pathofexile/comments/b1sbzx/37_should_be_a_simple_abyss_or_breach_like_league/eioq6xb/,1,pathofexile,,,2019-03-16

_Silvre_,"Technically yes, but the amount of echoes you need are trivial, especially so the further you get into the game. If you repair your weapon every time you visit the hunters dream, I bet that it would probably only cost maybe 50 to 100 echoes max.

Weapon upgrading is similar, but only ever so slightly more costly upfront. I don't remember how many shards there are in central yharnam, but let's assume that there are enough to get to a +2 weapon (which requires 8 shards). I believe it should cost &lt;1000 echoes for the two upgrades.

Do keep in mind that the weapons are all different, but more or less equally viable. It's not like there are weapons which are strictly better than some other weapons.

I don't know what specific clips you've seen, but I guess that the long health and stamina bars you see are more so endgame stuff, generally ranging from 35 to 50 health.

Metalicker,"You see, I don't get this. I've been a Warlock main from the start. In D1, we barely had any endgame utility. Hunters had tether/gg, and Titans had bubble/melting point. We just sort of... were. Self res was nifty, but if you were a good player chances are it wouldn't have made much of a difference.

... And I couldn't have been happier. If I were a Titan or Hunter, no doubt I'd have been made to run the same subclasses through every raid encounter. But not being a part of the subclass meta meant that I could be what I wanted. It was fantastic! In raids where the majority of us were Warlocks, and were lacking a Titan or Hunter, we made do. Not having a meta defining ability does not make you useless in the slightest. Otherwise I would have cleared far less raids. 

Now that well of radience is a thing, that's all anybody wants from a raid Warlock. If you're one of only two Warlocks in the raid, it's required.  Which is just... so dull. I love playing support roles, but I like to switch things up. Playing the same subclass _cooonstaantly_ is not fun. The reality is, Tether, GG, WoR, none of them are _required_. But just the fact that they exist and are, well, _good_, means that people rely on them for efficiency's sakes. They _become_ requirements.

I know it's hard to see, but that is the benefit of being the lesser performing class. You get to be what you want, not what everybody else wants you to be. Don't feel bad about it. Those abilities, they're all crutches! You don't need them. If another player feels like they need a tether, or a well, _they_ should run it! My philosophy is, if you feel like you could live without something, then it's not your responsibility to provide it. Keep doing Titan things! And don't let anybody tell you that you're a scrub for being what you choose to be!

RogueActual117,"I know all the casuals will downvote this but respawns will make this game more sweaty. If your team can’t make endgame now and win then you will definitely lose endgame if they implement respawns. All the sweaty teams will be alive late-game every time. Respawns will only benefit sweats. Causal teams will always be completely wiped out against sweats so they won’t even have a chance to respawn. While on the other hand the one sweaty that gets thirsted gets back into the game.

Another issue is that if a team is about to die the best move will always be to rift away to a respawn van. This will make the game super annoying because you will never be able to eliminate teams as they keep running away and respawning. Every fight will be one guy hanging back with supporting fire while their 3 teammates rush in. Whether that team wins or loses the fight means nothing in the long run because they are guaranteed a respawn.

For respawns to even be balanced they would have to have a limit on respawns per team and respawned players would have to start from scratch.",eipgscs,t3_b20abi,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b20abi/respawn_should_not_be_implemented_in_the_game/eipgscs/,1,FortNiteBR,,,2019-03-17

N7610,"I believe back when the game leaked, the leaker said it felt like a $30 experience packaged for $60.

It shows in just how brief everything is in the game. We have large detailed enviornments, but are shoehorned into a linear section of the world by invisible walls. The actual plot of the game unfolds after the 'meat' of the game which really hurts the impact intended for nearly every scene in the endgame. 

Did it work? Yes. Was it done well? Absolutely not. 

If anything, a lot of the game is missing potential. Another poster stated that the things he/she was worried about ended up all right, but what they weren't worried about ended up problematic. This really encapsulates my stance on the game as a whole.

For every hype moment in the disney worlds, it felt like they were cut off to be done later. Rather than Sora losing to Marluxia during battle in tangled, Maluxia simply puts Sora to sleep because of 'magic'. If Nomura wanted to show us Sora was weak, then show us rather than outright telling us ""Sora is weak in this cutscene, in order to drive the plot forward."" It was funny the first time in Olympus, it was a dead horse by the end of the tangled world. If Sora is incredibly weak, then you need to let the player feel he is weak. This doesn't happen at all since most of the actual action occurs in a cutscene.

It's dissonant, and very bizarre in terms of decision-making as to why many choices were made for the development of the game. An engine switch does not stop all aspects of development for the game, especially considering how modular UE4 is in terms of allowing you to import assets, etc. It's as though development on the game stopped for two or three years which gave us the power of waking plot. Then development was revisited and finalized after the switch with just the endgame being tossed onto the end.

Barthas,"I never argued that they aren't solo-able, and I don't think the post I'm defending did either. I don't think anyone is saying that. What is being said is that it is extremely taxing, unfun, requires near-perfect play (very punishing on minor mistakes), or all of the above to do them solo. The rewards locked behind these quests, notably Kulve, are also extremely relevant endgame content, but to do them alone sounds absolutely infuriating. 

I don't have anything against challenge quests. I like many of them. However, there is content locked behind these that forces an average player to find a group to do it with, endure random online players, not do the content, or attempt it by themselves. I'm lucky enough to be able to scrounge up a 4 man group, and seemingly on a whim, but many players can't manage that. MH is a hard game (and series overall) to get into, and I can count the number of people whom I know (and have previously known) who play on my fingers. Online players are unreliable at best, and your average player will not and probably cannot solo something like Behemoth. The game itself nearly screams at you to have a full squad to go fight it at any given opportunity, and Kulve is built around having 16 different players hunt a single monster. 

All I want is for people to be able to play how they want. I usually quite enjoy solo fights, but I can see the appeal of solo. People who want to only play solo and never deal with another human being? They deserve to be able to access all of the content as well, and at a reasonable challenge level. Behemoth and Kulve are not that. My baseline is the average player, since this is unique content availability we're talking about.

zacRupnow,"&gt; the core gameplay that Ember fans enjoy?

Ember has no core gameplay, range nerf killed everything about her. Accelerant still works but isn't and never has been worth choosing to play Ember. There is no Ember gameplay to preserve over a rework for her 3 utterly useless abilities.

&gt; How do you balance... ...for content ranging between lvl 10s and lvl 100s

You fucking don't, balance should always take place at endgame levels for Warframe. The balance of low level up to endgame should only be based on the lack of mods, endo, forma, potatoes, and exilus.

Ember was never a great frame, before they killed her 4 she was just decent with fashion bonus attributing to most of her popularity, she needs a full rework as if she's an entirely new frame and needed it even before she was nerfed to the current abysmal state.

&gt; lvl 10s and lvl 100s

Just coming back to this to say there are several frames that do *% of Enemy EHP* damage so even if you disagree with my point, that balance for low-mid game players should be based on their lack of build resources, that there is a very easy and simple way to balance frames to not mapwipe low levels.",eipig2o,t3_b1x8wg,/r/Warframe/comments/b1x8wg/i_just_watched_the_last_hour_of_pablos_stream/eipig2o/,1,Warframe,,,2019-03-17

Superflaming85,"&gt;Are you still playing BLU?

I want to get back to it, but after hitting cap the only stuff left is skill grinding and I kinda dropped that in favor of leveling crafters and DRG. 

&gt;Are you still enjoying BLU as a limited job?

Yes. I love the genuinely wacky skills they gave BLU, and I have a lot of fun when I get to play around with them...however, the key word here is WHEN. Most BLU skills are a little too much on the balanced end for a class that has some skills that are genuinely overpowered for certain points in the game, and the horrible scaling of the class means that you're either spamming 1000 needles or at endgame. 

&gt;The past two months, have you played BLU more this way than you would have if it was a normal FFXIV Job?

As sad as it is to say, yes. I've played BLU more since launch than I have SAM and RDM since their launch.  

&gt;Should BLU be improved on as a limited job scrapped and made into a real job?

Holy shit, improved. BLU has some really good potential for being really fun to play and having some very fun skills to play around with that no other class would given. And actually getting a chance to explore old zones and pay attention to the monsters in them is fun as well. 

The problem is that right now BLU suffers from an abundance of RNG, and a drought of meaningful content. And no, I'm not talking about the Carnivale here, it's actually pretty great. What I mean is that moveset-wise, BLUs are incredibly boring with too many redundant moves that only exist for the Carnivale. This wouldn't be a problem if you didn't need to run things that weren't the Carnivale for abilities. So instead of BLU feeling fun to play everywhere else and even better in the Carnivale, it feels meh to play everywhere else and only fun in the Carnivale. Too much of BLU feels like you need to unlock the ability to have fun. 

...But at the same time, I don't think it's anywhere near completely unsalvageable. It comes really close to being fun at points and the Carnivale is great. It just really needs more updates, and more new abilities to play with, so we can progress more and get more skills without having to pray for primal drops. I can't wait to play it again
in HW zones and get HW abilities, but until then it's probably just going to sit to the side while I level DRG. 

&gt;Do you still see BLUs out in the open world or in the part finder?

Yes! I saw a BLU in the world the other day, and I did see a party for Glower in the Party Finder. I think people are underestimating the staying power BLU is going to have, especially when it gets further updates.  

&gt;Do you feel as though BLU would not exist unless it was a limited job?

Yes, 100%. Aside from Yoshi P saying it himself, it's clear to me that the dev team put a lot of work and passion into what we got already. It's clear this is what they want to do with the class, and as long as they put in the effort to keep doing it and give us more updates while taking actual feedback into account, I'll be eagerly waiting to see more. I think the biggest thing is going to be what they do for BLU next, and that's going to make or break it for me. 

That being said, I think BLU not being a limited job at this point is a pipe dream, and you'd probably have better luck convincing the dev team to make DRK a DPS. ",eip9pp9,t3_b1z0wa,/r/ffxiv/comments/b1z0wa/two_months_of_blu_discuss/eip9pp9/,1,ffxiv,,,2019-03-17

They need to start reusing assets and engines. Ubisoft can make all these claims about multiple teams but you they are reusing assets to build the games. 

This means less work and everyone has familiarity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am surprised we just don't see several FFXV and KH3 clones from Square. All that work, reskin these games. Focus on one area and expand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think they had difficulty initially transitioning to HD and then the western developers started created a viable workflow that allowed them to be more cinematic and offer great gameplay. SE has been trying to catch up. Then their in house engines just required too much development and then next thing they know, new console.

ImpossibleGuardian,"I think both Captain Marvel and Ant-Man and the Wasp are perfectly good ""plane movies"". If you've got some time to kill and they're there for you to watch, by all means watch them and you'll enjoy them.

I'm not gonna rush and tell all my friends to watch either film though, not in the same way Infinity War, Thor: Ragnarok and even Black Panther to an extent were really *worth* watching. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the film though - I mostly went because I felt like it was obligatory viewing before Endgame, but I actually enjoyed what the film had to offer a lot. It was definitely a more interesting, different origin story compared to Doctor Strange, which felt pretty vanilla and unsurprising besides from its crazy visuals. 

It wasn't perfect, but it did a good job of introducing Carol, and made pretty decent use of its solid cast too. Only person I wanted to see more of was Coulson. ",eip6lz6,t3_ay9785,/r/movies/comments/ay9785/official_discussion_captain_marvel_spoilers/eip6lz6/,1,movies,,,2019-03-17

DefinitelyNotAliens,"I specifically chose to avoid potentially spoiling or feeling over-hyped, though. Watching a part of Captain Marvel won't spoil it. It want to avoid spoilers.

It doesn't matter what is or is not in a trailer. I'm avoiding spoiling the film. I chose to avoid trailers or pre-launch press interviews as much as possible. It's not entirely possible. Seen memes of Iron Man stuck on Titan. Know Jeremy Renner was on-set. I know some things about the film. Seen stills of Ant-Man. I can't avoid it all. I just don't click on them.

If it's at the end of Captain Marvel it's a part of the film- same as any post-credits scene showing parts of future films, like the tesseract or Captain Marvel or Thanos.

I'm avoiding spoilers. That was my entire purpose of not watching trailers or interviews or seeking out fan-theories. If it's a part of a film it's not a spoiler, ergo, I can watch Captain Marvel beginning to end.

It's not what's in the trailers. It's walking into Endgame with nearly what I knew walking out of Infinity War plus whatever I learn from Captain Marvel. It's walking into the theater with my beer and turning off my phone and experiencing it- not wondering when a scene will show up or feeling like it's the greatest thing to ever happen and being all stoked to see x y or z happen and realizing people guessed wrong.

JFairclough,"I think the problem is that Steam is a different service than PC. The normal PC service is interconnected with the PS4 service as well, but Steam is all on its own. Meaning if you want to play your account on the PS4 after buying it off Steam, you just cannot. However, you can share an account between a regular PC download and PS4. Not to mention all your expansion purchases have to be bought on Steam if you bought the game on Steam. There is no Physical CE for Shadowbringers for Steam if I recall correctly.

As for your endgame question, the beauty of FFXIV is that you can do everything in one character. That means you can play tank jobs, healer jobs, and DPS jobs in one character. If you're tired of one role, you can easily change to another role to change things up. In terms of endgame content, you have the Extreme Primals, which are more difficult versions of strong bosses that's tied to either the Main Scenario Quests or Sidequests. There's also the Savage Raid which are your usual very difficult dungeon tiers, although it's streamlined to just include the bosses now. And for masochists, there's the Ultimate content, which comprises currently of Ultimate Coil of Bahamut, and The Weapon's Refrain Ultimate.

Sirhamm2," 

I don’t know how religiously John Bercow reads Coffee House, but I am pleased that he has taken the advice I gave here on Saturday to use his powers to block a third ‘meaningful vote’ on Theresa May’s deal. This afternoon, the Speaker has made a statement to MPs that he intends to use his powers to do just this – on the grounds of a long-standing convention that a motion cannot be brought before the Commons if it is substantially the same as a motion that has already been defeated during the current session of Parliament. In one fell swoop Bercow has undermined what had seemed to be Theresa May’s last, desperate throw of the dice – a third vote on her deal.

I am no fan of John Bercow, whom I wish, in a reversal of convention, had been dragged away from the Speaker’s chair before he had even reached it. But he is right to enforce this convention. In trying repeatedly to get her bill through the Commons, the Prime Minister has descended to one of the very worst practices of the EU: keeping on holding votes until they get the right answer – just as happened when the electorates of Denmark and Ireland rejected EU treaties.

May has consistently opposed the case for a second referendum, on the grounds that the decision to leave the EU has already been made and that therefore it would be an affront to democracy to make people vote again. In January, for example, she said: ‘There has not yet been enough recognition of the way that a second referendum could damage social cohesion by undermining faith in our democracy.’

Yet she doesn’t seem to apply the same logic to Commons’ votes. If her deal was defeated at the third time of asking, there was already talk of a fourth vote. And if the EU grants her an extension, no doubt she would be planning fifth and sixth votes, each of them held after she had dangled a few more electoral bribes before MPs. DUP MPs have apparently been dangled promises of another £1 billion worth of public spending in Northern Ireland. No doubt there will be more honours, too, like the knighthood awarded to John Hayes (who thanked the Prime Minister by voting against he deal regardless). At this rate, May’s deal would eventually go through – but only once Belfast City Hall was glistening with gold leaf and the entire European Research Group had been elevated to the nobility.

If a second referendum would damage faith our democracy, May’s attempt to hold repeat votes until she gets the correct answer is doing it even more harm. At least a second referendum would be asking a different question: what sort of withdrawal deal do you want? May is asking MPs exactly the same question over and over again. Bercow’s statement is already generating outrage, but we can thank him for thwarting the Prime Minister’s futile Brexit endgame. Her deal is dead, and thankfully it has now been buried, too.",eitdopm,t3_b2lidh,/r/ukpolitics/comments/b2lidh/john_bercow_is_right_to_block_a_third_vote_on/eitdopm/,1,ukpolitics,,,2019-03-18

razobak09,"I would add to your excellent list of points here that Titans need better PvE Exotics for super uptime and recharge, on par with things like Skull or Geomags or Phoenix Protocol for Warlocks and Orpheus Rigs or Nighthawk or Shards for Hunters. Currently the only thing that Titans have that even resembles those ones is the Ursa Furiosa. I would say that they need to buff Ursa Furiosa to grant Super Energy based on the amount of damage blocked by Ward of Dawn as well as the standard Banner Shield. There should be an Exotic that grants super energy based on the number of kills you get with Thundercrash (just like Shards, Skull, or Rigs which similarly buff the other single-use supers).  

Also, while we're on Titan exotics....to be honest they're all pretty meh for endgame PvE play IMO. The only decent ones are Skullfort, Synthoceps, and to a lesser extent Heart of Inmost Light and Doomfang Pauldrons. But Titans have nothing like Geomags or Orpheus Rigs, or even something to buff neutral game like Lunafactions or . I would do the following:  

* Buff the Actium War Rig to apply to any automatic weapon, not just Auto Rifles. This would be AR's, SMG's, and LMG's. (I understand that coding would be difficult for random weapons that have the full auto perk). This isn't vanilla D1, nobody is sustaining fire with AR's outside of niche circumstances. But LMG's? Definitely.
* Change the Eternal Warrior entirely, to instead grant you Super energy based on the amount of kills you get with Thundercrash, and grant a brief overshield during and after Thundercrash activation. As it is this exotic is useless and just taking up space, so make it useful a la Skull.
* Buff the Ursa Furiosa to apply also to damage blocked by Ward of Dawn. This would help tremendously in encounters like the Bridge or the pseudo-Oryx fight in Reckoning.
* Buff the Heart of Inmost Light to grant the Empowered buff to nearby allies as well as yourself. That would provide more team utility a la the old Song of Flame perk from D1 Sunsinger.
* Helm of Saint 14 would be okay as-is if the bubble itself had more HP. 
* Crest of Alpha Lupi should grant more HP to the barricade in addition to its existing perks. This would reinforce its identity to create a playstyle that centers around dropping barricades. Also, the extra orb feels like it's just a tacked-on perk but I'm not complaining.
* Buff the ACD/0 Feedback Fences to heal you if you get a melee kill for a short time after the main exotic perk procs. That would increase survivability when surrounded.
* Buff the Peacekeepers to also grant ability energy upon SMG kills. This would reinforce the Robo-cop in-your-face SMG playstyle that I think this Exotic is going for.
* Ashen Wake needs to either increase Fusion Grenade damage or grant an additional Fusion Grenade charge or increase Fusion Grenade recharge rate. Or something.. The perk is laughably weak in terms of usefulness in any situation.


There is a whole other conversation to be had about how most of the Titan subclasses are an exercise in the many different ways to skin the same cat. As it is, 8 out of 9 Titan subclass supers do the same thing: roaming, add-clearing supers, with slight variations. The only ones to even remotely offer anything different are Thundercrash and Ward of Dawn and neither of them are used in serious endgame PvE play. Like you mentioned, Thundercrash needs a damage buff to be on par with top tree Nova Bomb, and likewise Ward needs a serious HP buff and more utility. Perhaps rework the entire top tree Sentinel to revolve around the bubble and give it Weapons of Light to increase its endgame usefulness.

And I never once stated an opinion was wrong, but I did say if they stated the game was a solo game as a potential fact that it was wrong as most all endgame content is party plus.

I get that some people liked the level grinding.  To many players their favorite aspect of the game was leveling up and dinging into new abilities or gear.  I understand that and its a completely valid point and was something i enjoyed at one time myself.  See to me, and I venture to say many of the people playing today, we actually think of FFXI as having two golden periods.  That being 75 and then current day.  Our issues with support for a 75 server would be does it take away from today's game development? Would it be actual classic vanilla or would it incorporate some of the QOL's we have now? Will they ever solve for botting of claimed HNMS's or do something to circumvent ridiculous spawn times and conditions?

Look frankly i'm in my 40's and have 4 kids, a wife, a full time job and I just cant play the old 75 version any longer.

EternitySphere,"I was actually quite surprised to find she was much easier then I had been led to believe.  This is my first playthrough and I have been soloing all bosses.  She took me 5 attempts.

Her fighting style is not very aggressive.  If you are behind a pillar and out of her line of sight, she will lurch around more slowly so take advantage of that to heal up and rebuff weapon or repop the end branches, etc.

When you are in front of her, watch her body, not her hands.  She swings her body as she swings her swords around.  On my 5th attempt it was almost a no-hit fight as I could feel every swing and swipe coming and easily dodged every one.  I'd get 1-2 hits in and quickly refocus on the next incoming swings/swipes.

For reference, she took me 5 attempts, the dragon armor took me 5 attempts, Oceiros took me 1 attempt and Champion Gundyr took me 1 attempt.  The real fight is Twin Princes solo...that took me 19 attempts.  They are very aggressive but I found that the line of sight trick worked on them too.  You have to really take advantage of line of sight on the twins to heal up otherwise if they have sight on you, they are constantly teleporting on top of you midswing.

grandobserver,"The no barrier for expansions is an appealing aspect that might catch my interest down the line. 

I find it rather provoking that game quality (their 'release state' that is) has lowered as technology evolves and companies get bigger budgets. Sure, I get that the games today compared to 10-15-20 years ago are infinitely more complex and thereof more bugs can happen. 

But when the game is just poorly designed, like it's being made by newbies or even the same people, but 15 years ago, I get disappointed and provoked. 

Surely a top tier company, with their resources and all, should be able to design a game that doesn't have a boring/frustrating/tedious endgame, one city that is plain out boring and feels like a complete waste of time (time spent designing, and time spent playing in) etc.

Hoping, truly, this game delivers down the line. I hope I can come back in 6-12-24 months and think *wow*",eit7a0s,t3_b28vsx,/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b28vsx/grandmaster_2_and_3_are_so_boring_and_poorly/eit7a0s/,1,AnthemTheGame,,,2019-03-18
jpmynwa,"I don't disagree with your assessment and the others above you.  At this point I'm just kind of desensitized to this process.  In many book series, the story is very tight and focused for the first book or 2. They need to stand alone, because the balance of the story may never be told.  Then when the author gets to later books in the series, the arc often expands beyond one volume, so that whole books can move the plot without any payoff, while driving toward a larger payoff in a final volume.   I believe this is the case in many multi-volume series.  

Martin's style has been to spend a long time setting the board, then have a bunch of things payoff at once.  That's fine when it's all contained within one volume, or when additional volumes are released quickly.  I feel like books 4-5 are  like the middle of book 1, where the board is being set, but none of the payoff moves have happened yet.  IF we ever get Winds and Dream, we will be able to assess books 4-5 in the light of the payoff.  Right now it feels like having seen Avengers Infinity War, and not knowing if they will even make Avengers Endgame.  My assessment of Infinity War will largely depend on how well Endgame resolves all the moves set up in IW...  Unfortunately in our situation, we don't know if or when twow or ados might come, so we're left to analyse what we have.

Sure, Thor could be the one controlled but that would still work perfectly without Carol in the movie. I just believe that would be the thing they use her for narratively. One of the flaws of Captain Marvel (the movie) is that [SPOILERS] she was unstoppable after ""unlocking"" her full powers, and a missed opportunity of not exploring the use of powers recklessly. They could do that here, for example she could feel guilt for hurting/killing someone after confidently rushing to thanos causing her to get controlled after.

MasterWinston,"I'm sorry but this theory doesn't make sense. She has no previous association with Nova Corp and her being in space is not enough of an association. More importantly, Thanos acquiring the Power stone was a part of Infinity War, not Endgame. Why would they show a part of Infinity War's Story in Endgame? Possibly as part of a time traveling narrative but this is clearly not that. Especially considering how these movies have to be tight with pacing this would be a waste.

We already know Thanos is a badass so that doesn't need to be reestablished. Showing Carol can't take him on solo is important but considering they will inevitably clash there are much better ways to do that. For example, she gets to the compound right after the snap. The Avengers quickly decide to go attack Thanos then they lose and many (including Carol) get killed leading Stark/Ant-Man and the survivors to utilize the Quantum Realm/Time travel/whatever. The first part of this (before them getting killed) is based on the rumored footage.

As much as I think the Black Order (excluding Ebony Maw) was underutilized I'm not sure Endgame is the place to fix that. They really don't seem to have much of a place in Endgame's story. That is a flaw of IW not Endgame. Most importantly, this may give us more of the Black Order but I doubt it would make them better characters (it seems to me this fight parallels Thanos vs Hulk).

CopainChevalier,"There's a lot more to do than Destiny; yeah. Gear is a lot differently handled though. Rather than getting a bunch of loot it's more like any weapon is good and you just mod them freely.

The biggest ""pick your poison"" is Warframe has less raid type content and typically focuses on making endgame content that won't ever go out of date (a commonly run set of bosses to this day are years old and still really useful to new players and vets alike). This sounds nice, but it also means you won't get that big fancy gun to show off.


I've played a good amount of Destiny 2; Warframe typically holds me better, but I will say Warframe has a steeper learning curve.",eiuwieu,t3_asfcn4,/r/Warframe/comments/asfcn4/meta_new_or_returning_player_welcome_back_to/eiuwieu/,1,Warframe,,,2019-03-19
mistersmith_22,"You missed my point. What does “outclassed” even mean? Everyone acts like at any given moment there are only 10 or however many weapons that are even viable, but what ever happened to...wait for it...having fun?

Sunshot is one of the funnest weapons in any game ever made. Explosions, crazy unique styling (what even IS that ammo??), hits hard, etc. Sure you’re dumb to equip it in Reckoning but guess what: it works so perfectly fine in so many activities. And GL still wrecks heads in Crucible and basic PVE, and Sweet Business will always be Sweet Business. 

But even if you *do* wanna worry about damage...unless you’re in endgame-level stuff, like Nightfall, Y2 raids, Reckoning, or GPrime, you’re gonna do plenty damage. 

Don’t get wrapped up in mathematics of DPS and perks and all that. Have some fun. And slapping on Y1 gear - even some Blue gear! - can be tons of fun. Looking at you, Ros Lysis II...

BloodDoomed,"And I know what your asking for because of the video you saw on Youtube. The video thats says 
Major LOSSES ARE COMING IN AVENGERS ENDGAME.
Well Tonylony22. Let me assure you that Thor isnt going to Die.. Nor is Tony.. And here is why. 
1 because I know and already told you who was going to Die! LoL so that should be good enough! But thats you taking some strangers word for it on Redit and there are 1000's of people saying this or that. So its totally  understandable. 
2 Tony doesnt Die.. He is the Flagship of the MCU. He does indeed retire.. And his Contract is up. But they are leaving it open for him so he can do a Cameo here and there. Mainly for like Mentor moments for Spider-Man. He may down the road, swoop in and save the day in like Avengers 6-7 and say something like.Because I retired doesnt mean I miss it and keep an eye on all of you all. Ya know something that would make the Theater go nuts.. 
3 Thor still has 4 more movies on his Contract and has expressed Intrest in signing up for more Movies. Cause Captian Marvel is Signed up for 7 movies and there may be a live intrest between Thor and Captain Marvel. Hence.. "" I LIKE THIS ONE"" 
4. Rumor has it that the lil boy in Iron Man 3 , the one that helps Tony with his panic attackes, and Tony left him with a bunch of computers and tech and upgraded his lab out in the garage. Well he grows up and will Become Iron Lad.. And he needs to find Tony! So Tony may also do a Cameo for that. I dont think Iron Lad will be a stand alone Movie. But since were going into phase 4 and it's dealing with the Cosmic Side .. Time Travel, Different Deminsions and Time Jumps will into play and somewhere along the lines... It prob be in a Captian Marvel Sequel but she may go forward in time and there she will see Iron Lad, Hawkeye's Daughter Kate Bishop becomes Hawkeye , the lil black girl in Captain Marvel is Monica Rambeau who becomes Photon , Pulsar or Spectrum..she has used all 3 names thru time. But you get the jist of it. A futuristic Avengers Team.. Tony may do a Cameo..

then that leaves me with 3760 crystals which means i need to either get 2 1750 unis or 3 1250 unis and i can’t decide what would be best for me. i’m leaning towards sharog dark star uni for one and that means i will need to get another 1750 uni but i have no idea which one since capt marvel might be getting a new uni in endgame too.

Antyreal,"1) Best race for siege: Human/Sylph. Best race for plunder:Lich. Best race for early void: Rakan/dwarf. Best race for duel: rakan/lich...
2) For attacking castles 4 sets of sword, 2 set of archers, 3 siege weapon should be fine. 3) Defense depends on the one who is attacking and does not really matter against strong heroes unless you have max research.
4) look for a dragon with purple abilities that buff your troops and human predation or warsong.
4 (second one) you can attack with only heroes and bronze troops to only loose basic resources. That costs a lot of red pots and takes a while but saves silver and gold troops and rare resources. Else they are only useful for power event or lich farming in endgame.

Don’t apologize for asking questions.

I just unlocked WT4 last night after 70 Hrs played. As much as I was excited to start thinking about potential builds, all of it is invalidated by the fact that when WT5 comes out all the items I have will be useless?

So all I can do till then is hit the cap and wait.

I have no interest in exploring the map for muhhhh ""lore"" and obtaining pointless collectibles.

I just want to start minmaxing and making builds. Which Isn't efficient to do until WT5 comes out

No - I don't see that. But just in case, I'll expand on it.

The movie industry, for all it's recent wokeness, is about making money. As much money as they can possibly squeeze out of any given property.

Even if this Author could convince every transtrender in the US, and their allies, not to see the movie it wouldn't be noticeable in the box office.

As to my personal involvement in CM ... I saw the trailer, wasn't interested, and didn't see the movie. I'm also not going to see Endgame, because I'm not interested in that. Didn't see Infinity War either.

biigm,"I've got very familiar impressions to you, almost identical. From one side I'm almost sure he will live, but there is this small feeling he could not survive the Endgame.  


I've got the same feeling when I were wondering about guardians future without James Gunn - if this movie would be made by other director with possibly rewritten/tweaked script, I could probably be fine with killing him in endgame witch could be an amazing and emotional end of his story arc.

But now I don't think disney ever took into consideration not making Gotg vol.3 or even altering it - so I don't think James Gunn fiasco had any influence on the A4 script. I can't imagine next guardians movie without Rocket, it simply won't work like it should. James Gunn said that third movie will be the last installment of the guardians in their actual form - and I keep hopes to see one more time full teamup (even with Gamora). We know we are going to know Rocket origin story - and I don't think all of it will be included in A4. Rocket is also James Gunn favourite guardian and we even heard rumours that gotg. 3 could be centered arround him.  


Nethertheless Rocket sacrificing himself for his best friends could be very fitting - we know in these situations he can be reckless and very impulsive. He will blame himself for the death of his family and will search for some kind of redemption, doing possibly everything he can to save/avenge them - this is his turning point.

Half the reason I still boot up GW2 is to make my characters look good. I run around for 30 minutes, then just quit the game.

One of the biggest problems I have with WoW is how limited their transmog system is. It's the reason I love FFXIV and ESO. I can make myself look how I want. If I want to look pretty I can look pretty. If I want to look badass I can make myself look bad ass.

lightsaber5500,"Its pretty good though, but if you were to move on to endgame, I would mostly focus on the Ruby Mine because its income is very high since they added the very big Ruby Mine research node that starts out on 100%.

You would probably be doing a lot of research for the Ruby Mine since later the research points would be slow to acquire. Also focus on the other small Ruby nodes since the big one approximately costs the same amount of research points for the two small research nodes (if to fully max out) since these nodes give a bigger boost first than the big node.

Hong-Zhi,"I think his inclusion in FE7 is... unwarranted I guess? Maybe just poorly executed.

In FE6, he was this super secret endgame character with insane growths. Sure he could only get one level up from these growths, but that doesn't change the fact at how awesome it is to get a guaranteed perfect level-up and then some. He really does feel like some super-badass swordsman whose seen his fair share of battle. Plus being a Swordmaster, the best pure-combat class in the game with its 30% crit rate, only adds to his coolness.

And then, in FE7... Sure he's illusive and hard to recruit, but he sucks. The Swordmaster class was nerfed hard, his bases are mediocre at best, and his growth rates, while pretty good for a pre-promote, come nowhere close to the awe inspiring 210% HP growth he had in FE6. He doesn't feel like an unstoppable Sword Demon, he feels like fresh-squeezed bench juice.

I get that showcasing his character during his Sword Demon days really adds weight to how he describes himself in FE6, but the fact that he's such a subpar unit (and the fact that he competes with the far superior Harken as they are FE7's Arran and Samson) makes his inclusion feel super underwhelming.",eiugohq,t3_b2pcn1,/r/fireemblem/comments/b2pcn1/elibe_discussion_thread_karel_saint_of_swords/eiugohq/,1,fireemblem,,,2019-03-19

Simiris,"Korwa has a long rampup time and for endgame grids she has limited usability due to dmg cap and no dmg on CA. If this it is a long fight, you can keep her buffs running and dmg cap isn't concern, she is amazing(but it's alot of if's...).

Selfira is more of a healer/defensive char due to her healing on CA, fast ca generation and self cleanse for stuff like gilgamesh. She is a very good choice for harder content and soloing, but i wouldn't use her for racing.

As for S Yuel, haven't tested her myself, but her kit seems very strong with a reasonably high amount of dmg and heal+cleanse on top. I would definetly use her over most other wind chars.

As for teamcomp:

Sieg+Yuel+ G Lecia for most content, this will allow you to get 5 attack stacks for lecia buff, and have both high dmg and reasonably high survivability. This is also extremely suitable for an ultima sword teamcomp. Using lennah or Selfira if needed for defense(best choice will vary depending on fight, as will who to exchange for). If you find content where korwa is actually suitable, she can do alot...

As for mc choices, if you go for atma sword, Glory with Ridill/Ultima/Windhose/grimnir katana,  zerker with ultima/windhose or CR with gw dagger/LE(reunion seems unsuitable due to lack of MA).

cardslash02,"If you want to help Endgame break records, see it once opening weekend, then wait a week or two and see it again. 

Superhero films are notoriously front-loaded, meaning everyone goes to see them on the opening weekend and then they quickly lose steam. 

Endgame is tracking to have the biggest opening weekend of all time. It doesn't need help to break that record. However, over the next few weeks it will have to fight off newcomers like Detective Pikachu, John Wick, and Aladdin. These are expected to be heavy hitters and will draw money away from Endgame. Last year, Infinity War faced little competition in its first three weeks, but this year it will face a lot more. It could affect the overall box office of Endgame. 

It's unlikely that Endgame surpasses Infinity War by all that much, because there's not a ton of new people who have suddenly become Marvel fans in the past year who didn't go see Infinity War. In addition, if Endgame is truly 3 hours long it may cut down on the overall number of showings (you can only fit so many showings in a day) which could slow the box office earnings down. 

Basically it's no sure thing that Endgame will break even with Infinity War, much less surpass it. If you truly want to make sure it does, wait till the end of May and go see it a few more times to give it that box office longevity against competitors.

GentleDementia,"1.) You can re-roll mods.  However, the likelihood of re-rolling a mod into a grade 10 is approximately the same odds of a grade 10 mod dropping on it's own.  So it definitely takes a significant investment in terms of time and gold/re-roll tokens.  (Re-roll tokens drop from the Drakenfrost Resort and Drakenfrost Keep maps, btw).  
  
2.) If you're talking about Onslaught, yeah gear score doesn't affect it.  You just get to higher floors by beating the previous floors.  The earlier floors do correspond to different chaos gear levels, but past about 24 or 25 it's all chaos 7 gear, and enemies just keep scaling infinitely.  
  
3.) When you beat your highest-beaten-so-far Onslaught floor, you do get (or at least have a chance to get, I'm not sure if it's random or only every other floor or something like that) a Defender pack, with cosmetics in it.  But you can't keep grinding the same floor over and over, it's gotta be your 'highest' floor.  
  
4.) I'm not far enough to say for this one sorry, I only ever found one Chaos 8 ampoule, and I used it on a relic.  Be warned that upgrading chaos 8 gear is expensive as shit (1.25 million gold, 125 motes, and 50 upgrade material **per level**.  However, there are only 5 levels for chaos 8, instead of the 10 for chaos 1-7)  
  
5. You don't lose your gear when you do an 'Ancient Power Reset', but any gear you have collected will be downgraded to the weakest gear level.  So if you have a great piece of equipment, with grade 10 mods or whatever, you won't lose it.  but you will have to pay to upgrade it again.  
  
Ancient Power Resets are a whole thing to talk about, but the basics of it are Don't Reset at 30 (resetting too early makes it take way longer to get back up to where you were) and Don't Reset Just Once (each reset only gives you a small bonus, and they only really become worthwhile if you stack up a bunch of bonuses.  So don't reset unless you're planning to do it at least 5-10 times minimum).  
  
There's lots of guides and forum posts out there about resetting, since it's one of the main endgame activities.",eiuexxn,t3_b2qke5,/r/dungeondefenders/comments/b2qke5/returning_dd2_player_i_has_questions/eiuexxn/,1,dungeondefenders,,,2019-03-19

As much as I hate the evil mirror protagonist trope, Carol needs to have someone who is either more powerful than her or who can depower her. It's the superman problem. How do you solve the superman problem? The russos made vision sit out half of CW and they impaled him at the start of infinity war.

You **can** do this without the Annual Pass, albeit with WAY more grinding. I bought it for access to Gambit prime, the armor from Gambit prime, Black Forge, and most of all, POWER SURGE BOUNTIES. Power surge give you all blues at 640, making you jump ahead to where you need to be for the Scourge Raid. The grind will still be there, since getting to 700 is no joke, although I do mostly play solo. All in all, if you want access to end game content, and want to be able to compete in Gambit and have a chance, the Annual Pass is required.

They could've bought themselves more time if WT1--&gt;4 were paced properly, but it's clearly not, part of me wonders why they even used the World-Tier system at all - it's essentially just leveling. When I was leveling I would still often use the same weapon \~2 hours on average, in the World-Tier endgame I was tossing a weapon every 45 minutes... you start to realize that the time you even spend thinking about making your build efficient is not worth it.

GSEBVet,"I would argue it is pay to win, unless you have way more free time than your average player.  All of the Korean MMOs are this way.  Did you play Tera?   It reminded me a lot of the end game weapon upgrade paths/grinds.

That being said, it’s one of the best looking and fun MMOS I’ve played in a very long time.   The player driven economy and depth to life skills tying into the economy is incredibly deep.   The character models are incredibly good for a MMO.   The art style and design of the game is very nice on the eyes.

The game does have a big learning curve, and it seems like I’m learning more and more each day.   I’m only level 45 but it’s been a blast so far.   

But all of the videos I’ve watched for this game from high end PC players who moved over, this is a pay to win game at endgame.   

That and realize it’s basically a PVP game at endgame.    There’s no PVE instanced dungeons or raids.   I really wish it had the later, then this would be one of the absolute best MMOs out there.

So far I’ve just spent the $9.99 on the game, but absolutely can see the importance/if not necessity of the cosmetic payed armor with extra stats, pets, and other boosts.  Probably not required for casual play, but if you want to be competitive high end/save time you’re going to have to pay real money.

poolback,"The thing is that WT5 is going to give access to actual Gear Sets, Exotics and weekly invaded missions. Right now in WT4, no missions are being invaded again, and the gear sets  don't exist yet, as well as exotics, so people are only farming a limited subset of endgame content.  


Basically, the endgame feels quite incomplete. So for the people who are at that point, it makes sense for them to be asking for WT5 as it will definitely make it feel more complete. There's also the feeling that the time you invest in finding loot now will be wasted as soon as WT5 drops.

&amp;#x200B;

So I completely understand this feeling. I am not yet there, only in WT2 so far, but I completely understand why people in WT4 are eagerly waiting for WT5.  


Right now, it's not just the people who ""rushed"" the game who are WT4. People who played ""casually"" but for a long period of time since it came out are also at that point.

phantom13927,"It's important to note here (Indie game dev here) that there is no such thing as true RNG when it comes to computer programming. There's pseudo-RNG, but the underlying basis is that any numerical generation involves some form of a ""seed"", which is then fed into a function which generates a string of numbers based on the seed.

To accomplish a sense of randomness, usually something consistently changing such as clock time or CPU time is incorporated into the seed algorithm to obtain the string, but this isn't random, it's a fixed list based on a changing seed. 

This then begs another question, how exactly do you properly encode ""bad-luck protection""? If you're considering ""why not weigh all strikes evenly"", the system will degrade to a point in which all strikes are centered on the mean, which is another way of saying what's the difference between random strike selection and a hardcoded list on a rotation. The same issue is affecting other parts of the game (Ada-1 selection, endgame drops, etc).

I recall when working on modifications for a game called Tribes 2 (Torque Game Engine) that the underlying random number generator was subject to two flaws (Repeating values and non-appearing values) that were completely dependent on the selected seed of the generator and the selected range of values. I suspect that one or both of these may be at play here, but this opens a complete secondary conversation on what algorithm is being used, and how can it be tuned, updated, or replaced for different systems.

Nice work, I'm curious to see what others think of this.",eiztpbk,t3_b3htcf,/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/b3htcf/i_wrote_a_simple_computer_program_to_test_the/eiztpbk/,1,DestinyTheGame,,,2019-03-20

She's gone against everything Beth warned in the beginning and she's shown that she's someone that can show up for you, but also not take any of your shit. She loves that Pearson charm, but she's not so wrapped up in it that she'll forget who she is. I really love them together and hope they're endgame. 

I don't think Kevin truly wants kids. He said it himself that he feels like it's just something people do. Also, if this doesn't work out because of the kid thing he can only blame himself. She told him to take enough time to think about it and he didn't.",eizryax,t3_b3eqyw,/r/thisisus/comments/b3eqyw/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_kevin_and_zoe/eizryax/,1,thisisus,,,2019-03-20

RealityMachina,"To add on to the great popcorn drama revealed by The Outer Worlds, apparently the Division 2 just had a devstream mentioning that the endgame endgame content (World Tier 5 + the raid) is not coming this week, and from the sounds of it it sounds like it may not be coming this month at all.

This of course made a lot of people angry about how they're disappointed, feel duped, and otherwise mad about how the game they bought didn't feel like it focused on endgame as much as they said it did.

I feel bad for Massive because a good chunk of this is coming from people who just overhyped stuff of their own accord without any real basing in the marketing material, just from ""see Anthem bad and this game good"", but man

It is fucking hilarious knowing so many people on here called what was going happen.

xXAlwaysDownVoteMeXx,"i would be happy with any meaningful grind other than gear that will help me gear up once wt5 comes out, what you seem to not understand is that you consider wt4 endgame while i see the game was released without its real end and we are just waiting for them to do more testing on the game they released, so no i dont want to be the best i just want to be able to grind towards being stronger. Do i think new characters in a fighting game should be banned from tournaments because it will shake up the tier list? NO, so fuck off with the be the best shit i just think that if they are going to release the game they should have the definitive end game and then additives in after, new classes cool thats something you can spend time leveling up. my problem with the division 1 was there was no end game until they released dlc, destiny 1 you would play the same strikes over and over again hoping an exotic would drop, destiny 2 again after the story was done there was pvp and strikes until ""further dlc"" i thought the division 2 would have had a definitive world not a timed expansive one so my mistake. you really think the time period from when the game is released to ""not this week but soon"" is a proper hike in max level to consider it an expansion then you are in a really fucked up mmorpg timeline if you think every 2 weeks the level cap should be increased and all of your gear score should have to grind up higher again. no lets make this happen every 2 weeks a new world tier comes out and if you dont keep up with the grind of doing the 2 mission and a stronghold tbh i wouldnt mind the grind ",eiz3hge,t3_b3apzc,/r/thedivision/comments/b3apzc/the_difficulty_of_the_game_is_not_perfect_posts/eiz3hge/,1,thedivision,,,2019-03-20
