I still don't like the look of Cyborg but i do think i will like him in this. Aquaman is the true standout in this trailer though and it makes me even more excited for his standalone film.

DoctorCroooow,"Okay, I'm here to help.  Disclaimer: I am a huge Batman fan.  As a kid from the comics before *Batman '89* but well after *Batman '66* so I know what I'm talking about with these characters, at least the main ones.  Not claiming to be an expert, just that I am very familiar with how wrong *all* the movies get these characters, even Nolan's movies while excellent films, aren't ""really Batman"":

&gt; These portrayals of their characters just don't work.

You are 100% on point.  They don't work.  Some people who are big fans of Superman, Batman, etc. are so excited to see them together that they don't care.  Zack Snyder has basically said he doesn't *read* comics, but he does enjoy the art.  That is very clear. 

&gt; Hell, I enjoyed Superman Returns more than the latest batch, since he was portrayed as cheesy, a hopeful relic of a time past.

It was closer to Superman than *Man of Steel* ever got.  Superman is supposed to be cheesy and hopeful.  Superman is not supposed to be Batman.  Zack Snyder made Superman into Batman and Batman into the Punisher.

&gt; Bad wooden dialog, prequel-trilogy-quality green screen settings, laughable setpieces.

Unfortunately, the dialog I am expecting at this point, but the green screens look horrible.  It's 2017 and Zack Snyder is supposed to be good at making his movies look good.  There is no excuse.

&gt; They're even excited about the absence of Superman from the trailer, as if they've all got secret insight as to whether or not he'll be in the film. SPOILER Of course he will, dummies.

I don't understand why people think Superman isn't in this (on some level, they already hinted at his return at the end of *BvS* and put him on some of the [promotional material for *Justice League*](http://www.lehren.com/sites/default/files/145345.jpg)).  Plus Lois Lane is in the trailer.  Why would she be in the movie if Clark/Superman is not?

&gt; Does anyone really get that pumped up for the Bat and the Furious ""stunt"" starring Karl Doggo and the Batmobile?

That looks silly, but I am glad they are showcasing how useful Aquaman is in a fight.  Superfriends did not help his image with him riding a seahorse and talking to fish, there is a lot more to that character.  Casting Jason Momoa is probably the best thing going for that character, even if he looks nothing like Arthur Curry.

&gt; J. Jonah Jameson as Commandant Zordon is in the trailer to deliver a single line, cloaked in shadow, barely recognizable, and there's people **singing his praises of how he's a perfect fit for the movie**

Me personally, I think he's a great actor and can bring something to the role.  There is not enough in this trailer for me to say that I know this will happen.",dfefuze,t3_61gn4l,,50,RedLetterMedia,,,2017-03-25

I'd say Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the next best contender. It already has an overwhelming amount of fan support and if it can build off of what the original did and maybe even surpass it, then it'll have everyone piling to see it.

Klesk_vs_Xaero,"Of course, with the rise of the fascist movement, came the rise of the fascist violence, which was naturally going to provoke reactions – even strong ones – especially by the socialists, who were the primary targets of the fascist. Giacomo Matteotti – a Socialist leader and famously murdered by fascists in June 1924 – spoke in the Chamber on January 27th 1921:

*It has been said, by Honorable PdC Giolitti, that here we speak against the motion of the parliamentary right, because every party wants to have the government doing its bidding. Honorable Giolitti misses the mark entirely. … Now it is not about those parliamentary maneuvers that Honorable Giolitti masters so skillfully. It is about clearing the reciprocal position where he, as representative of the government on one side, and the representatives of the ruling classes on the other, stand …
But let's see first the facts. …*

*It looks like the press is enjoying this dreadful child play, to blame each other for being the first, the provoker... *

*When last Sunday in Ferrara, actions by armed fascists gave this result: four league members wounded, two badly, two league buildings burned down, twenty socialists under arrest, no wounded fascists, no fascists under arrest; the newspapers title: “New assaults and new violence of Ferrara socialists in the country”. That's how truth is told!
But when on the other hand, and sadly so, a fascist is killed … then, two hours later everybody knows that the Socialists did it! It is known it was a socialist plot, arranged by the Work Chamber. … Therefore after a few hours, the Work Chamber is assaulted, the PSI representatives are assaulted...*

*I admit openly that every party, every mass, harbors some delinquents... But the issue goes further the mere episodes... : today in Italy there is a public organization, known in its members and leaders, composition, buildings and locations, which is made up of armed brigades, that openly declare (they are brave so, and I give them that) that they mean to exert acts of violence, retaliation, to threaten and execute their threats, as soon as something happens or is claimed to have happened, that could be blamed on the workers' movement … It is a perfected organization carrying on private justice.*

*I'd like to be answered ... that this is not true. But even your papers say it is. Yet we are provoking! Isn't it true that in the cities of Modena, Ferrara, Bologna, streets are run by armed groups, dressed in uniforms, led as a militia, often with weapons in sight, saying or claiming to restore an order of their own – disregarding the order of the government, of the [state] authority?*

*The reasons of fascism, according to your papers, are to be looked for into the dictatorship of the proletariat that was established in the country land... [I admit] every excess and misstep; but in a civil society it must be attempted to get rid of those with the right measures, through education of the proletarians. Agrarian forces don't! Agrarian forces organize violence, stir violence, the most open violence, because it is made up of the most backwards part of the bourgeois, the one that, to save its wallet, would rather let the State die, because it cares for nothing but its profit, its immediate gain.*

*Our democratic State proclaimed the right, within its laws, its constitutional structure, of the working classes to move forward. This is said but it seems to be no longer true. Because … the Agrarian denies it; and I quote here the exact words of the Giornale d'Italia: “The establishment is still stuck in the old archaic belief, based on ideology and humanitarianism, that grants the workers the right of assembly and strike”.* 

*The Government claims to be something outside, above the classes … But we claim that the Government of Honorable Giolitti and Honorable Corradini is complicit in all these acts of violence^4 . … No, Honorable Giolitti, in this moment parliamentary skill is useless. This game of yours … does not help.
It's far simpler. We demand nothing! … We ask for nothing. 
We only want to know from you exactly, since you claim to be the representative of the law above equal for everyone … if you truly are, if you can be. And we show with facts that you are not and that you can't be.*

*When an act of violence is committed by the “red” workers, repression is forthcoming... But when it is the case of an organization which openly advocates armed association and militias, preaching private justice, posting death notes for this and that one … your authority is nowhere to be found.*


&amp;nbsp;



Matteotti wasn't wrong. Let's see what the Ferrara prefect G. Pugliese wrote on March 12th 1921.


*Ferrara's Fascio di Combattimento had since its inception a political end: fight against any devaluation of the war and the victory. In its development, the original manifesto changed content and focus, moving from the original conservation of a moral set of values, to offensive action, in order to free the workers' mass from any desired ideological servitude. Therefore their aggressive method of fight; armed strikes in the neighboring localities, where requested [by the locals] or where the red organizations were supposed to have a stronger grip.*


Here Pugliese goes on blaming the socialists for everything; what's more disturbing is perhaps the fact that he truly mirrors the dramatic portrait drawn by Matteotti.


In fact, closer to the election day, Pugliese was forced to acknowledge the result of these actions; on May 8th 1921 he wrote to the ministry: *Last night 20 persons, having surrounded the house of Gaiba Natale … took and brought on the street Gaiba himself, a notorious subversive, who, having attempted to escape, was hit by a gunshot, and left dead. Public Security … identified and apprehended the murderer as Morandi Umberto and nine more and took custody of their guns*

As far as her role in Justice League is, at most I hope she is brought on by Bruce to investigate the scientist disappearances (maybe a few minutes more screen time than Jena Malone in Batman v Superman, which is actually the character they could use to link Lois' involvement in the scientists since she knew her) and there to see Superman return/a reunion scene for them.

Batman v Superman was released on this very day and it holds a very special place in my heart. I understand some people hate it but i love it dearly! From the themes, to the score, to the performances to the amazing visuals. BvS will always be one of the most important comic book movies in my heart! I think Zack Snyder did an amazing job grounding his characters, making them relatable and how he deconstructed them.

Man of Steel was the birth of a god

I can kind of get games console fanboyism. They're super expensive and people want the one they invested in to be the best. And they want other guys to suck so they don't feel bad about not being able to afford it.

But if Marvel AND DC are making really good films, we can all watch them all and enjoy them all. Why would someone want a movie to be shitty, it doesn't benefit them at all. Amazing movies benefit everyone and should hurt nobody. Unless they start releasing Avengers and Justice League shit on the same weekend or something dumb.",dfefgax,t3_61fwt8,,15,movies,,,2017-03-25
opticon,"Lot of people are getting excited about this. I'm not seeing anything that makes me think it will be any better than the other trainwrecks launched by WB. So yeah we can get into it, but let me address this directly to WB.

First thing that comes to mind is the music used for the trailer. Let's pick something spot on, like right on the fucking nose, Come Together is the most literal song you could possibly pick for the trailer to Justice League- and the style of the song completely mismatches the footage, the style of the franchise, and desperately tries to capture something the movie will probably not be, which is fun. And didn't that work out so well for Suicide Squad? These dumbasses at WB have no idea what they want.

The CG is **janky as fuck** and Cyborg is quite hilariously a face floating on a cartoon body. You're proud of this, WB? You wanna lead with this? Fix it before November, if you have any self-respect left.

They managed to release a trailer that doesn't completely blow the plot in two and half minutes. Congratulations, but the best part is that the footage you did use hints that this movie is going to be so disjointed and unfocused that I fully expect the whole thing to be another three-movies-jammed-into-one clusterfuck of a film. What kind of movie is this anyway? I don't get any single vibe from this at all. *At all*. This is what happens when you try to Avengers before you Phase 1. If you can't communicate your vision to us with a trailer, I'm going to doubt whether you even have one.

You forgot to use Orange. The overused color filter scheme is supposed to be Orange and Cyan. You got the Cyan part down but you forgot to counter that with the bright complementary that makes the visuals pop. So either get your Orange on or color balance the fucking thing correctly. Every movie in this franchise is Pitch Black except it's supposed to take place on fucking Earth not an alien planet with a bizarre solar system. Making a ""darker, more serious"" superhero franchise does not mean *literally darken the visuals*.

Ben Affleck looks awesome as Batman and yeah you don't deserve him.",dfeq3pd,t3_61gn4l,,15,RedLetterMedia,,,2017-03-25

Obazilla,"They didn't really give much reason for batman killing in the theatrical cut, but the extended version sort of gives an explanation, even though as a huge batman fan it isn't good enough for me. Don't read any further than this if you don't want spoilers about BvS. So in the extended cut, there is a scene where Clark Kent goes to Gotham to do some investigating on batman. A homeless person confronts Clark and says something along the lines of batman being angry and dangerous, and we're lead to believe that batman has lost his way. He's angry, brutal, and full of rage. He's been fighting crime for a very long time at this point, and for all of his work, Gotham is still a mess. We can assume by this point that he's probably fought some of the same criminals multiple times, but they keep getting out of jail or prison and getting put back on the streets for him to deal with again. This is one of the reasons that led to the two heroes fighting, batman wasn't just scaring criminals anymore, even good people were afraid of him, and Clark, the boyscout that he is, couldn't stand for that. 

Hopefully in justice league and the future movies, batman will have reverted to his old ways and become one of the good guys again, rather than someone who walks the line of being bad. Personally I would love to see them age him down in future movies and show us what led to him becoming so brutal, maybe there was a death in the family that led to him forsaking his creed to not kill? Hopefully we'll get to see it for ourselves in the near future.  ",dfe5rcj,t3_61futu,,14,DCcomics,,,2017-03-25

My_Big_Fat_Titties,"Have you seen Watchmen? It for my money is the best superhero film ever made and does exactly what you described at the beginning. It's a hard R tale that challenges many preconceived notions about heroes and the nature of good and evil. It features evolving characters and examines the realistic and logical motivations of all involved (including the villain). It defies expectations and yields something larger than itself. Something that changes you and keeps you thinking as you leave the theater. Would you have done the same as the characters you've been rooting for? It proposes moral quandaries and dares to make the audience think about what they believe is right. (Not to mention the stellar performances, stylistic choices, score, direction and writing)

 The thing is movies like BvS are trying to be great and failing, whereas Marvel has reliably and successfully made films that are just good. They're fun flicks that aren't meant to be taken beyond the theater. While Marvel can be counted on to make good movies, they will never be able to ascend to the plateau of great because they limit themselves by adhering to the guidelines and conventions you went on to describe. 

Facts are facts, BvS was pretty meh, and if I were a betting man I'd say Justice League probably will be too. Though to just say that's ""how superhero movies should be made"" isnt quite right either. The genre can become so much more if in capable hands and respected. 

I'd also HEAVILY recommend viewing Watchmen if you're a fan of superhero movies and haven't already viewed it.",dfepgfm,t3_61hhht,,11,funny,,,2017-03-25

TheJoshider10,"Prior to Batman v Superman i'd say 1 billion would have been the minimum for Justice League, as it was for the former pre-release. I think there's still a bit of caution for the movie and Rotten Tomatoes will have a major impact on it. I'd say for it to get to a billion the tone would have to be well received (more in tone to what the MCU has done) and it may or may not be important that the film gets a fresh rating. I think as long as it doesn't critically tank e.g. Batman v Superman and gets something quite polarizing like Man of Steel, it'll reach a billion. 

Ideally the movie gets critical acclaim as well as coming off of acclaim from Wonder Woman, so the movie could then be in contention for Avengers level success. After last year I think Wonder Woman has to be at least liked and not completely torn apart like the two movies before it and that could do well for Justice League.",dfe7rzs,t3_61g100,,10,boxoffice,,,2017-03-25

thehypotheticalnerd,"As someone who has so much more experience with DC than Marvel, aside from Spider-Man, as a child... I *wish* I was excited to finally see the Justice League on the big screen. This honestly looks like every single problem I have with the DCEU distilled into one film. It looks like the Chitauri invasion redux albeit likely with a far less personable villain like Loki ushering it along.

It's no secret that I dislike the DCEU. I hate what they did with Superman, with Batman, and Suicide Squad is..yeesh. I hope Wonder Woman is good. It looks good based on the trailers (others like to point out that the trailers for all the films were good but I disliked those too -- after MoS, I realized the subsequent films' trailers looked like more of the same stuff I hated and sure enough...). So fingers crossed WW bucks the trend.

The MCU has its flaws: a lack of good villains outside a handful is a big issue. But overall, as a whole, their approach is far more appealing. For me, this isn't even about being a fanboy war because if it came down to it, I'd be labeled a DC fanboy far before a Marvel one. It's about quality. I adore both DC and Marvel. One of my favorite things ever was when the two publishers came together in the late 90s to do DC vs Marvel/Marvel vs DC and then Amalgam Comics: Superman + Captain America = Super-Soldier, Batman + Wolverine = Dark Claw, Dr. Strange + Dr. Fate = Dr. Strangefate. It's silly, it's over the top, it doesn't *really* make a goddamn lick of sense, and it could have even been a lot better IMO but golly, I love that they did it. I wish we could see an ""All New, All Different Rebirth Amalgam Comics.""

But the DCEU, honestly? This trailer didn't get me excited to watch the movie. It made me want to rewatch JL and JLU to see these character handled correctly. And that stinks because I so desperately want to see the Justice League on the big screen.",dff7cgj,t3_61jhyu,,23,Marvel,,,2017-03-26

blakxzep,"Mostly the direction.  Conroy and Hamill were still great but the chemistry felt wooden like you said due to the direction and poor animation and desire to keep the same dialogue.

And exactly, I have always said this but Azarello is an awful batman writer and this is another one his bad works.  Timm's only fault was for not being more hands on, too respetive of the original source and letting others make decisions and he was probably giddy that someone else liked batbarb.

Justice League Gods and Monsters which was more Timm involved felt great and fresh.  This seems like hes in full control so im excited.  Possible dini could be involved as he is writing backups for Harley and it is the batman tas/harley 25th anniversary which means we better get mask of the phantasm as well",dff5jnw,t3_61ijjf,,10,comicbooks,,,2017-03-26

Rumors are that Ben will drop out before *The Batman* starts filming.  He recently went into rehab for alcoholism and the solo Batman movie will be delayed (they say it's not related)

I think Ben is just waiting for *Justice League* to come out before officially dropping out.  He is a professional.  He filmed that movie and knows dropping out of *The Batman* is not good for *Justice League*.

In my headcanon, both Wayne + Queen help to finance the HQ (apparently, a few stories have Queen Ent. as an initial secret financier of the JL). At this point, maybe Oliver is Green Arrow for fun, and helps to finance the JL because he thinks it's something nice to do. But when he finds out that Bruce Wayne is Batman, a mere man like him and what mere men like him were capable of, that's when he embraces a higher calling for heroism and 1) takes it seriously and 2) later on joins the Justice League.",dfetelv,t3_61i9cd,,8,DCcomics,,,2017-03-26

emeraldknight5,"Full Interview if anyone is interested. People in this thread have taken his quote completely out of context because as usual r/movies does not like to read the article linked.

**On JL heroes** The thing that’s awesome about these icons is that a lot of them we haven’t seen in the movies before on the big screen

**On JL cast** It’s kinda fun to really let (the actors) stretch their legs and inhabit those characters. It is a process to make a team out of this group of individuals, but for the greater good maybe they can put their differences aside.

**On Batman** He’s been a loner for certainly his crime-fighting career, maybe with the exception of Robin. When we meet him in BvS, he’s definitely at this low point of isolation. That was always our intention, that Justice League would be this continuation for Batman to evolve into a more complete hero.



**On WW film** That will flesh out and realize (her island home) Themyscira and embrace canon with her and get all the elements to mash up that I love from original canon. But also we’ll see that dovetail into not only the why of BvS, but even now the why of Justice League and who she is finally realized. We know now where she comes from.

**On JL** They’re each such awesome personalities in the movie You have Jason stomping around as this inked hairy man, just this mythic figure. And you’ve got Ezra, who’s full of life and hilarious and all over the place and amazing — a really fun and also poignant Flash. **And Ray’s story is in a lot of the ways the heart of the movie..** 

**On Superman** It’s hard to have a Justice League without Superman. That’s how I feel about it, Snyder says with a laugh.

It was always a super-intriguing concept to me to have this opportunity to have him make that sacrifice but also have him be this, in a weird sort of way, the why of Justice League: What do you do now with him? What does the team think? What does the world need? All that comes into play. It’s fun for us but it’ll be interesting for audiences what we do with him.

bg93,"Maybe this is a dumb question, but *why* is there an assumption that this will make more than BvS? 

BvS's cultural impact was that it was *bad* with memes like sadfleck. Now I don't want to overstate this effect, but I think it would be valuable to compare to another franchise that had it's brand go from ""cool"" to ""bad"". Transformers. 

Domestically:

Transformers: $320 million

Transformers 2: $400 million

Transformers 3: $350 million

Transformers 4: $245 million

If Justice League comes out and is received poorly, I think it's going to drop. Not as huge as the drop from Transformers 3 to 4, but maybe a few million. 

So I'd say $310 domestic, down $20 million (because I do expect it to be received poorly). Internationally, I have no idea, so I'll assume it doesn't change.

realwillwatson,"**an unpopular opinion:**  Those aren't movies. Those are two-hour action figure commercials with 175 million dollar budgets.

Superhero movies can be done right, but in recent years I just haven't been feeling it. They usually get away with saying crap like that because it's a safe bet they'll make their money back. Once you buy the ticket, it doesn't matter. They made their money. Also, the majority of the people buying tickets don't really know good or bad dialogue as well as screenwriters. If they get some CG destruction porn or other computer generated eye candy in the next minute or so, they don't really care about the people talking. Most of our giant blockbuster movies are just forgettable popcorn movies/2-hour babysitters.

Even Marvel's been slacking recently, though I bet it'll change with movies like the new GotG and Spider-Man. I have hope for the DCEU though with the new Justice League trailer, even though it wasn't consistently pretty or attention-getting.

But this is just my opinion. I think the bar has just been set so low for blockbusters today because they just make money. Lots of it. Now that they have deep pockets they stop trying. That's not everyone though.

RedBarrel,"&gt; Just because Marvel gave (4/6 of) its heroes movies before Avengers doesn't mean that that's the only way to pull it off.

It certainly isn't the only way to pull of a good story, but the Avengers and Justice League both share something that the X-Men and other super teams don't. The entire appeal is that the characters are coming over from their own distinct stories. With JL, only half of them are, and even that's being generous since Wonder Woman, Batman, and Superman already met. Would Avengers have been as satisfying as it was if Thor and Captain America were both fighting alongside Iron Man in Iron Man 2, and only Thor got a solo movie between Iron Man 2 and Avengers, and Hulk didn't get his own movie at all? It still could have been good, but what a huge wasted opportunity.

What I mean is having more episodes that individually team up members of the ghost crew with other rebels. It would feel more like Clone Wars where you had different stories focusing on different Jedi.  We've seen how everyone has grown into a capable leader, so it seems the next logical step. It would also show how big and spread out the rebellion can get, and take care of the problems like ""Why wasn't X at Yavin/Hoth/Endor?""

It would mean breaking up the family a bit, but that's not to say we wouldn't see them back together between missions and even on major ones.  After a season of everyone being separated, a big reunion episode would feel amazing. ",dffef47,t3_61g405,,6,starwarsrebels,,,2017-03-26

After that I read some Marvel Cosmic plus events (GotG, Nova, Thanos Imperative), Avengers Disassembled, New Avengers by Bendis, Dark Reign (Specifically Dark Avengers), Siege, some runs on Daredevil, Hawkeye, Immortal Iron Fist, Invincible Iron Man (by Fraction), Alias, Black Panther by Priest, etc.

For DC's side the first story I remember reading was Watchmen by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon. I didn't appreciate it as much at the time because I had little experience with reading comics but after that I read Hush, Long Halloween, Batman Year One, Batgirl Year One, Superman Birthright, All-Star Superman, the first few issues of New 52 Justice League, a decent chunk into New 52 Batgirl, Omega Men, etc.

So I credit Ultimate Spider-Man as the start of all that, really. And while the Spider-Man movies by Sam Raimi made him my favorite superhero, Ultimate really cemented him as my all time fave. ",dfey5gw,t3_61igd2,,4,comicbooks,,,2017-03-26

BiDo_Boss,"Don't you think people who watch The Sixth Sense unspoiled enjoy it more than those who watch it when the twist is spoiled?

Of course! Now this is not specific to plot twists only, it applies to any movie elements people could experience for the first time whem they're watching the film, therefore giving them the full experience, maximizing their enjoyment.

As I said, this doesn't only apply to plot points, but also to awesome dialogue, funny jokes, cool shots, good action, etc... 

You might be thinking that I shouldn't be watching any trailers at all, which I do, when it comes to films I'm already excited for. I haven't seen any of the Justice League trailers even though I'm a comic book collector and DC fanboy. But the problem is movies that I'm not very excited for, or don't know much about. I like to watch trailers for those to learn more about the tone, the premise, and the production values. Good reviews alone won't push me over the edge, because Manchester by the Sea, La La Land,  Civil War, Hacksaw Ridge, Deadpool, Silence, Don't Breath, and Swiss Army Man all got good reviews last year. But the core fans of each film are severely different. And trailers would help the most with deciding which ones are for you. And I would rather these trailers don't reveal too much.

DerekLake,"Martian Manhunter is certainly far more iconic and more developed as a character. But Cyborg is both interesting in his own right (and can be), and is more suitable at this stage to the largely Earth-bound story they are trying to tell. I do think though that, as with Superman, the League isn't complete without Martian Manhunter. Together with a fully developed Trinity plus Flash and a more regal Aquaman, Martian Manhunter provides much of the heart and soul of the Justice League in a way that characters like Green Lantern or even Batman alone cannot provide. Superman, Wonder Woman and Flash each contribute more than most to the JL's mission, spirit and heart, but Martian Manhunter is certainly crucial if they ever want to create a larger, truer ""League"" of superheroes.

Personally, I think it'd work really well to introduce him in a Superman film. Their stories are near parallels but distinct enough that you could have quite the strong story. Perhaps even a story involving Brainiac and Supergirl.",dffvw4b,t3_61mma5,,4,DC_Cinematic,,,2017-03-26

Kuchenjaeger,"I've wanted to collect my thoughts on this topic for a while now, so here we go:

First of, her **visual design**:

Let's be blunt: Yang is very pretty, and she was obviously designed to be so. Long, blond hair, the biggest breasts among the main characters, she shows ample amounts of cleavage and her stomach too. Add shorts into the mix and what you get is basically every teenage boys wet dream. Her hunter outfit even adds stockings. Although personally, my favourite part of her visual design are her eyes. I love that vibrant purple.

Her classic outfit is great aswell. I love the brown and yellow colour scheme, and the whole ""assymetric"" look makes her really stand out once you realize it.

Secondly, her **personality**:

Yang is arguably the deepest character in the show. On the surface she is what many people would expect when they first see her: Loud, bubbly, cocky, incredibly cheerful, outgoing. But once you get past that, you get an incredibly caring young woman that went through a lot of hardships in her short 17 years. She lost her mother(Summer), only to then find out that Summer wasnt even her biological mom. No, that honor goes to Raven, who left her family pretty much immediately after Yang was born. And after her mothers death, her father ""Kinda shutdown for a while"", causing her to step in and play the part of Ruby's mom, at least for some time. This obviously forced her into a position she wasn't ready for. But she powered through it, and became stronger because of it
(This is also reflected her semblance, which lets her grow stronger with each hit she takes).
Like I said, she is incredibly caring. It doesn't really matter who it is, she is always willing to be there for them. Especially those that are close to her.

And you can see how important her loved ones are to her. Just look at her reaction when Blake doubted her after the Mercury incident. Never before has a character crying impacted me so much. The pain on her face and in her voice(mad props to Barb for this one) was intense. 

She is not perfect. She's emotional. She's got anger inssues. She sometimes acts without thinking. But that's okay. Because she is supposed to be human. Relatable. And humans have flaws.

^^Also ^^she ^^likes ^^puns, ^^and ^^so ^^do ^^I. ^^Like, ^^A ^^LOT.

Last, her **fighting style**:

I LOVE IT SO MUCH! My favourite characters in shows and even games were always the ones that got into the enemies face. That's why I almost always play tanks. League of Legends? My favourites are still Maokai and Warwick. Mass Effect? You bet your ass I chose Vanguard to jump into the enemies' face and blast them with a shotgun. Monster Hunter? Why hello there comically over-sized lance and shield. You get the idea. I mean hell, Agnimon was always my favourite Digimon. And that dude is a brawler that uses fire. What do you know?

Her weapons are so cool as well. I mean. SHOTGUN GAUNTLETS! How much more ""I'm gonna fuck you up"" can you get?

KingBrandoTheIgit,"DC Comics have recently been making crossover comics with companies you'd never expect. Some of these including ""Green Lantern meets Star Trek"", ""Batman and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", and the most recent ongoing crossover series ""Justice League vs Power Rangers"". 

However this isn't the first time they've done this. Back in the 90's, DC had a crossover amalgam series with Marvel that went on for some time, appropriately named ""DC vs Marvel Comics"". 

The story for that is a bit complicated but I'll try to sum it up. 

Two godly brothers who personify the DC and Marvel Universes become aware of the other's existence, and challenge one another to a series of duels involving each universe's respective superheroes. The losing universe would cease to exist. The story had an ""out of universe"" component in that the outcomes of primary battles were determined by readers voting. At one point, the Specter and the Living Tribunal mesh together both universes (including heroes) making strange mixed characters like Super Soldier, Iron Lantern, Dark Claw, Spider-Boy and Lobo the Duck.

blizzard-op,"Identity Crisis: A couple of Justice League members were secretly mind wiping villains if they ever found out about any of the heroes identities. This was all brought to light when a heroes wife was killed and everyone joined up to find her killer.

Marvel had to literally reboot Tony Stark's mind after the first Civil War because no one could stand him after everything he'd done. If you don't know what he did: I enlisted the aid of multiple known murdering supervillains to hunt down other heroes and put osborn in charge of them, along with Reed Richards and a Skrull disguised as Hank Pym he created clone of Thor after stealing some of his genetic DNA (strand of hair), imprisoned any captured superheroes and tossed them in a Negative Zone prison.

Hal Jordan (Green lantern) is technically the second character named Green Lantern. The first is a character named Alan Scott who was a different kind of lantern. He was a Golden Age character but got brought back into the fold along with a couple other golden age heroes to be the Justice Society of America on a parallel universe.

soulreaverdan,"Originally, the JSA was the equivalent of the Justice League from Earth-2. They crossed over periodically with the Justice League throughout the years. 

After Crisis on Infinite Earths, they had their origins changed. Their new origins were as the *original* group of heroes that fought during World War II, as their comic adventures from that era were printed. Because Hitler possessed an artifact that gave him control over metahumans, the JSA held down the home front while the army boys fought in the actual war. However, the increasingly paranoid actions of McCarthy and the Red Scare wanted the JSA to unmask themselves after accusations of being communists, and they stepped down, leaving a vacuum for the JLA to fill.

In more modern stories, they're used as the older, original characters of various legacies that take the younger generation of characters under their wing to help train and motivate them, especially characters that are directly related (blood or power wise) to various heroes they fought with during the war. The JLA is always busy with saving the world, and can't always have the time or resources to take a bunch of newbies on for training, so the JSA decided to fill that need.

The founding members tend to be Ted Grant, the original Wildcat, Jay Garrick, the original Flash, and Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern. Power Girl is often also folded into the founding members or as the chairwoman due to her origins from Earth-2 putting her in a similar position as them. Doctor Fate, Hawkman, Starman, Sandman, The Specter, Hourman, and other Golden Age DC heroes also tend to be involved. If not them, then their descendants or those who inherited their powers.

Out-of-universe, DC is preemptively trying to downplay the face-value similarities between Cyborg and Ironman. Of course most people know the difference between a man in a robot suit and a man who is part robot, but some people are pretty dumb and take everything at face-value.

source: hoop-math.com

I've talked about how these different players get there shots before and its an important part of why people view Fultz as the #1 pick: he gets his own shots. If you look across the board, the one thing that sticks apart is that Fultz shots more unassisted shots than anyone else, and he does it well.

Specifically, look at the 2pt and 3pt jumpers. Because of his terrible team, Fultz was forced to take a lot of pullup jumpers this season. He shoots more 2pt jumpers than anyone else, and he does it more efficiently than all of them. And if you bring up Lonzo's slightly higher percentage, note that Lonzo has taken ~27 2pt Js, while Fultz has taken ~ 201. Jackson and Tatum also do pretty well in this category, but they don't sniff Fultz on 3pts. 

Now you might say ""Well, pullup 2 pointers are the most inefficient shots in the game. Fultz is bad for taking them and Lonzo is smart for avoiding them."" This is true in theory, but again, you have to realize that no one else on Washingtons team can create offense or knock down shots. 

If you look at [UCLA's](http://hoop-math.com/UCLA2017.php) and [Washington's](http://hoop-math.com/Washington2017.php) respective shot overviews, you'll see that Lonzo had 3 other kids on UCLA shot &gt;40%, and one shot 35%. In Washington, Fultz had 1 shooting  &gt; 40 and one shooting 37%. 

Their teams are simple leagues apart. But at the end of the day, Fultz can create at all 3 levels (rim, mid-range, 3) and he can also create for others (5.9/3.2 ast/to). Lonzo is very good at creating for others, but he can't create for himself. He's decent at attacking the rim (nowhere close to Fultz) but he doesn't do it often, as you can tell from the differing FTA (2.7 compared to 6.7). Ball can't create at the mid-range at all. He can't create while going to his right, and probably never will. He can make 3pt shots, but aside from his stepback, he can't really pullup from there either. Jackson can create for others, and he's also a great defender, but I'm not convinced by his shot. His 55% from the line makes me think he will be more like Justice Winslow than Kawhi Leonard. His shot form is kinda ugly and he's got a small hitch. If he can figure it out, he could be the best player out of the draft, but Fultz has it all figured out, he's got the physicals (6'4, 6'10 wingspan) and he's got craftiness I haven't seen since Kyrie. He's as sure a superstar as any, while every other top prospect has some weakness that could hold them back. 

Edit: and here's a follow up that addressed some more points: 


&gt;I agree with your comparison to Kyrie. He does remind me of Kyrie, and I really like Kyrie. Uncle Drew is amazing. But Kyrie needs to ball to be successful. He's a liability on defense and has one of the high usage rates in the league.


I said he's crafty like Kyrie. Actually he's more crafty like Harden, but I was comparing college fultz to college Kyrie. College Harden has nothing on either of them. But I'm not comparing Kyrie and Fultz as overall players. And yes, Kyrie is a liability on defense. But he's also 6'2 with a 6'3 wingspan. Fultz is 6'4 with a 6'10 wingspan. Not only that, but we saw from the finals last year that PG defense isn't as important as offense. 

&gt;This is the point I'm trying to make about Fultz. He's an excellent scorer, he's proven that already. But does he make his team better? I'm trying to sound like Lavar here, I'm being honest. Those stats kind of prove my point. All of those unassisted shots means that he is creating his own shots while his teams are standing around. If you want an isolation player, then Fultz is your guy, no doubt.

Actually, Fultz has a higher assist percentage *and* lower turnover percentage than Ball. Fultz: 35.8%/13.4%, Ball: 31.4%/18.3%. So going by the stats, Fultz assists his teammates at a higher rate than Ball does, and he turns the ball over less. All of this while having a higher usage rate. So he does make his team better. You just don't seem to understand the point that *Washington is a terrible terrible team*. 

&gt;I just think the stats on unassisted shots and the Kyrie comparison kind of prove my point. Fultz needs the ball the be effective.

Again, Fultz is doing what he can with what he has. Do you blame Lebron for having a 38% usage rate in the 2015 finals when KLove and Kyrie went down? No, he had to take over because *there was no one else on the team*.

&gt;But I see Jackson being an immediate contributor. Free throws are something you can work on. That's just some extra time in the gym.

You can't just dismiss this like that. You think Howard, Jordan and Drummond don't practice? Furthermore, the point isn't so much that he's bad at FTs. The point is that FT% is a good NBA predictor for shooting overall. Justice Winslow similarly had a high 3pt% and a low ft%, and he's now one of the worst shooters in the league.

&gt;Same thing with Ball's jump shot. Lots of players have adjusted their jump shot and have been just fine.

Same thing here. Have you seen Ball play? Unless he reinvents his shot, he literally cannot go right and pull-up, it's *physically* impossible. That won't change. I'm confident that he'll be great at 3pt catch-and-shoot, but he will never be able to pullup from midrange, or going right. It's not something he can ""adjust"". He will either completely redo his shot (which will take years) or he just won't be able to do it.

&gt;Maybe it just comes down to personal preference. I do not like the idea of a 'shot creator'. To me, that just means you're not sharing the ball. I more of a pick-and-roll kind of guy, so I think teamwork should create the shot, not one individual player.

Hopefully you got the point from the ast% I showed that Fultz is not a blackhole who only shoots himself. He's a great distributor, and he will create for others at the NBA level. But like Lebron, just because he has a high usage rate doesn't mean he isos all day. He tries to get his teammates involved, they just can't score. [Read this article](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2695960-markelle-fultz-is-the-prototype-meet-the-nba-drafts-2017-superstar-in-waiting). Some quotes to consider:

""All this while limiting his attempts during the first five minutes of each contest to inspire a shorthanded Washington team, which he leads with nearly six assists a night.""

“I guarantee that if you ask anyone who is guarding me, they won’t say I’m taking plays off,” Fultz says. “It’s actually a compliment to me that I make the game look that easy, where people think I don’t play that hard.”

“You hear people up in the stands telling him to shoot more, to do more,” says David Crisp, a sophomore guard and Fultz’s dorm mate. “It’s pretty crazy for a guy to be averaging 23 points and six assists to be told he’s not doing enough. I don’t know what else he could do.”

My closing remarks: his team SUCKS. That's why they were so bad. Basketball is a team game. Fultz won MVP in the FIBA tournament. That's what he can do when he actually has a team around him. You can dismiss him however you want, but he will be a superstar in the league.",dfh3unf,t3_61t5cm,,12,bostonceltics,,,2017-03-27

CycloneSwift,"*The Dark Knight Returns* presented a pretty out-of-character Superman, and *Injustice* Supes was mad. Realistically, Superman would be on the anti-registration side. He knows from experience with Lex and Waller exactly what would happen if the people in power had that information on all superheroes.


Batman, however, has been collecting such data for years. He would likely find a way to infiltrate the registration program, cutting out the government and other powerful figures as much as possible so he could keep the system to himself and the Justice League. Of course, someone like Lex or Waller would find a way to stick around, and would ultimately form an uneasy alliance with the Bat to keep the population safe (after N52 Lex's character arc, I'm guessing Lex would be more likely to ally with Batman).


Otherwise, this roughly falls into a less intense version of *Injustice* with a slightly different lineup. Diana, Barry, Hal and Arthur would side with Bruce, while Wally, Dick, Ollie and Laurel would side with Clark. I could see Barbara and the Titans going either way. Now we get to the villains. The Joker would be leading his own faction sort of similar to Clark's, except, well, as twisted as you'd expect seeing as it's the fucking Joker. He might even get Bizarro or Zod to join to directly parallel Superman's side and help in the fight against Batman. As a result, Harley would also end Bruce's side, wanting to get as far away from Joker, and the side which he's mimicking, as possible. Batman would also get the rest of the Suicide Squad.

Dc has only ever had 2 movies cross 1b, Nolan's Batman movies. And they just barely did that. The marvel universe has proven to be a bigger draw around the world than DC",dfim2jz,t3_61zdp2,,12,boxoffice,,,2017-03-28
Cypherex,"His invulnerability depends on whatever the plot calls for. If a car runs into him at 100 mph, the car will just stop and get heavily dented and he'll barely notice. If a supervillain swings a car at him at roughly 100 mph and hits him with it, he'll get knocked back and stunned. It's inconsistent because he's so hard to write for. The battle would be boring if everything that hit Superman just bounced off of him and then he defeated the bad guy in 5 seconds. 

There have been attempts to explain his inconsistent strength/durability. His [world of cardboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl_5UwS57X8) speech from the Justice League cartoon is one of my favorites. The basic idea here is that he actually *tones down* his strength whenever he's in an actual fight just so he doesn't accidentally kill people. Punch someone too hard and they go flying through several buildings (as seen in the video) killing who knows how many people inside those buildings. 

There's also [this famous scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWyj9ORkj8w) from the movie Superman vs The Elite. The major theme of the movie is about how The Elite are superheroes that are actually willing to kill the bad guys. Superman tries to show them why that's wrong and they end up fighting. Superman decides to show them just how scary it is to go up against someone vastly more powerful than them who has murderous intent. At the start of the clip Superman was holding back like he always does because he didn't want to actually kill them. After they supposedly defeat him, he lets loose and we see just how powerful he is. And if you're wondering how they're breathing on the moon, they used magic or psychic powers or something to make a bubble of air on the moon. And if you want to see how the above scene ends, here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knCOTgghbhU

It's like with Justice League. Absolutely everyone agress Superman is going to show up at some point. Shit, most of the comments are about how he WASN'T revealed yet. So by proxy of it, we all know he's in the movie, yet for some reason, when he finally shows up in a trailer down the line, everyone will go crazy saying it's spoiling the entire movie.

It's a quite interesting character.

He's just a child, but whenever he screams ""SHAZAM"" he basically [turns into a God](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/5/53/Billy_Batson_001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110619230151), Superman-like.

Due to being both a child and an adult he's usually the link between Justice League and Young Justice, but in other hand is [love life usually s*cks due to his ""double age""](http://ifanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JSA-59-2004.jpg)

He once beat [~~H~~ercules](https://static4.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11127/111270529/5558112-8495661619-shaza.jpg).

His greatest enemy is Black Adam, and interesting bit, [Black Adam married Isis](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6b/dc/5a/6bdc5ad3cec295bde82ad7056f4f29dd.jpg) in a ceremony where ~~Captain Marvel~~ Shazam acted as *priest* (since he's technically a representation of several Gods he can marry people...)

Other enemies include [Mister Mind](https://static5.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/15659/1808990-mr.mind.jpg), [King Kull](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/b/ba/Kru'll_bb2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140512200304) and [Doctor Sivana](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/shazam/images/b/b1/Doctor_Sivana_01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090914211202)

He was created in 1940, and was one first Super-heroes to have a ""Super-family"", The [Marvel family](http://images.furycomics.com/viewer/31/310306bb392760f2c2cbe9e73067ae65/0.jpg), which also included Hoppy, [The Marvel Bunny](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/4/4a/Hoppy_9.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20071101121649) and of course [Mister Tawky Tawny](https://static3.comicvine.com/uploads/original/4/49448/2458311-doll.jpg) he's the ""Hobbes"" of Billy (while most people see just a doll he's in fact a anthropomorphic tiger)

He was truly popular in the 50s. He's referenced in a Beatles's song ""The continuing story of bungallow Bill"" ([lyrics](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/beatles/thecontinuingstoryofbungalowbill.html)), and Elvis got a lot of inspiration from Captain Marvel Junior, from [hairstyle](http://captainmarveljr.elvis.com.au/images/cmj-elvis-publicity.jpg), [clothes](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/120997/3986721-6468987168-capta.JPG), [etc...](http://www.elvisblog.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/TCB-on-Lisa-Marie3.jpg)

* **Action comics**

* **Superman: Lois and Clark**

* **DC Universe Rebirth**

* Probably **Aquaman** (haven't read it yet, but Abnett is always good and the art looks great too).

whydoyouonly,"**Booster Gold/Flintstones** - Mark Russell has been nailing the Flintstones ongoing, and this looks like its going to be so much fun. Not to mention the Jetsons finally getting a run.

**Justice League of America #2** - Last issue really clicked with me, should be good fun.

**Kamandi Challenge #3** - This series has been kinda underwhelming so far, so this may be it.

**Suicide Squad/Banana Splits** - Picking this up purely for the backup.

**Infamous Iron Man #6** - Still mildly surprised at how much I’m enjoying this series, each issue has been satisfying and it doesn’t seem to suffering from Bendis’ decompression.

**Inhumans Prime** - So excited for this, another ongoing for Ewing can only be a good thing.

**Man-Thing #2** - Stine had a few teething problems with the first issue, but it was still good enough to hook me.

**Occupy Avengers #5** - Very excited to have Walta as the new ongoing artist for this.

**Star-Lord #5** - It’s a shame that nothing has really happened with the Shocker since Superior Foes, glad to see of all people Zdarsky is the one to do something with him.

**X-Men Prime** - Almost all of the new X-titles look intriguing at the very least, fingers crossed this sets them up in a good place.",dfiaq6c,t3_61yoki,,5,comicbooks,,,2017-03-28

**Infamous Iron Man #6**- Surprisingly good series and the reveal at the end of last issue was fantastic. I'm expecting big things from this book.

**Inhumans Prime #1**- I'm gonna be picking up both Royals and Secret Warriors so this seems pretty logical.

**X-Men Prime #1**- Resurrxion is almost here! Hopefully this is a good reboot of the X-Men and I'm excited for a lot of titles that are coming out.

**Jughead: The Hunger #1**- Not really too gripping of a premise but I'm always down for gorgeous Francavilla art. Plus it fills the hole in my heart left by Afterlife with Archie's delays.

**Justice League of America #3**- I hated the last issue, this will be the last one if it doesn't pick up. It was all over the place and character motivations felt strange and contrived.",dfibfyb,t3_61yoki,,5,comicbooks,,,2017-03-28

BTAS

Justice League then Justice League Unlimited (essentially they're the same show Unlimited just expanded the roster and you get stories with characters like Green Arrow, Black Canary etc.

Young Justice, with the news that season 3 is FINALLY coming now is a great time to watch it. 

Honourable mentions: Batman Beyond is good with a great movie to go along with it, I've also heard that Superman the animated series and the short lived Green Lantern ones were pretty good too but I haven't seen them.

Grand_Imperator,"&gt; All of it is a product of latent human consensus.

The game universe actually demonstrates this not to be true in many ways. I imagine many Mages (and even many Technocrats) are likely to view the universe through this lens, but that seems to amount to hubris (just how much hubris may depend on just how strong the consensus is—could it literally write vampires out of existence? Possibly, but it seems more likely that what Vampires do (including their own version of magic) is not consensus-dependent at all; the Technocrats and Mages alike stretch their paradigm to fight to explain why this is (it's some sort of latent/unconscious consensus/acceptance of their powers? That's a stretch). But there are indeed entities that give zero shits about the consensus.

&gt; Humans, being latently magical, have subconsciously fucked up the world, their subconscious making vampires, werewolves, Weavers and spirits.

I think this is off historically. This is an overly human-centric view of the world, and while many groups are prone to being human-centric, I don't find this entirely accurate.

&gt; If humans lost thier ability to do magic, the world would return to clockwork thing it was before man started fucking it up.

Was it actually a clockwork thing? I think not. From the perspective of other entities that pre-date humankind, perhaps the humans are the problem, not all of the other entities you mention. They might draw a different inference than you from humans fucking things up—don't cull all of their avatars, just cull them.

&gt; I wish there was a heroic Order of Reason as a counterpoint to the Technocracy.

The Technocracy *are* the heroic Order of Reason? I think whatever you have read or been told about the game universes has been very limited and set into black-and-white boxes.

You're not going to find a group full of perfect heroes. You might find perfect heroes (or near-perfect?) within an organization, but no organization is a monolith. I don't want to strawman your point, but it's not going to be Super Friends or Justice League. It won't be a high fantasy setting (which is where you tend to get 'pure' heroes, and that level of black-and-white ethics generally tends to be in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which itself suffers from requiring an alignment of good/neutral/evil to be slapped on everything).

Technocrats as PCs tend to be quite different (the characters themselves and generally the organization too) than when PCs are Traditionalist mages. This is part of the ST aligning the universe (just nudging it) to fit the players the best.

&gt; In fact, had I played Mage, I had an Etherite who was an Etherite solely because A. she recognized her powers were magical and B. The Order of Reason does not exist.

The perfect Order of Reason you would hope for does not exist, so that makes sense to end up an Etherite.

&gt; She had no use for paradigms, magic is magic, and all of it is an affront to the objective reality real scientists concern themselves with.

But the irony is that this is your character's paradigm, not an objective statement of reality (is that intentional? It's a common perspective actually in different words for many will-workers).

If you recognize magick as magick, then you recognize that there is not an objective reality that scientists confront themselves with. If you believe in an objective reality that scientists confront themselves with, then that is very Technocrat-friendly (or again, an Etherite could also work as a choice; you just don't like what the Technocracy has done with that perspective and believe the Traditions *might* be able to help create that world you prefer).

&gt; Her desire? To drain the swamp completely, because Technocrats are hypocritical jackasses who need to be stripped of them power as much as the Order of Hermes.

You paint with a broad brush, as do most Tradition Mages. I imagine many players of the game who play only tradition mages see this in much the same way (perspectives on the Order of Hermes vary, much of it depending on whether the player is in that specific Order or not).",dfizel4,t3_61ow1z,,3,WhiteWolfRPG,,,2017-03-28

CyberPlatypus,"/u/cuddlyfreshsoftness already adressed 1.

2) The Flash is, and has always been, faster than Superman.

3) Superman is physically the strongest member of the Justice League. It usually depends on the incarnation, but I think the default is to assume that Superman can beat Aquaman in water.

4) Aquaman has a whole slew of powers. Honestly, most of these aren't really negatively affected by him being out of water. He has super strength, super durability, super sight, can swim at supersonic speeds, he's an expert fighter, and expert tactician, he has a bit of telepathy (so he can control ocean life), and is the ruler of one of the most powerful and technologically advanced civilizations on the planet. As such, he also has control of one of the strongest military forces on the planet. I realize that that the last two aren't really a superpower, but I thought they ought to be mentioned. He also has a magic trident that can cut Superman (but this depends on the incarnation).

5) How the DCEU Cyborg was made has not been revealed yet. His generic origin story though is that Cyborg (as a normal human) was mortally wounded and near death. In order to save his life, his father used an alien device (it's a lot more than this, but that's beyond the scope of this question) called a Motherbox to heal him. This made him who he is. Because of the unique circumstances of his creation and because they used a Motherbox, one can not simply mass produce Cyborgs.

6) To the best of my knowledge, it depends on the incarnation. As far as I can recall, the Justice League is a private group. It is not controlled by any country or government. Because of that, I don't think they have to do any taxes. Who would they pay the taxes to anyway? Most of the money comes from Batman anyway, and I don't think anybody outside of the Justice League or Bat family even knows where Batman gets his money from.

SuperMoonky,"I haven't posted it in a while, but the LEGO Guide must be used again for the sake of bringing LEGO into more lives. If anyone has questions ask away, happy to answer any question related to the LEGO series.

**Disclaimer:** *I am an employee of Gamesplanet, this should not sway you in any way but I want to make people aware of it.*

**LEGO Batman 1** - A fairly ok title with your favourite caped crusader launching himself into the spotlight for his first solo outing. The game has not aged well and has some poor mechanics (especially in the vehicle handling). A nice little title to jump in but not required if you want to move to LEGO Batman 2. Personally I would say avoid this unless you're really interested.

**LEGO Batman 2** - Now this is where the LEGO titles of today started off. First game to include voice acting (with Troy Baker giving a wonderful Batman) and the first one to feature a fully open world (previous games were always small hubs with levels). The story is pretty much Lex Luthor teaming up with the Joker and for anyone who has seen the LEGO Batman movie you'll know what the plot is. Best addition to this is the addition of the Justice League and heroes such as Superman (when he is flying around in the open world the John Williams theme plays), The Flash, Wonder Woman and the rest. This was the best LEGO title in my book till LEGO Marvel took the crown.

**LEGO Batman 3** - This was created by the same guys who did LEGO Batman 2 and LEGO Marvel and it shows in the quality, the story follows on from LEGO Batman 2 but only a small link between the two and once again has the Justice League featured alongside Batman and Robin trying to beat Brainiac. The difference between this and LEGO Batman 2/LEGO Marvel is that it takes place on several hub worlds and it doesn't feel as connected as the previous games, that aside it has some wonderful moments (including an awesome ending and a level involving 60's Batman), Voice acting is superb too, they have cameos from Adam West, Conan, Stephen Amell and more. If you're a LEGO fan you will enjoy this, the season pass is not amazing, 6 packs with 1 level and some characters - each level is around 10 minutes long with the best one being the Arrow DLC. You also have a couple packs that are **NOT** part of the Season Pass, these are all characters/vehicles and feature no levels. There is also 2 Free packs, first is Rainbow Rider and the other is Heroines and Villainesses Character Pack (just released!). Lastly, you have a huge amount of Characters in this game - every DC character you could think of is in this. I still feel this game lacks a little bit of what made LEGO Batman 2 and LEGO Marvel great but it's still up there as a decent LEGO title.

**LEGO Movie The Videogame** - Honestly I do think this is the weakest entry out of the recent LEGO games, better if you have seen the movie and enjoyable for a short time if you haven't but the problem is the game felt a bit rushed (to tie into the movie probably) and in a few places it lacks the magic other titles have managed to capture. It's still a LEGO game but if you're playing it after playing some of the others you might feel it's a bit lacking. That said it does feature clips from the movie and it's still funny, just missing some gameplay IMO.

**LEGO Harry Potter 1 and 2** - I can't speak for 2 since I have yet to complete 1, what I can say is that if you're a fan of Harry Potter these are probably some of the best games you'll find dealing with his world, Harry Potter 1 is the first four films and Harry Potter 2 is the last set of movies. You might not get the story as much unless you have seen the movies as these do not feature voice acting.

**LEGO LOTR** - This is pure movie magic, it takes the world of Peter Jackson and dumps it into LEGO form. You have an open world Middle Earth to explore with locations from every movie, from Hobbiton to Mordor. Another game to feature voice acting (this one takes it directly from the movie - but cut slightly to make it work in a family friendly game). It has hilarious moments from each movie redone in LEGO to make them even more funny. One of my favourite LEGO titles of all time.

**LEGO Hobbit** - This is pretty much the same formula as LEGO LOTR reusing the same Middle Earth map from LOTR but changing/replacing some places to make it into the Hobbit trilogy instead. The game features the first 2 movies only (**NOTE: They are not adding the third movie via DLC anymore**) and might feel a bit incomplete because of that. I personally found it enjoyable, but felt it lacked something that LOTR had.

**LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game** - Takes the famous Pirates of the Caribbean franchise to new waters, it features all 4 movies and has around 20 levels (5 per film). Gameplay is very much the same as in every other LEGO game, sword fighting in this feels as good as fighting with a lightsaber in the LEGO Star wars games. You have everything that makes a great pirate game, boat fights, treasure hunting and Jack Sparrow. The game does not feature voice acting unlike some of the other movie games but this isn't a bad thing as they have done a good job recreating the scenes in LEGO. This is the only LEGO game to feature trading cards (if you care).

**LEGO Indiana Jones 1 and 2** - I have not played 2, I shall make people aware of this first before I start - from my knowledge the 2nd game is superior because it includes 4 films and not 3 like the original adventures, it also has more gameplay and a level creator. From what I played of 1 however, this is a great game and it's just as magical as the LEGO Star wars titles. It's not the best Indiana Jones game ever created, but it does a good job bringing back the nostalgia the first films brought. You even have a LEGO version of short round, how cool is that? No voice acting sadly, but it's made up by the wonderful music from the movies. I may have to update this section because I haven't played LEGO Indiana Jones 1 in a while.

**LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga** - The game that started it all, before LEGO Star wars all we had were games like LEGO Island and LEGO Racers but along came this out of basically nowhere. This set the foundations for all LEGO recent LEGO titles, it's gameplay and humour were unique and set TT Games path for the future. All 6 Star Wars movies are included in this package, you have around 62 levels in total (6 per film, 20 bounty hunter levels and 6 bonus levels), a vast array of characters and the ability to create Darth Vader with Princess Leia's bikini body. LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga to me will always be the title that started it all and it's got so many good moments in it that it still remains in my top 5 LEGO games to this day. It's not aged great though, graphically it's dated but gameplay still holds up - despite a couple issues that got fixed in later LEGO titles, but it's a great way to experience the Star Wars experience and a fantastic way to get keep the entire family entertained.

**LEGO Star Wars III - The Clone Wars** - LEGO Star Wars III is essentially The Clone Wars movie and TV series wrapped up in a bundle. Graphically it's a massive improvement over The Complete Saga, some levels even feature you having control over an army and building structures (not that complicated or hard, but a nice change of pace). Levels felt more exciting and the space levels were a particular highlight for me, everything felt polished but I still feel like Complete Saga had more going for it. That's not to say Clone Wars is bad, it's just that if you had to pick one I'd go for The Complete Saga as it's a better package.

**LEGO Jurassic World** - Game covers all 4 movies in the Jurassic franchise (including the latest), it has 2 massive hub worlds (Isla Nublar and Isla Sorna) with a ton to do, 5 levels per movie (20 in total - possibly more if they have bonus levels but I am not that far into the game yet to answer) and the ability to play as dinosaurs AND create your very own dinosaur made up of parts of dinosaurs you unlock. The audio for voices/music are directly copied from the movies and some extra voice overs have been put in where they had to, infact my only gripe with the game the sound is noticeable and a little low quality at times (especially near the start). Other than that, I feel this game might be the best LEGO game I have played since LEGO Marvel came out in 2013. It's a refreshing game and I look forward to finishing it. Keep in mind this is my first couple hours on the game and it might change depending on the rest of the game.

**LEGO Marvel Superheroes** - Save the best to last? That's what I have done, this is without a doubt in my mind the best LEGO game to date. Everything is here, a huge list of characters (even some you might not know about), a wide open New York with the Shield Helicarrier above, crazy side mission levels narrated by Deadpool (Nolan North), races, a compelling story and great level design. This is a dream for any LEGO/Marvel fan, if you enjoy any of those then you should pick this up.

**As a disclaimer, I would like to point out none of these have mouse support and all are best played with a controller since a Keyboard can be annoying to aim (but not impossible).**",dfkw4zj,t3_629y9o,,38,GameDeals,,,2017-03-29

SpaceRocker1994,"Call me old school but in my opinion I believe better struggles are portrayed when Parker is trying to figure this shit out on his own and doesn't really have anyone to talk to, in my eyes it makes for better internal conflict, because when you boil it down Spider-Man in his early issues that encompassed his high school life, those issues were meant to represent the struggles of your typical social reject, who at best might have only 2 or 3 friends and can't even tell them about his problems because they wouldn't understand and it would put them in danger. Also I've kinda always believed that Spider-Man stories have generally worked better when he was a solo act and not part of some team, and when he did partner up for a short time with other heroes it really only seemed to work well with characters that were just as well written, I.e. Black cat, daredevil, punisher, The X-Men etc. not to mention when you build up a team like the avengers or the justice league the threat just seems way too unrelateable, and said team is just about as overpowered as superman, but hey that's just my opinion.",dfk6mt5,t3_625i80,,17,Spiderman,,,2017-03-29

Wally West II, the current Kid Flash, can also apparently throw lightning.

The Speed Force isn't actually made of lightning/electricity, despite the aesthetic, so I think it's kind of dumb but whatevs.

We saw parademons and glimpses of what looks to be great set pieces. I'm okay with that. I wish Spider-Man's trailer had scaled back a little but I actually trust Marvel that there are still some good surprises being held back.

samx3i,"This is why I've insisted for years that comics companies like Marvel and DC that have been around for nearly 100 years need to take a ""Generations"" approach. End your entire universe and all the continuity ever. Hard reboot. Captain America was frozen in World War II and is just now being thawed in, say 2020. Imagine that culture shock. Wolverine has been around as least since North America was being settled by Europeans, but the X-Men are just now being officially started by Charles Xavier. Meanwhile, a kid in New York is being bitten by a radioactive spider, etc., etc.

Keep the timeline going in real time. Characters age. If Peter Parker is 16 when he's bitten by a radioactive spider in 2020, he's 26 in 2030 when he marries Mary Jane Watson. 

Characters die and they stay dead. It's a rule. Comic book deaths will actually have meaning. They can take this risk fearlessly because they know another hard reboot is coming at some point. If Spider-Man dies heroicly saving New York City, any number of legacy characters can take his place in this continuity until he's reborn in the next generation. Hell, maybe Peter Parker doesn't even become Spider-Man in the next generation; a Japanese-American high school girl does.

We accept this readily of movies. Imagine if the upcoming Justice League movie was connected all the way back to the Adam West movie and every continuity burp had to be explained by time travel, alternate dimensions, a reality-warping imp, a deal with the devil, it was all a dream, etc.? We don't do that. We just say that was that series and this is this series. We started over with a new vision and different direction. It's the same, but it's new.

The_Reinhardt_Main,"I do not have any high expectations for that movie. Part of the reason Avengers did so well was that each major character had their own movie before hand to give a backstory and slowly set it up for the Avengers to come together. 

Three of the characters from the Justice League were introduced in like a 2 minute section of Batman Vs Superman. So they're introducing the characters while also trying to make a Justice League movie. It would go a lot better if they were patient and released individual movies, there's no good reason to rush it like this.

Having it be a more subdued mission would allow stuff like captain boomerang's spycam boomerang to become absurdly useful.

ZackBop,"If I were writing it:

1. Prologue.  We see the original Age of Heroes (humanity uniting with Themyscira and Atlantis to fend off Darkseid's forces).

2. Recruitment.  Bruce tries to go recruit Arthur.  He says no.  He returns to the Batcave, and Diana meets him there.  They discuss recruiting the other two (Barry and Victor).  Diana agrees to go after Victor, while Bruce says he'll go find Barry.  Victor turns Diana down, but Barry says yes to Bruce (much to his surprise).  They decide to go meet with Gordon to get some more intel on what's going on with the Parademon nest beneath Gotham.  We also get some scenes in there of Arthur and Victor rethinking their decision to turn down the offer.  When the meeting with Gordon finally happens, we see that Arthur and Victor are firmly on board.  Then you get the action set piece in Gotham's tunnels.

3. Struggles.  The team struggles to come together as a cohesive unit.  And what's worse is that they learn that the leader of this Parademon army -- Steppenwolf -- will arrive on Earth at any minute.  He's looking for the Motherboxes so they can turn Earth into another satellite of Darkseid's empire.

4. ""For The Man Who Has Everything.""  In this sequence, we get a glimpse of what Superman's consciousness is experiencing while in his comatose state.  This is where we see him in the black suit.  He imagines his ""ideal"" life on Krypton, his ""ideal"" life in Smallville, and finally his TRUE ideal life in Metropolis (as Superman).  this is where Clark learns that he truly loves being Superman.

5. Steppenwolf.  Steppenwolf arrives and begins collecting the Motherboxes.  The team realizes that they can't win this war without Superman.  Batman goes to visit Lex to see if there is any way to bring him back.  Lex agrees to give him the knowledge that he needs on the condition that he be released from Arkham.  Batman agrees. 

6. Resurrection.  As the team attempts to hold off Steppenwolf, Batman (or whoever) works to bring Superman back to life.  They take his body to the scout ship and do whatever Lex told them needed to be done to bring him back.  Superman returns.

7. Justice League.  The united Justice League works together to destroy Steppenwolf.  Following the battle, Superman is formally introduced to his new teammates.  Maybe they enjoy a home-cooked meal at the Kent farm.

8. Epilogue.  The team goes their separate ways.  Batman returns to Gotham.  Superman returns to Lois in Metropolis.  Lois writes an article about how the world has changed since Superman's arrival, and how we're now living in a new Age of Heroes.  The film ends with the world embracing not only Superman, but his new friends as well.  During this final montage, we hear the words of Jor-El from Man of Steel.  ""You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun, Kal. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.""

csguterres,"I love Dwayne McDuffie for what he did in **Justice League Unlimited** (my favorite cartoon ever) and **Static Shock** (another great show) but Ben 10, honestly, he and the writing team had some great ideas for storylines, like the Highbreed invasion, but they clearly didn't know the characters they were writing. 


They decided that Ben wasn't interesting enough and decided to rework the series around their favorite character Kevin (for example, it's clear that Kevin/Gwen has a lot more screentime than Ben/Julie). Kevin's past is easily forgiven, his psychopathic behavior from OS is changed to ""cool anti hero"" (it's like turning the Joker into Han Solo) and the female protagonist starts crushing hard on him (Gwen's ""Why haven't you asked me out yet?"" is totally cringeworthy especially considering Kevin tried to kill her in OS - at the very least he should be the one pining for her not the other way around).


But I consider AF/UA as an alternate universe. In my mind, the true Ben 10 timeline is the one from OS showed in Goodbye and Good Riddance/Ben 10,000/Ken 10.",dfkwjqv,t3_61ykts,,5,Ben10,,,2017-03-29
Beard_of_Valor,"Frankly I think the entities wouldn't encounter a justice league; as far as we know in wormverse, there is no natural occurrence of powers and they only come about as a result of a critter being selected as the recipient of a new ability that grants them essentially access to more power than they will produce in their lifetime. 

They are unlikely to encounter Superman, The Flash, Green Lantern... and hawk girl. Nor would they likely find a blue woman, Canary, Alexandria, or Eidolon. 

They probably *could* run into something close enough to Dragon, but the tactics power was uniquely useful against AI drones. They probably *could* run into life that resembles the dog-eat-worlds existence before they left their home planet, but that's not the justice League either.

YankeeBlues21,"I'm with you on this. It's not unlike colleges trying to implement their own justice system parallel to the actual one. 

Whatever penalty given in the event a player is accused of something like domestic violence, rape, assault, etc is going to be far too little if they're guilty (in which case they'll be ""suspended"" because they'll be punished by the court system and possibly incarcerated), but draconic if it turns out they're not (and the league just dragged their name through the mud with a suspension for something they didn't do). 

Suspensions should generally be for those off-field situations that are based on being caught in the act and that are generally legal small-fry (like the various substance abuse issues athletes find their way into). ",dfknggr,t3_627q3x,,5,baseball,,,2017-03-29

People know all of this, and whatever their opinions are, they see Justice League as something to look forward too. People aren't expecting a marvel movie anymore. People aren't expecting this movie to be completely different. People want to see this movie. And it's not the trailer that has me all excited. It was a good trailer.

Cryoglobulin,"There is absolutely no doubt the government is committed to combating climate change. However there are 2 points that should be addressed, once again my opinion:

1) While this is an genuine effort, my critique is that it should have been initiated much sooner. The primary reason that the CCP is pouring so much money into this sector in recent years is because they are forced by the evolution of urban demographics. The notion that Chinese people are happy as long as they have more money in the wallet is changing. Rapid urbanization in the past two decades have certainly seen a rise in standard of living by economic standards but not by health measures.

Case in point: when my dad bought a 25 inch Sony colored TV in 1995, it was the largest set in the neighbourhood. No one in my family owned vehicles and having one 2 bedroom apartment was considered ""xiao kang"" living. Fast forward to today, everyone in my family have 2 vehicles, two or three apartments, travel abroad extensively, and have more money than they can spend. With this shift, however economically satisfied, people's overall standard of living have not grown proportionally. This is because instead of worrying about not having enough money, they have shifted their complaints towards pollution and health. For example people care less about how big their apartments are and more so the greenscape around the buildings and approximity to parks and lakes. The government knows this. Graphs and statistics of rising rates of lung cancer, asthma, congestive heart failure can only be buried or glossed over for so long.

Civil unrest in rural areas by farmers are appeased or suppressed by threats, violence, or cash promises (often never delivered). You can't accomplish the same as easily with urban population who have education, wealth, and influence.

2) Chinese people don't really understand climate change on a global scale. This can be chalked up to ""living in a bubble"" ignorance but I feel the problem has much deeper roots. Chiefly, Chinese people are self-centered. While people are near fanatical about preaching and usually practicing familial piety, they hold little loyalty to the community at large. There is no sense of giving without the reward of instant gratification. The west, for all our problems, have at least a much stronger sense of community and with that individual responsibility to uphold the integrity of ones living space. This can be as routine as volunteering, biking instead of driving, to curb side recycling. People in the west, at least those of us who genuinely care, make strong efforts to improve the environment even though there are far less pollution here. Contrast this with China where people routinely choke on smog, efforts to improve climate is really just a war on PM 2.5. Chinese people generally don't give a shit about chunks of ice shelf breaking off Antarctica, they don't care about rising sea levels, they certainly don't lose sleep over rising global temperatures. In fact, no matter how much they complain about the weather, as soon as an outsider criticizes, they are quick to get defensive and say, ""Aiya! This is because the country had to get rich first! Chinese was so poor don't you know?""

These two points link together to highlight my fear in China's ""commitment"" to fight climate change. The CCP are not run by idiots. They know fully well that a careful balance must be struck between supporting industrial growth and appeasing the urbanites. Their commitment is not to the globe as a citizen of this planet, but solely to their legitimacy as China's government. My fear is that they will create policies and introduce stop gap measures to improve pm2.5 in major cities but really have no plans for long term investment to help this global issue. We already saw this when the government cut down on heavy industries around Beijing, but in reality, they just moved the polluters west to places like Sichuan, leading to a rise in pollution in cities like Chengdu. For the CCP, this is a win win strategy as it will appease the Chinese middle class situated around their core power base of Beijing and thanks to Trump, Xi gets to look like a member of the Justice League at the Paris Accord.",dfkip3f,t3_626bfj,,3,China,,,2017-03-29
KSonOfCave,"Yeah, but Hulk does even worse at the box office.

LarBrd33,"Nobody blindly hates DC Comics.  It has some of the most beloved fictional characters in history.

Nobody blindly hates Warner Bros interpretation of DC Characters either.  Every movie they have produced has received warranted criticism.  Some of them, such as Suicide Squad, were just bad movies by any conventional standards we use to determine film quality.  On some level taste is subjective.  The standards by which we use to measure film quality are less subjective.  There's some consensus based on Writing, acting, cinematography, story, etc that allows us to objectively say ""Moonlight"" is a better movie than Cameron Crowe's ""Aloha"".  It isn't a bias against action either.  There's a reason why ""Max Max: Fury Road"" was critically adored and ""Warcraft: The Movie"" wasn't.  You can subjectively like a fingerpainting your 3 year old nephew made more than Monet's ""Water Lilies"", but we can objectively say Monet's work is a greater work of art than the hamburger blob little Timmy made.  

You can't fault anyone for liking these movies in spite of their flaws.  There's plenty of people who love the ""Transformers"" movie series despite a fairly widespread understanding those movies aren't very good.  Warner Bros DC movies make less money and have comparable/worse reviews than those Transformers movies... to each his own.  Like what you want to like.

Wonder Woman and Justice League will be more of the same.  They look like comparable quality films.  They will very likely be torn apart by critics for very valid reasons.  They'll make a lot of money, because of the popularity of those characters.  Fans will be defensive of the films, because they'll see the bad reviews of poorly made cashgrab movies as a personal attack on their favorite characters and their own childhoods.   Similarly, ""Transformers: The Last Knight"" and the upcoming Bumblebee spin-off will likewise receive bad reviews and make a ton of money.  It's ok to like a bad film.

This community would be better off if they were just more honest with themselves.  Sure, there's people with low standards or a poor understanding of film art that are going to think these movies are ""great"".  Others will love these movies for what they are simply because they are live-action versions of their favorite charactrs.  Unfortunately, there's also fans here entirely in denial about the quality of the films.  You don't owe anything to Warner Bros.  You aren't obligated to like the movies they make just because you have a pre-existing love of the characters.   In some ways this community puzzles me.  I doubt any hardcore ""Jem and the Holograms"" fans were ""ride or die"" about the [2015 live-action movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jem_and_the_Holograms_(film)) ... they felt like the studio had let them down by making a bad interpretation of their beloved characters.  Ironically, that movie actually had better reviews than ""Suicide Squad"".   

Maybe it's an inferiority complex, because Marvel Studios tends to do a better job making films out of their characters, but I personally think fans here should direct their anger towards Warner Bros and demand better films.  They have been dropping the ball dating back to the Schumacher Batman films.  The studio lucked out by getting Nolan to make a Batman Trilogy, but beyond that they have really failed these characters.   You fans deserve better.",dfku3xl,t3_6269bn,,3,DC_Cinematic,,,2017-03-29

mansefson,"You guys need to get away from this idea that film critics are rational or even worth paying much attention to. As it stands today, film criticism isn't even better than just listening to another average movie-goers opinion. 10-20 years ago, that wasn't the case, but film criticism has just gotten *awful* over these past few years.

I have no faith whatsoever that film critics will recognize Justice League for being a good film - or the other way around, i.e. saying JL is good even if it's not. Not because I think they're biased against DC - frankly the idea is ridiculous - but because I have no reason at all really to trust them or their opinions.

raysweater,"I recently just did the same. I then binded them all into leather books separated by ""eras"". 

Examples: http://imgur.com/a/Jrl6O and http://imgur.com/a/UTisA

I'm ended up having seven volumes, or eras. 

 1. The Beginning Years

 2. The Bat Family

 3. Tragedy in the Family

 4. Sins of the Past

 5. The Fall of Batman

 6. A New Era

 7. (untitled right now)

Here are two screenshots of the books in each ""Era"". https://m.imgur.com/a/AsamU

The Beginning Years is important because it shows his decision to become Batman, the building of the Batmobile, the first encounter with the Joker, the the building of the Bat Signal, and the origin of the Justice League. 

Obviously from there it gets pretty self explanatory. I have ""Tower of Babel"" there and I don't think I'm going to include it, it's just a good read.

Also, I tried to follow the main chronology as much as possible but made exceptions for my own head canon and obvious reasons (example: Justice League: Origin is New 52, but it fits in the timeline I created perfectly, and where else would you put it? Mad Love is another example, along with including Batman Beyond). 

I'll answer any questions you have as to why I put a book in a certain spot or any other questions. Hope this helps.",dfjfuav,t3_61zvb9,,2,batman,,,2017-03-29

ss_basu,"I was alone on the sofa. The TV was on, infomercials promoting magic weight loss pills had long replaced whatever show I was watching when I fell asleep. It bothered me a little that I didn’t remember what I was watching, but the nights had started blending into each other a long time ago. Surprised at the lack of the usual blanket over me, I sat up.

“You there?” I called. No replies. If I were honest with myself, I should not have expected one. See, tonight I told my wife that the marriage might have been a mistake.

----

I don't remember the day I died for the first time. I must have been a little child. Infant mortality is still high in this world. I must have died hundreds of times in all the possible dimensions before I began to toddle.

Ever wonder why some babies suddenly start crying in the night?

----

Sharing a secret is bigger than sharing a bed or a bank account. She was the only person in the whole world who knew my secret. I told her the night I proposed and she said yes. It was a drunken, care-free, magical moment. In hindsight, it must have been the worst mistake I ever made. She was the only person who would have believed me, and that’s precisely why I should not have told her.

We were not husband and wife, you see. We were keepers of knowledge, sworn in secrecy. Our certificate of marriage was not the only thing keeping us together. She felt responsible for me, the one with the burden of knowing but not being able to share. Our marriage was doomed from the start.

She was angry. And hurt. And shocked. And could not believe her own ears. But she did not cry.

“I don’t think this is working out. You and me, this relationship, this marriage – it’s all been a terrible mistake.” I had told her.

“I feel that I am with you because you know my secret. There’s nothing else between us anymore. I think it will be better for both of us if we do not feel bound by this shared responsibility of keeping me out of mental institutions.” I tried to explain.

“I don’t want to hurt you.” I lied.

She got angry. I got angry. Our voices were raised.

“We don’t have to do anything right now. Can’t you think about it a little?” I bargained.

“How can you think of yourself without me?” She said again and again.

----

I do remember the first time I realised what was happening. I was in class, copying down homework like the good boy I was, when I felt that sudden hollowness in my chest. And I knew. I knew I just died, even though I could still feel the pencil in my hand, could hear the teacher shushing some troublemaker or other, could smell chalk dust and sweat and a ripe apple inside someone's lunchbox.

Science fiction and episodes of Justice League (never been a Marvel fan, sorry) taught me about alternate timelines and parallel universes. I wondered what my selves in those other places did. Were they happy? Did they marry the women who took my wife’s place in those dimensions? Will they feel it when I die?

----

I still wanted my wife with me before I died.

I never felt this. This intensity, this unending waves of death – as if a large worm was boring into my chest. I was sure I was going to die very soon. But then I realised.

It was not me who was dying. Well, it was me. But it was me in those other places, parallel dimensions or whatever. It was death after death after death. I could not count the deaths, but it must have been in millions, in billions. How can I die everywhere in such a short time?

I shouted for her again. No replies. I staggered up. Somehow. I started to move towards the bedroom. Somehow. I wanted to apologise to her before I died because one thing was sure – whatever was killing my other selves in those other places will come for me. Sooner or later.

There was nobody in the bedroom. Where was she? I fell down on the bed and must have passed out from the pain, because I remember nothing from then to the time when somebody slapped me hard and I woke up.

She was standing in front of me. She had a cleaver in her hand. She was covered in blood.

“Wh-wha-?” I croaked.

“I told you. I told you there was not you without me. How could you even think of such a thing?”

“What?” I finally managed to say a full word. I also realised that I could not feel the deaths anymore. Whatever happened in the other places had stopped. Or did it?

“I will not allow you, any version of you, to exist without me.” She hissed.

“You? Why?” There was another, more pressing question I had to ask. “How?”

She smiled. “Why do you think I believed you?”",dflltmp,t3_62c591,,188,WritingPrompts,,,2017-03-30

Japjer,"Someone on the DC sub mentioned something similar.

Their idea was this: Justice League opens with a Flashpoint-esque scene showing the heroes being defeated by Darkseid's forces. In this timeline, Batman had never unified the team and the heroes didn't come together until it was too late.

Batman tells the Flash to warn him about what was coming, so he guns it back in time, screams the message at a sleeping Bruce, and inspires him to form up the team. The movie we're seeing is the after effects of that. ",dfm7wfq,t3_62exc7,,142,FanTheories,,,2017-03-30

DrJonesPHD62,"I've been seeing a whole lot of complaints about this episode. They seem rather menial in comparison to the complaints of the last two seasons. Let's go over what happened in the last two episode 18's.

Season 3:

Oliver, Laurel, and Roy engaged Ra'a al Ghul and the League in one of the worst-edited action scenes in the show's history. Felicity was Felicity. Oliver's identity was outed to Lance and the whole city, but Roy took the fall so everyone conveniently either forgot or stopped caring. Oliver turned himself in, citing the ""everything is my fault"" rhetoric that only really works with Slade and Prometheus as current villains. In short, a whole lot happened but very little was done well.

Season 4:

Darhk's idol is assembled, except for one tiny piece. Diggle blindly trusts Andy even after he catches him rifling through his belongings in search of that piece. Malcolm and the League break in to the bunker and wallop Laurel and Thea, stealing the idol. Darhk stages a pathetic prison break that consists of stabbing two people. The team intercepts and Laurel is stabbed after Darhk uses the easiest to film superpower to paralyze them. The Black Canary dies of a superficial stab wound, but not before confessing her undying love for Oliver and saying he should get back with Felicity (which are two conflicting statements). The oliciters rejoice and we give up.

Season 5:

Adrian's torture has broken Oliver so thoroughly that he can't suit up, can't bring himself to think of himself as the Green Arrow, and can't work with a team. He knows that he's a murderer who doesn't belong with anyone. He breaks up the team (temporarily, because... c'mon) and tries to forcibly cut ties with them. The team is understandably peeved at this since their leader was just abducted and tortured by Adrian Chase. They want justice - but not the kind that blackens and torments the soul. They're not executioners. They're not hammers. They're scalpels. Oliver enlists the bratva to help, which shows just how far he's fallen. Diggle tries to sway him, but he doesn't know what Oliver has done, seen, or endured; how could he? He doesn't realize the extent to which Prometheus broke his friend. His sense of duty leads him to break up the bratva's heist and assassination, and his loyalty to Oliver leads him to reach out multiple times. Oliver eventually concedes, because he realizes that Diggle signed on to follow Oliver into the gates of hell if he needed to do so, and Ollie would do the same for him. Felicity's plot could be seen as non-essential, but this is setting something up. Perhaps it's setting up the fact that Helix is, in some way, affiliated with Promo. Perhaps it's setting up Felicity's eventual turn to villainy and subsequent arrest/death. Either way, there's nothing to complain about; both alternatives show that Promo's plan is deeper and more layered than anyone could have expected. Speaking of which... the ending scene was purely psychotic. Adrian was caught off guard for the first (or arguably second) time, and he took it very poorly. He's going to buckle down and bring heapings of misery upon the team in the near future, all thanks to Dinah and Lance making the presentation at SCPD. Speaking of Dinah, she got some moments, too. She got to shine above the other recruits and team members, including Ollie himself. The title probably threw people for a loop, of course. ""Disbanded."" Team arrow wasn't disbanded. The friendship with the bratva was disbanded.

Really, I don't see how it earned so much hate if its biggest problem is that it's not last week's episode, otherwise known as the perfect Arrow episode.",dfl4hov,t3_62alzf,,28,arrow,,,2017-03-30

People didn't like justice league because Luther was the Riddler, the climax was Bateman hearing the word ""Martha"", which they didn't set up correctly and they're world building to Darkseid, which would be cool if Marvel wasn't doing Thanos. Yes, I realize Thanos is a Darkseid knockoff, but Marvel beat them to the lunch, so for the wide audience, it just looks like they're copying (which, given the number of great villains D.C. has, they may be)

Combine that with the many mistakes they made on Suicide Squad that will come back to haunt them (are they married to Jared Leto's Joker now?) and you've got nothing going for you.

However, with DC's track record thus far, I'm going to go ahead and say this is probably going to feel really really fucking long. Hell an hour and a half is going to have to be spent introducing characters. Not to beat a dead horse, but Marvel earned the Avengers by introducing and establishing their characters before hand. That's why the movie worked, because we didn't need to spend an hour getting to know the cast, and it could just jump right into the plot.

&gt;DC, the house that Batman built ~ Lego Batman (2017)

But yeah, I don't get the negativity about having a Bat-Family universe within the DCEU. The Batman universe is dynamic and full of great characters and stories. It's awesome we get both that AND the rest of the DCEU. The possibilities are endless and it's an exciting time. Just because we get BatFam movies doesn't mean we're not gonna get other DC characters' movies. Hell, we're getting Wonder Woman in June and Aquaman is filming today in Australia! It's awesome.

This applies to the comics and the animated universe too. Yeah, we get more Batman-related comics, video games and animated movies than the other heroes, because bottom-line, they're cashcows for DC. And if Batman brings in the revenue, DC would be a fool not to maximize. But with the exposure that Batman brings, this also leads opportunity to other heroes getting their own comics, video games, movies and animated movies. We're finally getting an animated movie that doesn't have Batman in it since like 5 yrs ago. So, it's happening. Fans have to be patient and also understand that no matter what, Batman IS important to DC's revenue, but that doesn't mean the other superheroes are getting sidelined. For the movies, we have Green Lantern Corps, Flash, Black Adam/Shazam, Justice League Dark all in development that aren't related to the Bat-Fam. ",dfm6qp6,t3_62fimv,,7,DC_Cinematic,,,2017-03-30

Killing Izuna, just makes Madara stronger and soundly out of his reach. 

Final battle with the Uchiha Clan, his killing of Izuna is used as a pretense for Madara telling Hashirama to kill himself. Nearly loses his brother and his clan because of his crowning victory.

Hashirama becomes Hokage, world immediately gets plunged into the First Ninja War when Hashirama gives away Bijuu to their enemies. Hashirama dies and leaves Tobirama the mess to clean up.

Gives Uchiha Clan power over Military Police, Uchiha ostracize themselves refusing to give up leadership positions even when they are majority. Eventually use their privilege to plan a coup when things don't go their way.

Second Ninja War, has legendary fight against psuedo-jinchuriki Kinkaku and Ginkaku because his brother gave away the Bijuu. Dies in this war against nameless faceless jounin that is only possible due to his brother's mistakes.

Chakra focus vs Orochimaru, gets barked down by his brother then pinned by Orochimaru with his brother's chakra.

Fight vs Madara, gets beaten and then pinned to the ground and purposefully humiliated and forced to watch helplessly as the world dies.

Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Lauren Cohan are Batman and The Joker. The world is at war, specifically Aquaman versus Wonder Woman. Everything in the animated movie is what happens in the movie.

People got confused because of the titling, but it was never intended to be one story spanning two films. 

Your original comment - about the film most likely being a mess because they crammed two movies into one - is wrong. It might be a mess for other reasons but they went into production knowing that they were doing one film.

Like, look at Marvel. Iron Man was pretty C-Tier in the public eye before he pretty much instantly became well known by almost everyone.

dkenigma,"1. Since the Fox doesn't have any special abilities, it won't lose anything.  It retains it's speed and changes from ""animal"" to ""construct"".  I'm not sure where you're finding that you add 10hp for a construct bonus.
The features and traits you add for a construct are:
d10 Hit Die.
Base attack bonus equal to total Hit Dice (fast progression).
Skill points equal to 2 + Int modifier (minimum 1) per Hit Die. However, most constructs are mindless and gain no skill points or feats. Constructs do not have any class skills, regardless of their Intelligence scores.
Construct Size Bonus Hit Points Fine — Diminutive — Tiny — Small 10 Medium 20 Large 30 Huge 40 Gargantuan 60 Colossal 80
No Constitution score. Any DCs or other statistics that rely on a Constitution score treat a construct as having a score of 10 (no bonus or penalty).
Low-light vision.
Darkvision 60 feet.
Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, morale effects, patterns, and phantasms).
Immunity to disease, death effects, necromancy effects, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning.
Cannot heal damage on its own, but often can be repaired via exposure to a certain kind of effect (see the creature’s description for details) or through the use of the Craft Construct feat. Constructs can also be healed through spells such as make whole. A construct with the fast healing special quality still benefits from that quality.
Not subject to ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, energy drain, or nonlethal damage.
Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless).
Not at risk of death from massive damage. Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less.
A construct cannot be raised or resurrected.
A construct is hard to destroy, and gains bonus hit points based on size, as shown on the following table.
Proficient with its natural weapons only, unless generally humanoid in form, in which case proficient with any weapon mentioned in its entry.
Proficient with no armor.
Constructs do not breathe, eat, or sleep.

3. It's worth 1hp and counts as a normal meal.

4. Yes, but it has only 20% of it's normal hitpoints, but who cares?  Ride that Candy Cane Horse to glory!

5. Glitterdust, Web,  Web Bolt, Ice slick...all good for battlefield control.

6. Depends on how you want to play and who else is in your party.

7. Create a past story for her.  Think of her goals and what she wants to do in the world.  Think of 3 secrets that she's keeping from everybody.  Think of 3 things she fears.  Then watch every episode of the old Justice League cartoon with Granny Goodness in it.

I just couldn't help but giggle and picture the whole scene as if it was from DBZ. ",dflxb32,t3_628j5e,,4,dbz,,,2017-03-30

MoltenAverage,"Thornton's role, for his entire NHL career, has been to make other players think twice about roughing up his teammates (""legal"" hits, high hits, doesn't matter. Injuries happen in either situation) because of the threat of retribution. Teams pay him to do it, they pay other players to do it, it's no secret. It's how some players have kept their jobs for as long as they have.

That said, to have played against someone like Emelin for as long as he has, to watch a guy lay bone-crushing hits on your teammates time and time again and know that he is effectively immune to the particular brand of justice that you owe your job to... I can understand his frustration.

Thornton has done some shitty things in his career. No question. Most players in his position have. That doesn't mean that Emelin's style of play is exempt from criticism, especially because in a way, it's one-dimensional like Thornton's. Thornton is paid to be scary, Emelin is paid to lay huge hits. Just as players like Thornton are disappearing from the league, I personally have a feeling that players like Emelin will find themselves in a similar position before long.

He cares about you. And so do I. So do some people in your life. 

Life is hard shit. And honestly I think it's harder for those of us who have super villains like poverty, mental illness, absent families or loneliness. It's easy to point at a guy in a green suit who robs banks. 

It's much more difficult when your only sidekick is a cat you have to feed.

snowb0und_,"The canonical answer is ""Earth, and by extension our universe, do not exist within the Magic: The Gathering (tm) Multiverse (tm)."" Period, full stop, any resemblance is purely coincidental. This includes meta-textual connections, i.e. one of the Earth's in Marvel Comic's continuity is ""our"" Earth OR the Justice League episode ""Legends"" which posits that comic books are reflections of the events of a parallel timeline.
    
So, theme-park planes are just coincidentally Not-Greece, Not-Egypt, Not-Japan, Not-Asia, Not-Mesoamerica, and Not-Zdzisław Beksiński Planet. They exist in canon because the marketing and creative want them. And, honestly, this is the best answer. Trying to intertwine some narrative conceit that Amonkhet is based on Bolas visiting ancient Egypt, or, worse, ancient Egypt having visions of Amonkhet is reductive and laced with uncomfortable implications about real-world cultures and people. Sure, those still exist when the ideas are co-opted for fiction, but the level of self-awareness is a better buffer than some overwrought feign at justification.
    
All that said, if you want real-world stuff mixed up with your Magic, I'm not gonna harsh your vibes.

edit: I see your point that the account is unverified and might be someone pretending. I can't think of why someone would pretend to be him since 2009.

And in any case, Zack must have thought that is Jon's real account to notice and reply. Why would Zack make a joke about ""standard WB procedure"" to a random fan instead of a producer? and follow it up by asking ""No?"" to dispute or affirm him. A random fan would not be able to attest to the veracity, but a producer would. The point is, Zack obviously either knows or thinks he is talking to the producer of his film.

Tigertemprr,"Do you want to spend the next decade of your life reading about only a handful of DC characters? If so, you can start back in the 1930's with first appearances. Good luck with those if you haven't already developed an appreciation/taste for older comics. Here's what I recommend instead (which is very searchable since this topic pops up pretty much daily):

Forget about continuity, universes, timelines, etc; it's all very confusing, even to creators/fans. Don’t try to read *everything*, else you'll be wading through decades of mediocre comics for too long. Remember, there are SO MANY other characters, series, and publishers to explore.

First appearances/origins aren’t always good starting points. Creative teams change often and characters get re-worked e.g. never caring about Hawkeye until Fraction &amp; Aja’s interpretation. Focus on well-received and relatively self-contained series. Pick an interesting character or team and seek their “greatest hits” stories. You may still encounter the occasional unexplained reference/character, but it’s best to just ride along or just Wiki if you must.

Alternatively, you can just pick ANY Rebirth title and start reading from #1.

Events/crossovers can be fun and/or tedious. They are most appreciated by readers well-versed in relevant continuity. Generally, the best non-event comics integrate these seamlessly or avoid them entirely (notwithstanding editorial/executive mandates). Regardless, you may want to familiarize with major plot points.

Narokkurai,"&gt; An order signed an executive order establishing the President’s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis.

Right let's start War on Drugs 2.0, because that worked so great the first time.

&gt;An order initiating a review of the Clean Power Plan, which restricted greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants.

Because clearly the only thing holding America coal back was emission regulations. /s

&gt;A revised order suspending the refugee program and entry to the U.S. for travelers from several mostly Muslim countries, in response to objections from courts. As before, the order will suspend refugee entries for 120 days, but doesn't suspend Syrian refugees indefinitely and no longer includes Iraq in the named countries. In signing this order, the original one was revoked.

Neither order is constitutional or necessary. The American immigration system is already one of the strictest in the world, and both orders fail to address several of the largest state supporters of terror in the world.

&gt;An order moving the HBCU (Historically Black College and Universities) offices back from the Department of Education to the White House.

Well, when you nominate a complete incompetent like Betsy DeVos to run the department, this might actually be an improvement.

&gt;An order requiring every agency to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force to evaluate regulations and recommend rules for repeal or modification.

Right, and how much do you want to bet that these task forces aren't full of industry insiders who will rig the system for themselves? Our Sec of State is the former CEO of Exxon Mobil for fuck's sake. 

&gt;Three orders establishing three Department of Justice task forces to fight drug cartels, reduce violent crime and reduce attacks against police.

Even though crime has been on a steady decline for over a decade, and police brutality is becoming an increasingly visible and flagrant issue, Trump wants to make the police even *more* powerful?

&gt;An order directing the Treasury secretary to review the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law.

Great Recession? What's that? Donald's friends have been sad that they can't cheat the market at taxpayer expense, so clearly that has to go.

&gt;A memorandum instructing the Labor Department to delay implementing an Obama rule requiring financial professionals who are giving advice on retirement, and who charge commissions, to put their client's interests first.

So it's literally just ""Fuck Old People"". Okay.

&gt;An order instructing agencies that whenever they introduce a regulation, they must first abolish two others.

Regulations are not the problem, the regulations exist to FIX the problem.

&gt;A memorandum directing the Secretary of Defense to draw up a plan within 30 days to defeat ISIS.

Right, because the solution to tense and complex international crises is to light a fire under your own ass and hope you come up with a good idea in a month.

&gt;An executive order imposing a 120-day suspension of the refugee program and a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. from citizens of seven terror hot spots: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan.

As I said before, this order is both pointless and immoral. Obama's administration put those nations on a watch list, as in, ""We should monitor these nations and be aware of any sudden political or social upheavals"" not ""We should shut down everything and look like colossal asshats in front of the whole world"".

&gt;Two multi-pronged orders on border security and immigration enforcement including: the authorization of a U.S.-Mexico border wall; the stripping of federal grant money to sanctuary cities; hiring 5,000 more Border Patrol agents; ending “catch-and-release” policies for illegal immigrants; and reinstating local and state immigration enforcement partnerships.

All of which ranges from ""unnecessary"" to ""embarrassingly unnecessary"". A border wall will cost billions and accomplish fucking nothing. Stripping funding from sanctuary cities is childish, especially since sanctuary and ""catch-and-release"" policies are crucial for law enforcement to properly police immigrant communities. I *guarantee* that if cities lose their sanctuary status, crime will skyrocket. Guarantee.

&gt;A memorandum calling for a 30-day review of military readiness.

Because you know what we haven't had in a while? A good war. We're all just itching to go to war with someone right?

&gt;Two orders reviving the Keystone XL pipeline and Dakota Access piplines. He also signed three other related orders that would: expedite the environmental permitting process for infrastructure projects related to the pipelines; direct the Commerce Department to streamline the manufacturing permitting process; and give the Commerce Department 180 days to maximize the use of U.S. steel in the pipeline.

An embarrassment. Both pipelines are massive money sinks which present significant environmental dangers, not to mention that both of them are going to end up in Canada, so once construction finishes we're barely going to see a dime from them.

&gt;An order to reinstate the so-called ""Mexico City Policy"" – a ban on federal funds to international groups that perform abortions or lobby to legalize or promote abortion. The policy was instituted in 1984 by President Reagan, but has gone into and out of effect depending on the party in power in the White House.

Cruel, unnecessary. Access to birth control and reproductive rights is one of the most important things for a developing nation. If a woman can't get a proper abortion, she is much more likely to seek dangerous alternative methods, or be left raising a child which she is not prepared to care for properly.

&gt;A notice that the U.S. will begin withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Trump called the order ""a great thing for the American worker.

I'm sure he called it that, but trade deals like TPP and NAFTA play an incredibly important role in streamlining the flow of goods and capital between countries. Without international trade, Americans will have more jobs, but our money won't go anywhere, and it won't grow. We'll just be circulating the same dollars among the same people, while other nations--particularly China--continue to surge ahead.

&gt;An order imposing a hiring freeze for some federal government workers as a way to shrink the size of government. This excludes the military, as Trump noted at the signing.

Because clearly the military is the most important part of a peacetime government. Unless... no, that's silly. Everyone knows that Trump is the ANTI-war candidate.

&gt;An order that directs federal agencies to ease the “regulatory burdens” of ObamaCare. It orders agencies to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement” of ObamaCare that imposes a “fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.”

i.e. gutting and negating the entire purpose of the ACA. Not that Republicans didn't already do that 7 years ago, but apparently Trump just wants to set the American healthcare system on fire so he can blame Obama for it.

Not-Clark-Kent,"Eh, kinda. It's approachable for the most part but refers to history a lot. Hawkman's backstory is the most convoluted of all time because they keep changing it. Can't lie about that, but he's still worth reading. 

There are 2 main versions: Katar Hol, a space cop from the plant Thanagar who eventually joins the Justice League, and Carter Hall, an archeologist who realizes he is a reincarnated Egyptian priest, who joins the first superhero team in the 1940s, the Justice Society. Many confusing and conflicting things besides that happen that we won't get into that involves multiple versions of both Hawkmen. 


Hawkman Vol. 4 (written by Geoff Johns) fixes all the confusion by saying that the reason why there are many Hawkmen and Hawkgirls is because they are eternal lovers who keep reincarnating every time they die. Even the space cop versions is another life of the same 2 people. In the modern Justice Society story ""The Return of Hawkman"", it is revealed that Hawkgirl is an imperfect reincarnation because a girl named Kendra Saunders committed suicide, and clinically died, but then was shocked back, this time, reborn as Hawkgirl, but still thinking she's Kendra because she only kind of died. The conflicting memories make it so she doesn't truly love Hawkman when he comes back to life in that story. I say all that because it's a central conflict in Vol. 4 with Hawkman trying to win her love. 


If this post makes sense to you, Vol. 4 is a good place to start. The most simple place to start is Hawkworld, which is basically Hawkman Year One for the Katar Hol (space cop) Hawkman. ",dfmxg52,t3_62fzvt,,3,DCcomics,,,2017-03-31

Was the Batman/Batgirl pairing in *TKJ* out of place and unnecessary? Absolutely. So was the entire first act with Batgirl, but after that once the real movie starts I think it stays almost slavishly true to the comic, which itself is overrated and is neither a top 5 Batman comic or a top 5 Alan Moore comic.

counta986,"Always great to have someone new join the DC comics universe. Been reading DC ever since i was 8 years old, and now i am 30! DC is huge and varied. You chose a good time to get into comics as Rebirth rebooted all of DC's titles. That doesn't mean that New 52 wouldn't work for you. They are both good starting points, but in my opinion, Justice League started better in the N52 relaunch. So you have two starting points, make your choice. Later on, when you know which characters interest you the most, you can check the sidebar of the subreddit to get recommendations, or you could ask us and we will offer our personal recommendations. One thing you need to note, if you like the magic and dark aspect of DC, you might want to check the Justice League Dark series in the N52 as the regular Justice League title deals only with Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg etc. Anyways, let us know if you need any more help! And enjoy your journey! ",dfmo2w1,t3_62hhdc,,3,DCcomics,,,2017-03-31

Valanga1138,"I agree with the meh, but for different reasons.

In all the CW shows, if there's one thing the showrunners proved other than not getting one character right to save their lives, is not being able to give justice to a comic book storyline. So i'm definitely against adapting stories from the comic, at this point, let them tell their own stories instead.

I mean, Justice League Unlimited and Young Justice had success by getting the characters right but telling original stories, that's what any comic inspired show and movie should aspire",dfn2jc2,t3_62feet,,2,arrow,,,2017-03-31
matito29,"Yes and no. Conroy still voices the character in the show Justice League Action, which is geared towards kids. In the DC animated film universe, Jason O'Mara voices him, and he's objectively terrible.

Thing is the Batfamily spinoffs don't really impact the overarching Justice League arc.  So they can still take place in the periphery of the universe being created.  BUT...how JL is perceived DOES feed into the main JL member solo movies.  ",dfmuglf,t3_62h6qg,,2,DC_Cinematic,,,2017-03-31

AhhBisto,"I can tell you what i've dropped: Suicide Squad, Blue Beetle and Gotham Academy. Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Hellblazer and Batman Beyond are on the edge of being dropped but Batgirl is making some decent strides with the current arc and i want to see the Paul Dini stuff on Harley before i drop it.

My favourite stuff though is all Superman related. The main Superman book is the best, Action Comics, New Super-Man, Superwoman, Supergirl and Super Sons are all excellent too IMO. Detective Comics is a great read, Batman is a little up and down (although more down), All-Star Batman is Snyder at his best and Batwoman has come out of the gates quite well. Batgirl &amp; The Birds of Prey is one of the most underrated titles around IMO, Titans and Teen Titans are a return to greatness for the Titans brand, Red Hood and the Outlaws is a surprisingly good book from the guy who fucked the Titans brand in the first place and Nightwing has been a great character driven book. The Justice League family of books are tight, The Flash is a great read with some excellent artwork, Aquaman does politics and heroism and does it well, Cyborg improves week by week and builds an interesting world for Vic Stone and Wonder Woman has a good Year One story with an albeit frustrating present day story. Both Lantern books are firing on all cylinders, Green Arrow mixes superb artwork with superb story telling and Trinity does the same. Deathstroke is a magic carpet ride into the dangers of the DC universe, and the Justice League is a mixture of the dangers of bad story telling and being too subtle with potential universe defining changes.

Still waiting on that Telos Rebirth tho.",dfnn3yn,t3_62ljyq,,2,DCcomics,,,2017-03-31

SlimeStack,"There's a JSA trade coming out later this year I think for the 1999 series, but other than that it's down to either buying single issues individually or hunting down the older trades that are out of print. Personally I'm buying them all digitally.

If you like bronze age stuff you'll love the three series I mentioned. They all focus on different things. The All-Star Comics series (#58 onwards) continues the original golden age run (#1-57) in the present (late 70s-80s) day with the JSA all aged up and having recruited some younger heroes (Power Girl, Robin, etc). All-Star Squadron takes place during World War II and is pretty much a modern take on the golden age JSA with lots of new characters. Infinity Inc is essentially the JSA teen titans, focusing on the younger heroes (which means less Jay come to think of it).

I haven't gotten too far into JSA 1999 but the first arc was good and the majority of the JSA fanbase comes from this series. It features a mix of the original characters and younger characters much like All-Star Comics but integrated into New Earth (so it exists in the same universe as the Justice League).
