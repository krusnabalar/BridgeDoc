SetYourGoals,"**THIS**

Everyone needs to read this. The only reason these locations have film is that they are the horrible dome IMAXs, which can only take film I believe. It's worse than seeing it in a standard 2D non-IMAX theater. There are specific IMAX dome films that are great, but they were *designed to be shown in a dome.* Don't get tricked. Regualr films are terrible in dome IMAX. 

/u/BTS_1 you did not see Rogue One or TFA in 70MM at CityWalk. It's an IMAX Laser location, but it has the full sized screen, and will essentially be the full IMAX experience we used to call ""70MM."" It's just not on film. But honestly I think the trade off of lower resolution that is barely perceptible is worth it for the brighter projection and less film/screen issues. If you have a full sized IMAX screen near you, 99% chance they are showing the full sized IMAX version of Last Jedi. 

IMAX, for whatever reason, is fucking terrible at informing the public about their product. They've completely destroyed the branding of what IMAX is, and it's crazy that at this point people like us in this thread have to go out and do their PR job for them. It's exhausting to have to do this every time an IMAX movie comes out. I'm frustrated. ",do3rsiq,t3_75414y,,39,movies,,,2017-10-09

Koala_Guru,"I want to say before I tell you this that I'm not trying to be mean, just stating my issues with this review. Tone doesn't convey well in text. I thought that you had a lot of good points, as I think we all can agree the writing wasn't nearly as tongue-in-cheek in the future trilogy. 

So the thing I take great issue with is your thoughts on the added lore. Let's start with Ratchet. One of your biggest complaints was that the charm of his character was that he was a nobody who got drawn into a big conflict, and giving him a history that makes him important ruins that. You also showed a clip from Star Wars to illustrate this. However I think you forgot who Luke is. Yes, Luke started out as a nobody, but later it is revealed that he is much more important than anyone thought. Once Obi Wan and Yoda die, Luke is the last Jedi. Ratchet is the last lombax. Not only that, but Luke is later revealed to be the son of the main villain, and is hinted as being the most powerful force user, or at least having the capacity to be. It's definitely not unheard of for a hero's journey to reveal that their heroes are more important to the grander scope than first let on, and it is definitely not a bad thing to add some backstory to make the universe more deep.

Now about Clank. I think you misinterpreted what the game was saying about Orvus. It wasn't negating his backstory from the first game, it was just supplying added context. You criticize the logic behind many things in this game, so tell me, what is the logic behind Clank being so defective that he looks absolutely nothing like the other robots and has entirely different abilities? The factory still made a defective robot so that it would have valuable information for stopping Drek, but he was never intended to be more than a useful tool for whoever wanted to take him down. It was Orvus' intervention that led to Clank developing a personality and bond with Ratchet, hence why they took special time to show how similar their personalities were. Orvus needed a son and saw an opportunity for one. The reason the Zoni didn't attempt to contact Clank before Tools of Destruction is because there was no need for him since Orvus was still alive.

What I'm trying to say is, there's nothing wrong with adding some depth to characters. It strengthens the ability for storytelling. Reducing characters to their most basic traits is what led to Thieves in Time. ",do3ruiv,t3_753vz5,,10,RatchetAndClank,,,2017-10-09

_This_Is_Stupid,"To start with this: Constructive criticism (i.e. ""If you swap to farming X here instead of there, you achieve goal Y faster, free up resources to pursue your goal Z faster, and get this extra thing too!"") is always appreciated; criticizing my priorities (i.e. ""You should be pursuing this goal unrelated to anything you mentioned!"") isn't--just don't.

So, let's start with the Credit shop:

Gear. That's it. And it's only with credits, unless CG screws up and apologizes with 500 crystals, and then I pick up the Mk III holoprojectors, AKA the Drain of Hope. Last count, I needed 1200 salvage (including fusion furnaces) to complete my characters, and anything that gets me through that faster is fine by me. I'm going to work the Clones in soon here, so that way I can get Princess Zody going. But, realistically, that's a few months out from here.

Cantina Store: Right now, Poe Dameron. Why? Well, I've got him 5 stars, and I can get 1-2 shipments a day. That's 37 days till I 7 star him, and I anticipate a need to have him at 7 stars December-January timeframe. So, getting him ready in advance will save any sort of panic on my part. After this, FOO, since I don't have him 7 star. Then? Well, that's two and a half months from now, or so. I'll figure it out then.

Guild Store: Resistance Trooper, and just now Jyn Erso. RT is 5 star, needs 7 star for aforementioned reason of December/January anticipation, and Jyn is pretty awesome and will help with TB, so there we go. My gear concerns here actually are much lower now that I'm in a good guild, as opposed to my old one, and we raid on a consistent schedule and people participate and follow rules. Good times.

Squad Arena: I'm finishing Cassian Andor right now, but I've got5 shards left, which means tomorrow morning, I finish that farm. That leaves...
Ugnaught or CUP. Entirely for TB purposes. And, yes, to 7 stars. That's just how I've decided to farm characters from now on, and both will take ~70 days to complete. After that? Well, I'll figure it out. Sidious or Savage perhaps, or HK. We'll see what appeals to me then.

Galactic War: K2SO, and Plo-Koon's Jedi Fighter. I don't have it to the level I want it, and I just realized how useful it would be for certain challenges, and perhaps even fleet arena, so that's an investment for me. I happen to really enjoy fleet battles, so I actually get what I want from doing this.

Mod Store: I do not have the credits or crystals to bother with this, so rarely check in and see if there's anything that's even marginally worth it.

Fleet Store: Primarily, I'm doing whatever shows in the lowest left corner if I don't already have it 7 stars--so, TFP, FOTFP, and Clone Sergeant. I'll also pick up blueprints for rare Dark Side ships like Slave I and TIE Advanced. If I have 2k extra, I'll pick up a zeta mat, if it doesn't preclude an opportunity in the upcoming shipments. Given my overall status for these characters, that's ~50 days (there are 4 that rotate approximately equally through there, they're mostly 5 stars, I can pick up 3 shipments from that location a day, so that's how the math works out.)

Guild Events Store: GEAR! Whatever difficult to farm gear that I see is my priority here, provided I have an immediate use for it. This means getting my arena team to G11-12, and improving gear of my Resistance, FO, and Rebels for various purposes. Also, if I see shards of difficult to farm characters, such as Baze, I'll pick them up.

Shard Shop: Whatever gear that I can afford to get that advances my gear goals. There is a literally zero chance I will invest in Grievous at this time, and if I wanted to invest here, I'd do it in the Fleet shop, which I'm not doing.

Cantina Energy: Today/Tomorrow/Saturday: Speed mods, then Critical Chance mods. After that? Old Ben. I took a 5 day break from farming him so I could get a bunch of mods to put on Phoenix for Thrawn, and get a bunch for when CLS comes back. After I 7 star Old Ben, I'm taking a week off to farm mods again, then it will be Finn, then Kylo. After that, I'll be looking at the mod situation, and possibly going after Captain Han then. I recognize at this rate, I'll get ROLO well before Captain Han, which is irony at its finest, but I'm all about getting a solid base.

Normal Energy: Right now, all hard nodes. I'm prioritizing FOST, and otherwise I'm using my energy on nodes that give shards and gear, or Baze/Shoretrooper/Nihilus/Ghost/Phantom II (because of the Chimaera thing--only to 5 stars, then we'll see after that). Other than FOST, I have no major focus here, which is suboptimal here, but I'm in no particular hurry for any of those guys.
So that's my farm. It's how I'm enjoying the game, and putting things that I want in a nice queue. Feel free to share yours!",do3vwro,t3_753uio,,3,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,,,2017-10-09

-Chase,"Well, I can help you with a few of these:

* CtrlP -- Check. I have set a keybind for &lt;ctrl&gt;p to open a fzf-tmux pane that lets me quickly switch files in the project. I've done the same for &lt;user&gt;e to quickly edit files in the directory that I opened kakoune.
* Jedi-vim &amp; vim-go are supported according to the IRC channel
* vim-tmux-navigator -- if you created panes using kakoune (there are built in commands for tmux-new-horizontal/vertical) then there are built in commands to focus said pane. Doesn't work for new tmux windows, though that may be a bug, because the command is there.
* vim-gitgutter -- this works, but I haven't checked how much is implemented in it.
* slimux -- check? I believe all this does is let you send commands to a different tmux pane. That means all it really does is wrap your tmux-keybinding with the command "":set-buffer &lt;text&gt;"" and "":paste-buffer -t 0:1.2"". With kakoune, I have it set so a command "":ide"" will set up my top pane and split it in the bottom pane to allow build commands. If you wanted, you could instead set it up differently. I also know there is a command called ""tmux-repl-horizontal/vertical"" which creates a pane for repl interaction. Perhaps that's what you're looking for?
* Solarized dark colorscheme is available by default, but in need of a small re-vamp. I could do this for you in minutes if you desired. Personally I'm rocking a 256 colorway so I don't get annoyed with mosh :( There are lots and lots of themes available outside the main repo too. For instance base16 themes are mainted by a user for kakoune.

I didn't knoe these last three you mentioned, so I asked the IRC channel. They said nerdtree is replaced by ranger or nnn; Kakoune can compile stuff asynchronously but neomake is a different thing; There is no tagbar.

They also wanted me to share these two links with you:

* kakoune's ecosystem is growing steadily day after day: https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Akakoune&amp;type=Repositories
* other vim plugins to kak migration: https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/wiki/Migrating-from-Vim-popular-plugins (someone said maybe syntastic is relevant for the neomake question)

I hope this helps, and I know the growing pains in switching is hard, so if you have any more questions please feel free to ask! The IRC is #kakoune on freenode",do4i0aa,t3_74n6y2,,3,linux,,,2017-10-09

eliottruelove,"Prediction that would be terrible if true: it was Luke who killed the whole Jedi school in the rain because his interpretation of the path they were headed was they were headed to the dark side, perhaps having had a vision many of them would turn dark and wreak havoc, and Kylo and the Knights of Ren were the last few who survived and held him off. Luke exiles himself due to the horror he had wrought and Kylo and the Knights of Ren are disillusioned as to what the light and dark mean and side with Snoke, who only was slightly involved with them before that. Luke reveals he killed all the padawans and Rey survived and was hidden on Jakku and had her memory wiped.

The First Order is going to take over worlds through sheer militarization.

This is why so many characters in the canon do not mind the Empire for keeping the galaxy in control with an iron fist. But the First Order hasn't colonized anything...right now the galaxy is in chaos. So, the First Order is going to go system-by-system and colonize, and I wouldn't be surprised if they take the approach of ""If you don't let us be here, we blow up your city. Kapeesh?""

-Lego Batman Movie

-Power Rangers

-Wonder Woman

-Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2

-Spider-Man: Homecoming

Power Rangers and Spider-Man are my top 2. I just felt really connected to the characters and both of them left me with a feeling of wanting to spend more time with them. And don't get me going on ""but there wasn't enough fighting in Power Rangers!"" Shut up. I went in expecting garbage. Hell, I didn't even get to see it until the last week it was in theaters. I expected the McDonald's of movies: cheap, flavorless, not the least bit satisfying. I came out never so happy to have been so wrong. Sure, more fighting would have been good, but it didn't need it.

Batman and Wonder Woman are my next two. Not the best movies, but solid for what they were.

Guardians was probably the weakest of the 5, but still enjoyable.

I'm preemptively going to put The Disaster Artist and The Last Jedi at the top of my list and Saw 8 at the bottom (I've seen all of them multiple times and own them on DVD, admittedly since it's heyday I will say the quality diminished significantly after 3, but I'll give 8 a fair chance).

SetYourGoals,"**THIS**

Everyone needs to read this. The only reason these locations have film is that they are the horrible dome IMAXs, which can only take film I believe. It's worse than seeing it in a standard 2D non-IMAX theater. There are specific IMAX dome films that are great, but they were *designed to be shown in a dome.* Don't get tricked. Regualr films are terrible in dome IMAX. 

/u/]BTS_1 you did not see Rogue One or TFA in 70MM at CityWalk. It's an IMAX Laser location, but it has the full sized screen, and will essentially be the full IMAX experience we used to call ""70MM."" It's just not on film. But honestly I think the trade off of lower resolution that is barely perceptible is worth it for the brighter projection and less film/screen issues. If you have a full sized IMAX screen near you, 99% chance they are showing the full sized IMAX version of Last Jedi. 

IMAX, for whatever reason, is fucking terrible at informing the public about their product. They've completely destroyed the branding of what IMAX is, and it's crazy that at this point people like us in this thread have to go out and do their PR job for them. It's exhausting to have to do this every time an IMAX movie comes out. I'm frustrated.

TYBERIUS_777,"I actually just watched a theory that said he could potentially be an ancient sith that was awakened during the Galactic Civil War. There were some sith with some ridiculously overpowered abilities back in the Old Republic days. The one that this video focused on was Darth Nihilus who could drain the life from a fellow force user to sustain himself (something along those lines. Basically he could drain their living force). 

This would actually make a lot of sense because if you look at the trailer Snoke seems to be in better shape than in the last movie. He could have drained force sensitives in between movies. This could also explain why he was so interested in Rey. Someone more powerful than Kylo Ren would certainly sustain him for quite a while. Or it could just be that Snoke is like Palps where he just wants to replace his apprentice with a more powerful one (RIP Dooku). 

Also the scene at the end of the trailer where he was doing something to Rey using the force looked awfully painful and different than any Force tricks we have seen before. Could be the life drain in action. It could also be why Snoke is so interested in finding Luke. Luke was the most powerful Jedi in his time. He would probably restore Snoke to full Old Republic sith power. This could also explain why Kylo can use force abilities that we have never or rarely seen before in Star Wars. The mind reading thing he does is a form of Jedi mind tricking seen in one episode of the Clone Wars (Anakin, Windu, and Kenobi attempt to force the bounty hunter Cad Bane to reveal a location and they almost break his mind in the process). For Kylo to be able to do something solo that 2 Jedi masters and a Jedi knight could not do could be because Snoke knows some ancient sith secrets and abilities that he has shared with Kylo. Also we've never seen anyone stop a blaster bolt mid air either. Could be another Old Republic sith trick. 

All in all I think this theory if correct would be very interesting. It would open up the idea of the crazier sith powers that only now exist in the extended universe and would make Snoke a much more threatening villain. Right now he's very mysterious and I can't really picture his motives or how powerful he is. (Beating Rey isn't that big of a win.

Kylo Ren on the other hand is an angsty, petulant, incompetent teenager. His only purpose in the movies seems to be so you have someone to hate, and Ren fills that purpose well. They've written him so lazily and so lousy it's a shame. The whole ""evil Nazi empire"" ""incompetent but still promoted beyond their competence white male"" shtick is a bit forced IMO. 

The old movies were a simple tale of good against evil, but did explore the parts in between black and white. The meaning of friendship, the meaning of family. That there is hope, there is redemption. The biggest crime the prequels committed was that they got lost in details. They forgot that this was ultimately the story of how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. Lucas got lost with so many subplots that the overall transistion from Anakin to Vader was just one of many confusing little things overall.

My issue with the new movie (haven't seen the Last Jedi yet) is that it's a Mass Effect: Andromeda situation. We have a company that recognises a brand and wants to milk it as hard as possible. So they try to recreate the original spirit but in a modern way. And in the process of making it modern and fresh they completely forget to include the things that made the original series so endearing and popular in the first place.

When I first saw this in Google Images (searching for the Paige card and the info on the back), I thought this was just an AT-M6 that looked different because of the angle, but nope. This card has been available for a while, so I'm surprised I haven't seen it outside of Topps-related stuff. However, the same picture was just used on [*The Last Jedi*'s new poster](https://s19.postimg.org/awmp1gwwx/The_Last_Jedi_Theatrical_Poster.jpg).

For comparison, [here](https://s19.postimg.org/ofyxtct75/AT-_AT_DICE.png)'s the AT-AT from *Battlefront*. There are actually some differences, so maybe the First Order's not reusing old Galactic Empire vehicles (or they've just been refitted). I wonder if [the AT-STs they seem to be using](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/72knk8/first_order_still_using_classic_atsts/) are going to be slightly different too. Those are also represented with [this toy](https://s19.postimg.org/c40mthcox/52122953_Alt01.png), which is actually a new mold and not just a rerelease of one of the two older *Galactic Heroes* Imperial AT-STs: [1](https://s19.postimg.org/dvtlof6ch/s-l1600_1.jpg) and [2](https://s19.postimg.org/dj27i7lhv/s-l1600_2.jpg).

Also, I found [a poster](https://trendsinternational.com/event/featured-star-wars-the-last-jedi/rp15538.html) with [the leaked AT-M6 blueprint art](https://www.facebook.com/temploaztlan/posts/807374266077964) that points out the walker's ""Deflector Shield Generator"" and ""Wall Buster Gauntlet"", so I guess the latter will be used to help destroy the Rebel base.

A liberal millennial, Horny Permavirgin, like his peers, sought the destruction of civilization as they knew it.

The last bit where Kylo is reaching his hand out is made to look like he’s reaching out to Rey... Misdirection. Kind of. It’s part of the flash back, and he is reaching out for Rey, but a child hood Rey. 

The destruction of the Jedi temple wasn’t Kylo’s doing, it was Rey. I’m thinking she had some force freak out, and somehow blew up the temple... And that Kylo was the one who took her to Jakku. 

When Kylo says “let the past die,” he’s telling Rey to let go of remorse over destroying the Jedi Temple. 

And the scene where it looks like Rey is getting tortured is actually her having another force meltdown. The shot beforehand with Snoke reaching out is probably not in the same moment, but it’s clipped together to make it look like it.

Phoenix will give you two Jedi to help toward GMYoda, with Old Ben being the third for that line-up ... especially as you need OB for CLS. With your five Rebel Phoenix you can unlock Palps and Thrawn needed for R2. For the last three empire you should focus on TFP (ships cross-over benefit), RG (east farm and the empire lacks easily attainable tanks, and Tarkin (also needed for ships). If your Vader is in a good spot, he’s a great replacement for RG. You’ll need to farm St. Hans and Leia from the arena store. You also now have a decent start to several Hancor teams (zVader/empire team, CLS when he returns). Don’t neglect Farmboy Luke,  he’s theist piece of the puzzle needed for CLS. CLS solos Rancor when you have him. Scoundrels don’t really have a character they unlock, but they should be one of the first teams farmed for the credit heist—Lando, St. Hans, Raid Han when you have him, Boba (another one needed for ships) + one other Scoundrel, doesn’t matter which, they are all mediocre, though Greedo at the GW shop might be the easiest.BB8 will return in about three/four months, so don’t forget FO for him, and bonus zKylo is great for hAAT, and FOTP is an amazing ship you’ll want.

PM_ME_GLUTE_SPREAD,"Honestly, I'd be surprised if it wasn't just a bait and switch for the movie and the producer(?)'s tweet just a hype grab.

There is no way Disney doesn't see the backlash that could come from having a female lead Jedi in the movies turn evil. They wouldn't roll over but they would definitely piss off a sizable portion of fans. Is that right to be pissed about? That's another discussion.

From what I've seen of the trailers and from the older movies, I think Rey will be having her ""cave"" moment like Luke had. But instead of pulling out her saber and going all order 66, she'll reason with Kylo instead, easing any nervousness that Luke has about her in regards to her strength. 

Snoke will end up being exactly how he looks (being Mace Windu or the youngling or any other theory is just too far out there to be considered), Poe and company will suffer a harsh defeat at the hands of the first order and seem like they are finished but will be saved at the last minute and escape at the last minute to lick wounds. 

Rey will leave the island, likely with Luke in tow and go to confront Kylo in ep 9 where Kylo may or may not kill Luke. Rey, instead of getting revenge and Killy Kylo after winning the upper hand in a duel will drop her saber and forgive Kylo. Snoke will order Kylo to kill Rey (*do it*), which he'll have hang ups about and eventually turn on Snoke and return to the light side of the force.

They had to appease the disenfranchised original trilogy lovers so they went with a nostalgic recipe they knew would work.

I think ""the last Jedi"" is meant to be him, like he was in the OT. And now he wants to keep it that way by not training Rey.

Meanwhile The Force Awakens, even with those stunning visuals and some dramatic moments, can't seem to escape the shadow of Original Trilogy, with most of the movie is just a compressed rehash of ANH, ESB, and RoTJ.",do6abu7,t3_75df9a,,11,Cyberpunk,,,2017-10-10

BrotherShamrock,"Without having read any of the new books (or rewatched The Force Awakens to see what is wrong with this theory), this is my""The Last Jedi"" theory, that kind of explains Luke coming up out of rubble like that. Sorry, several points ahead:
1. Kylo Ren and Rey are somehow related - not familial relation, but they or their ""families"" have history. 
2. Additionally, Kylo is not actually evil - he is a deep cover operative for The Resistance. Luke Skywalker actually fell to the Dark Side and was Snoke's apprentice. When Kylo realizes this (and realized he was being groomed as Luke's Sith apprentice so that the two of them might overthrow Snoke together), he fights back and leads the other Jedi trainees against Luke as The Knights of Ren (perhaps a name derived from Jedi lore). All the other Jedi are slaughtered by Luke (Anakin-turned-Vader style), Kylo beats the hell out of Luke in Sith fashion, and frames him up so he has to go into exile to hide from Snoke/find some ancient Force secrets to turn the tide in his favor. Kylo takes up as Snoke's apprentice to help defeat the First Order from within. 
3. Snoke has been searching for Rey to find a stronger Force user to corrupt to an apprentice and kill Kylo (a la Anikin/Count Dooku); Kylo has been searching for Rey to take her on as his secret Jedi apprentice to help him with the coming confrontation with Snoke and Luke.
4. Kylo is having his own difficult time with all the horrible stuff he has to do to prove to Snoke he's the real deal; his affinity for Vader is rooted in the fact that Vader did many horrible things but was able to redeem himself in the end by killing the Emperor, and Kylo is trying to hold on to that to justify all he's done.
5. When Kylo discards his mask, he is dropping the ruse as Sith apprentice Kylo Ren and revealing his true aims as Ben Solo, Jedi Knight, and making his allegiance to the Resistance clear. 
6. Luke has been trying to get to Rey subtly through Force visions so that he can take another Sith apprentice to destroy Snoke and Kylo.
7. Rey is caught in the middle of it all and has to figure out what is really going on.

TL;DR - Kylo is actually the good guy, and Snoke and Luke are both Sith trying to gain supremacy over each other. Rey is just caught in the middle of the three. ",do60p5t,t3_75erlj,,10,starwarsspeculation,,,2017-10-10

pieceoftheuniverse,"Not much. It was always going to be a battle of attrition.

The planetary shield just buys the Alliance more time. The rebellion has to move, because the Empire can just bring more resources to bear. Eventually, Hoth is overrun, and the rebellion is wiped out.

There is no winning the battle of Hoth. It's just a matter of how much time they can buy to get everyone away.

Approaching the spirit of the question: what if the Empire never even finds the rebel outpost? The Imperial probe gets waylaid, or Hoth somehow gets overlooked?

Remember that Vader is obsessed with finding Luke and the Millennium Falcon. No matter what happens in the search, his next step is always going to be to hire bounty hunters. He'd prefer to do that with a more solid lead, but it's always on his list.

This ends up worse for Han Solo, who was going to leave Hoth anyway to pay off Jabba. Boba Fett (or some other capable bounty hunter) would naturally start off with known contacts and people to whom he owes debts. If Han suddenly pays off his long-outstanding debt, word is going to get around, and he's not going to have Leia (who's busy managing the resistance) or Lando (who doesn't even get a mention in this new story) to help him out. He gets captured for sure.

Luke still gets his training interrupted. Maybe Leia feels a disturbance in the Force as well, but for her it's more of an uncertain dread. They both head out (independently, and without much help, because that seems to be the Skywalker way) towards the trap that Vader has set.

Because of course there's a trap. It's never been about revenge for the defeat at the Battle of Yavin. It's about reconnecting with his son, Luke Skywalker. The trick is: does Vader recognize his daughter, as well? He didn't when she was right in front of him in orbit of Tatooine. He didn't on Bespin. She probably just gets tortured to ensure Luke falls into the trap.

The trap would be different, too. No merciful carbonite freezing for our hero. The quick and easy method would be to lop off both of Luke's hands, much as Vader did to Dooku back in the day. Then Luke gets taken in as a prize for the Emperor to break, a whole movie early.

Luke doesn't have the time necessary to come to grips with the fact that Vader is his father, nor does he have time to sense the good in him, nor to try to draw it out. Vader watches, coldly, as the Emperor breaks his son in front of him. He watches, dispassionately, as Luke, the new Sith Lord, kills him, and in his last moments, he feels like he probably deserves it.

Leia and Han make it out, by the skin of their teeth. Obi Wan and Yoda have to scramble to come up with some way to get Leia to Dagoba before Yoda dies, but fortunately, the Force loves coincidences. Obi Wan can give her a vision in a dream, or she can scout out a new location for a rebel base, or a number of various things to get her to Yoda so she can start her training.

Training to kill her brother.

*Return of the Jedi* works out pretty much the same way, just with a couple of roles changed. Leia's training kinda sorta complete (she's probably going to be better about that than her brother - being raised as royalty had to give her some notion of responsibility), she joins Han to take down Death Star II. She's critical in making contact with the Ewoks, and that's basically unchanged. Afterwards, she turns herself in to the Imperial forces so that she can see if there's any good left in her brother. Luke takes her up to see the Emperor, yada yada, Emperor dead, Luke gravely injured, fireworks over Endor.",do5kasv,t3_75e4el,,9,AskScienceFiction,,,2017-10-10

sirpsychosexy94,"[x-post from r/StarWars]

It seems that Episode VIII is going to develop the relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren more in-depth than Ep. VII. I think a good endpoint for the narrative of the Last Jedi would be the revelation that the prophecy of the Chosen One, which was once misread as applying to Anakin, and which is seemingly fulfilled by Luke at the end of Ep. VI, actually refers to either Rey, Ren, or both. The transformation of Anakin into Vader and the rise of the Empire signify a tilt of the Force towards the Dark Side, while Luke's ascension into a Jedi Knight and the victory of the Rebellion represent a tilt of the Force towards the Light. It could very well be that the role of Rey (the paragon of the Light Side) and Ren (the paragon of the Dark Side) in this trilogy will be to finally bring the Force into Balance together.
TL;DR Anakin turning into Vader/Rise of Empire = Tilt of Balance towards Dark Side. Luke turning into Jedi/Victory of Rebellion = Tilt towards Light. Rey/Ren = mixture of Light/Dark to bring Balance to the Force",do6j5u8,t3_75danr,,9,starwarsspeculation,,,2017-10-10

MsPenguinette,"According to this interview, they accounted for that by making them larger and have a much more stable stance. 

http://www.starwars.com/news/inside-two-deadly-new-first-order-vehicles-from-the-last-jedi

&gt;One of the questions that tied us up a lot is the fact that they’d been taken down by snowspeeders in The Empire Strikes Back, and it felt like everyone else is trying to avoid the problem of a four-legged version of a walker because they had been defeated on Hoth. So I sort of took that on board and I suggested to Rian, “Well, instead of a dog, what about a gorilla?” I can’t remember why I said a gorilla, but I just said, “They have a great stance, they are very aggressive,” and that’s how the idea of the gorilla came. And literally in profile, I molded it over an actual photo of a gorilla to get the initial base pose.

...

&gt; And again, that’s my take on, “You can’t take these down with a snowspeeder.” They’ve armored up the front or maybe they just cut the ropes because they are too big now. Also, the way they are balanced now is like a gorilla, because their knuckles are turned backwards and they’ve got very high shoulders. They are a completely different poise. Maybe they could even sort of kneel down or something. So I just took that gorilla design iteration, with the very high back, and just went to town with it. 

...

&gt; Well, it was more of a thought process of trying to base the design not upon something random but to move it forward. That’s also the reason for adding the large guns on there. It’s become the heavy assault walker. Also, I really love the idea of going, “What if the old walkers become the scouts for these walkers?” Because these are literally about a third or twice the size of them. So in the artwork, in the designs I initially did, I always put not scout walkers, but the actual classic walkers next to them, which sort of showed off their size. I think I called them goliaths for a while or something, but that’s how they got to where they were.

Also worth noting that their legs bend the way they do so they can brace for shooting the big gun they have on their back. ",do8la8p,t3_75pnlf,,35,StarWars,,,2017-10-11

TomTPT,"&gt;The problem with admitting the Jedi Order was flawed (beyond TCW), is that the entirety of Luke's arc in the OT would be deeply affected. 

I have to disagree, the OT was all about the Jedi Order being flawed. The remnants of the Jedi Order - Ben and Yoda - are repeatedly shown to be wrong (once you start down the dark path, that's it, you will never come back - except both Luke and Vader are counter-examples; Luke shouldn't save his friends but should focus on the bigger metaphysical picture - wrong again, going off to save his friends is exactly what he should have done, it's the right thing to do). 

Luke always represented a break from the old Jedi Order, not only by defying the dogma of the past, but also by marrying together the other-worldness, the mystical, the awesomeness of the Force and the Jedi, with the grounded, of-this-world, mortal and human side of him as a person. 

The old Order distanced itself from the world, Luke refused to do that.

This is what's so interesting about where The Last Jedi could go - the next part of the hero's journey is to return to the village where it all started, like Prometheus bringing fire from the gods to mortals, the hero brings what they have learnt from their journey back to their home. That integration usually goes wrong in some way and the hero becomes an outcast...an exile, either self imposed or otherwise.

How Luke returns to the world could be really interesting, and especially how from his new vantage he attempts to break the cycle of the eternal fight between good and evil.

-Mountain-King-,"Maybe I can help you see the concept better.

Imagine the force as a river. Using the light side is building a windmill. You harness the power of the force without changing it's flow. The force does as it wills.  
Using the dark side, however, is building a dam. It can give you a lot more power, yes - but at a cost. And that cost is that you're changing the flow of the river. The force is warped and twisted by the dark side, its will is corrupted.  
Even a single dark sider thus unbalances the force, while you can many people properly using the light side without unbalancing it.  
To use the classic see-saw metaphor, don't think of jedi at one end and sith at the other. Sith are at one side, yes, but a jedi is supposed to be in the middle. A balancing force on the universe, that doesn't influence things except to enforce the will of the force.

Now, the old jedi order wasn't doing this properly. That's why I think Anakin wiped them out as part of his journey - it needed to be eliminated because, like dark siders, they were no longer using the force for the sake of the force's will and the universe's good. They were servants of the republic, not the force. They weren't in the middle of the see-saw anymore, their windmill was starting to turn into a damn.

The original saga, in my view, tells how Anakin tears down the structures of the old jedi order and then destroys the sith. The only remaining force user is Luke, who wasn't trained in the order and listens to the will of the force (as shown by him disregarding the advice of Yoda, last remnant of that order, and trusting in his force vision instead).

iwannadieonearth,"It was simple and entertaining but it had its moments as well that made it a step above. For example as I've gotten older I've grown to really appreciate the scene at the end of RotJ when Luke declares himself a Jedi to Palpatine.

It's the last stand of the rebellion, big space battle going on outside of this massive station where Luke engages Vader and strikes his father down in single combat. Palpatine encourages Luke to finish the job and Luke just throws aside his weapon instead, declaring himself as a Jedi like his father before him just as an extra fuck you with the assertion and what does Palpatine do? 

He doesn't mock Luke or just go on being his jovial self enjoying this charade, his face becomes sullen and his expression dark, and with the utterance of ""So be it, Jedi"" he recognizes Luke's claim and now it's on. Like there's few moments in movie history where I've felt it's more on than when Ian McDiarmid delivers that line. 

The whole sequence from Luke coming up to the throne room to Vader throwing Palpy down the shaft is tame by today's standards of blockbuster movie final fights but the whole reemergence of the Jedi during the scene and how thematic it is as opposed to being flashy and action packed is great.

Quenadian,"Balance is achieved with the end of dogmatism.

Both Jedi and Sith were dogmatic institutions that needed to end for balance to be achieved. They both had institutional rules that were inhumane. On the Jedi side best exemplified by their complete mismanagement of Anakin's struggle.

Luke rejects the jedi dogma that he must let his friends suffer, commit patricide, that there is no return from the dark side.

Luke is a balanced force user, operating from inner humane motivations instead of rigid external dogmatic rules.

Vader/Anakin brings balance by killing the Emperor and himself, thus removing the last remaining dogmatric force users and ending the Sith institution.

What would make the most sense for the Sequel trilogy is that Luke was oblivious to his transcendance of Jedi dogma and reverted to their ancient dictate for his new Jedi order and unsurprisingly completely fucked it up with Ben Solo, Throwing the force out of balance once more....

Luke is right in the trailer, the Jedi must end...

I'd also like to point out in all the trailer for TFA we didn't know Rey was the Jedi, they only ever showed Finn with the lightsaber. It's kinda the goal of a trailer, misdirect everyone so they're more suprised. 

It's also not Disney's decision on how trailers are cut, it's the director and then LucasArts approves it. The director (I think) tweeted out not to watch the trailer because he thought it was a cut where it appears Rey kills Luke. It's all about editing. ",do7ppd1,t3_75kaw7,,9,DaisyRidley,,,2017-10-11

maveric710,"""He was our last hope.""
""No. There is another.""

Luke is the last Jedi when Leia is killed. And when she is killed, Luke goes on a revenge spree (killing Snoke and taking over the First Order). Think about it, Leia was the only person that Vader successfully used to get under Luke's skin (and rage out on him). Leia dies, Luke loses it (Anakin shows up in ghost form to dissuade Luke).  The Last Jedi now turns to the Dark Side, leaving the Jedi completely extinct (no one is a full fledged Jedi due to lack of training/affiliation). Rey leaves Luke after his switch, prompting Kylo (through a redemption arc since they killed mommy) and Rey to team up.

Kylo (who is 9/10th Jedi) trains Rey, who is extremely powerful, to take on Emperor Skywalker in Act IX. Luke and Kylo die at the end of XI, ending the Skywalker Saga. Rey gets thrown down an exhaust port for good measure.",do76798,t3_75hzw0,,8,StarWars,,,2017-10-11

&gt; Vanity Fair: So, do we know what the words The Last Jedi allude to?

&gt; Kathleen Kennedy: Why in the world do you think I would tell you that?

&gt;I’ll tell you why. Back in 1998, I interviewed George Lucas for V.F. ahead of The Phantom Menace, and I asked, “Who or what is the phantom menace?” And he nonchalantly said, “Oh, it’s Darth Sidious.”

It's a joke about what Lucas did. Both of the people in the article did in fact refuse to say who the Last Jedi is/are.

muckrucker,"My thoughts on Luke's storyline.

Jedi Temple:

* Luke starts training Force users and quickly realizes he's not strong enough to mentor that many at the same time but he soldiers on and does his best
* A couple of ""misfit Jedi"" emerge with much stronger than average power but with way weaker than expected control lead by the future Darth Temper Tantrum
* He has a showdown with Darth Temper Tantrum (and the rest of Team Rocket/Slytherin) that ends with the Temple being disbanded/destroyed/etc
* Luke's wife is killed in the ensuing battle/destruction
* He only spares Darth Temper Tantrum's life because of his parents and ships him back like a trouble maker from summer camp

Going into Exile:

* Recognizing that there's still a Sith force somewhere in the universe, Luke one-ups Obi-wan in his disappearance skills
* Luke leaves Rey (his daughter, imo) on a desert planet to largely fend for herself and to hide her from the remnants of the Empire, the mysterious Sith force out there, and himself
* Luke goes to the most remote place he can find to commune with the Force as a Jedi Monk - preparing himself for the day another Force user finds him again

Training Rey:

* Rey's power is completely on-par (or greater) with Anakin's (pre-higher ground moment)
* Luke attempts to train her to fully understand the balance to the Force, the give-and-take it requires, the service-for-everyone attitude that goes with it; Rey's only focus is stopping Darth Temper Tantrum and whomever she perceives as ""the baddies""
* They have an all-out ""sparring session"" that ends with Luke at the end of her/his light saber confessing she's his daughter and he was only trying to save her from the Force itself
* She huffs off, hurt and confused about everything in life (aka a teenager), until seeking out and eventually joining forces with Darth Temper Tantrum

My thoughts on Darth Temper Tantrum.

Space Combat:

* He gets past the defenses and blows his mother up on the command deck of her ship
* She ""Jedi-haunts"" him right at the end - either as the Jedi spirit/blue ghost or with some simple telepathy - and flips the switch making him realize the evil that's consuming/consumed him so far
* He flies away as the full gravity of her words hit him and realizes he murdered both of his parents in cold blood
* He vows to change and use his anger for good

Deep Reflection:

* Self-inflicted isolation in a not so hidden a corner of the galaxy ensues
* Rey manages to track him down
* He, realizing that Snoke was the dark force acting on him all along, informs Rey of Snoke's existence
* Rey, realizing that Luke was the light force acting on her all along, recounts the ""Weekend at Dad's House"" moments and informs him of Luke's existence
* They team up to go bring down the last Sith Lord and attempt to bring balance to the force

My thoughts on Snoke:

* He's Palpatine after taking a face full of Force Lightning, a nasty fall down an endless air duct/shaft, and surviving the Death Star explosion

* My thoughts are based on the Rule of Two and Vader and The Emperor both appearing to die in Episode VI; we know Vader is dead-dead as he shows up in Jedi ghost form but The Emperor could very easily just get the soap-opera treatment as we never saw the body.

* He physically stays close to everyone (to search/manipulate their feelings) but uses the hologram as a form of protection - his last apprentice, afterall, did ""kill him"" and leave him for dead

* The physical distance is necessary as he's become very frail in physical strength but exceptionally powerful in mental strength - not unlike Yoda towards his end.",do82u47,t3_75mjiw,,7,FanTheories,,,2017-10-11

secondcityrocker,"Some Legends books that stick out in my memory (and not in a good way):

Courtship of Princess Leia- The New Republic tries to put Leia in an arranged marriage with the prince of some planet so Han Solo kidnaps her. Luke and the Prince go find them, then everyone teams up to fight Imperial Admiral who went out on his own #652. They defeat him, then everyone realizes the arranged marriage thing was a mistake and Leia marries Han instead. It's as cheesy as you'd expect.

Children of the Jedi-Luke gets trapped aboard one of the many lost Imperial super weapons that the Emperor apparently just had lying around. He teams up with the spirit of a Jedi that is possessing the weapon to stop it. Luke ends up falling in love with her, and she takes over the body of one of his students that got killed off earlier. It always weirded me out how Luke didn't seem too bothered by that last part.

Truce at Bakura: On the day after the Battle of Endor, the gang goes to some random Imperial-controlled planet to help the local Imperial forces fight off a race of lizard aliens from outside of the galaxy. The Imperials teaming up with Rebels to fight off a greater threat idea had potential, but the lizards power their technology with batteries that were made by draining the life force (not THE force though) of their prisoners, which makes it extra cheesy.

The New Jedi Order: I only read a couple of these since I couldn't get into these because the Vong are like something a 12 year old would come up with: aliens from outside of the galaxy who are immune to the force, destroy planets like it's nothing, worship pain, and look like rejected GWAR characters.

* Ahsoka
* Fives
* Vader
* Biggs

If my TFP is faster than the other team, it works better, but it still works pretty well. Generally, TFP will target lock, other team TIE(s) will hit me (before or after my TIE), and if they target locked me, Ahsoka will dispel the taunt on their Biggs. Then my Fives will target lock someone (usually their FOTP because he's already gone and Fives won't give him enough turn meter to go again). Then my Vader will target lock someone (usually TFP because Vader can't be evaded). If all goes in my favor, I've got target lock on their Vader, TFP, and FOTP, and their Biggs may or may not be taunting.

If Biggs has survived the blow-back this far, he can use his special on one of the target-locked enemies and call an assist (if not, I use his basic to try for a crit to get another target lock). Then it's Mace's turn to use his special and kick things into high gear with lots of damage, turn meter fed back to Mace by Valor buffs, and so on.

If they don't have enough firepower to blow my Biggs away, I will win in less than 2 minutes without needing reinforcements. This sequence can get a little upset if they have a fast Fives who targets one of my people and gets him to go earlier than normal, but it's usually not a big deal. If they target my Vader and I miss target lock on my first few attempts, I'll probably lose if they kill Vader too quickly. But it's pretty reliable.

Usually Biggs is the first to go because I keep him taunting. If they do kill Biggs, my normal reinforcement is...

TIP #2: Use Maul's special on TFP.

I love this so much. TFP almost always survives through to the first reinforcement because I have a taunting Biggs and TFP has stupid high evasion bonus. So in comes Maul, puts his special on TFP, and now I've got a high-evasion, foresight-gaining, counter-attacking TFP with a 70% chance to apply target lock. Also, if he dodges, he feeds a little turn meter to my capital ship.

This tactic is often strong enough to regain me the advantage if my Biggs went down too fast, or to crush the opponent by spamming Mace's special on a bunch of enemies who keep getting target locked over and over by attacking my TFP. There are two counters to this tactic: dispel TFP's retribution (Vader, Fives, Ahsoka can do this, and probably a few rarer ships I can't think of right now), or blow TFP away. This is trickier, but FOTP, Poe, Wedge, Jedi Consular can pull it off. I guess Sun Fac could also stun him, but I rarely see that in practice (and I think TFP can dodge that move).

TIP #3: Use AoE from your reinforcements.

This is a pretty well-known tip and works extra well with an Ackbar lead giving Advantage to your reinforcements. I keep Fett as a reinforcement because he has a great AoE that works well against a bunch of target-locked enemies. He's usually my last reinforcement if I need him. This also works for Fives and probably for Ghost and Millenium Falcon.",do7mgf3,t3_75lclb,,2,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,,,2017-10-11

FearAngerHateSuffer,"It depends on what you would consider ""major"". We don't have a script or even a plot outline if that's what you are looking for. That being said, there have been a number of reliable leaks. One that we are continuing to find out to be accurate comes from u/bothan-spy: 

&gt; [For Episode 8 we all know that Finn still wears poe's jacket thanks to the set photos from earlier this month. What you may not know is the areas damaged during his duel with Kylo have been stapled back together (the red patch on his right shoulder and the slash across his back). The staples are weirdly-shaped, they're not like traditional real-world/fabric or office staples. They are uniquely ""Star Wars"", sort of hedron/diamond-shaped.
Stormtroopers will also have a new type of gun that ""stuns"" it's targets instead of injuring/killing them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/4ejwc1/minor_info_on_finns_appearance_episode_8/)

&gt; [The only mention we have of Luke's fate in TFA is a throwaway line from Han Solo about Luke seeking out the first Jedi temple. My source has revealed that Luke appears to have found it. I am not sure if it lies on Ach-To but the set they have been erecting at Ceann Sibel in Kerry, Ireland is supposed to represent it's location. That set seems to have been built to mimic the ruins at Skellig Michael but again, I do NOT know if the Kerry structures are intended to represent the exact same area where Rey found Luke, or even the same planet. My source did not explicitly say it was on Ach-To and I prefer to just state what I am told, not how I interpret it. But the Kerry site is apparently the location of the first Jedi temple.
I am sure right now most of you are thinking that is kind of a lame spoiler. I mean it was 50/50 that Luke would have had already found it by the time Rey finds him, so for some of us this isn't exactly an earth-shattering reveal.
Well, while we are on the subject, a prominent member of the First Order will also locate this sacred site, leading to a fiery confrontation to say the least...](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/4eydwa/people_that_knew_him_best_think_he_went_looking/)

&gt; [I also mentioned a certain member of the First Order winds up at this location in EpVIII as well. That individual is Kylo Ren.
Here's the saucy bit: A few weeks ago they blew up-- specifically, blew apart-- an Ahch-To hut. According to my source, Kylo and Rey have a conversation that Luke does not like. Luke tries to stop them. Luke gets angry... and the whole hut they are in disintegrates (re: 'blows up'). My source did not specify as to the exact cause of the disintegration, but based on the info I believe Luke accidentally (or perhaps even purposely) does so using the Force.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/4h9l7d/regarding_lukes_explosive_temper_ep8/)

&gt; [This leak concerns what I like to call the ""Skywalker Special"". Specifically, the severing of a limb (and even more specifically, the severing of an arm). I know of at least one character who will be receiving this iconic injury in Episode 8. Don't read any further if you don't want to be spoiled.
That character in question is Captain Phasma. Yes, that's right, good ol' Gwennie. Now this is a fairly recent, ""on-set"" change, as apparently she was just supposed to have something happen to her blaster and not her. But I am told they decided to replace that with a full-blown amputation. Her arm will be... the word used was ""cut"", but I do not believe that is very accurate in all honesty. This injury is inflicted by another main character. At the risk of speculating (or revealing too much), it is done in anger. And it is not the worst that happens to her in Episode 8, either (can't go into more detail about that just yet). Also, let me specify before it gets said below, while I know THIS particular character loses a limb, that does not mean she is the ONLY character who loses a limb.
Okay, so personal conjecture here... Frankly I am surprised Kathleen was okay with what will happen to her 'pet villain' after her public statements last year. Especially after specifically having her survive her ignoble trash chute fate off-screen in EpVII. I have a sneaking suspicion things may change again, as what I have been told happened seems almost like a wasted opportunity. But again, that is TOTALLY speculation and gut-feeling there. I believe it is going to come down to how well-executed it is in the final film. In Rian We Trust and all that.
If more info is desired in the future, you all can pick the topic of the next post in the comments: a) interesting tidbit concerning ""the tree"" at Longcross (when i say tidbit i mean tidbit, its not much at all but it is interesting altho it could also just have been poorly worded) b) info about a returning popular weapon c) interesting info about a scene on a new planet/terrain (haven't seen it anywhere else yet) d) info on who helps Phasma out with her Impromptu Weight Loss Program](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/4l1o6c/the_skywalker_special_epviii_spoilers/)

&gt; [About two months ago, scenes were filmed that involved ""trenches"" on a ""rebel planet"". I have no idea if they mean trenches in the traditional, ground warfare sense or a big trench like on the DS1, although based on timing and context I am thinking it is the former. Red explosions were also involved-- a lot of them, in fact. I do not know anything else about the terrain or biome (tropical, desert, arctic, etc) or which actors (if any) were present. It could even have been for a scene from Rogue One, given that both productions have been running through Pinewood. I personally have no idea, I just get that feeling for some reason. 'Trench warfare' just seems more fitting for a ""gritty"" film like R1 (altho it's Rian Johnson, so who knows). I don't really have more details I can share at this time. I know it's kind of lame and probably much less than people were expecting, so I'll be leaking the runner-up option as well.
Next up is Phasma. Last time I revealed that she will lose an arm in VIII (and more). This injury is not inflicted upon her by Rey or Luke or even Kylo, but by Finn. Not only is it done out of anger (duh) but apparently it is specifically an act of revenge. For what, I cannot say.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/4n0ntj/bit_more_info_on_episode_viii_scenes_and_maybe_r1/).

There have also been a number of smaller things like character and vehicle descriptions that have already been confirmed through trailers and the like.  The only other thing of note that has't been outright confirmed (or refuted to my knowledge) is a [description of a scene](https://makingstarwars.net/2016/05/star-wars-episode-viii-the-knights-of-ren/):

&gt; Recently I glimpsed some photos of a set on the water at Malin Head. On the shoreline were seven men in black. There might be more but some of the people are hard to make out. All of these people are wearing all black with helmets, resembling medieval knights with weapons. The characters are not wearing the black covers to hide their costumes like they did back at Dubrovnik. These are actual black costumes. It is my opinion and the source’s opinion that these are the Knights of Ren. Kylo Ren could always have another gang of warriors in black but I think its likely they’re the guys we saw in The Force Awakens. 

&gt; There are “black helmeted medieval-looking figures” going after Luke Skywalker and Rey on the coast of Ahch-To. The guys I once referred to as Jedi Hunters back in the day were described in the same way back during the production of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

&gt; From what I have heard a few times, Rey is reluctant with (if not angry at) Luke Skywalker because she has to kill Kylo Ren and she doesn’t want to do it. The scene that follows appears to be when the showdown finally begins. I suppose she accepts her duty or has no choice but to fight.

&gt; The text below is what the source(s) witnessed:

&gt; * Luke Skywalker and Rey are on Ahch-To just before nightfall as the sun sets in the background and it starts to rain.

&gt; * Rey’s hair is pulled back. She doesn’t have the vest from VII on.

&gt; * Luke and Rey are wearing the costumes we described before.

&gt; * Kylo Ren and the Knights of Ren turn up along the coast.

&gt; * Kylo Ren continues advancing towards the heroes with the Knights of Ren.

&gt; * Kylo does not wear the mask here.

&gt; * Kylo has the same cross guard saber as he did in VII.

&gt; * Kylo’s costume looked the same as in VII.

&gt; * Rey and Kylo Ren duel one-on-one and end up fighting along the cliff face overlooking the nighttime water.

&gt; * Kylo wants his revenge after Rey disgraced him.

&gt; * The Knights of Ren go for Luke Skywalker while Rey is left for Kylo.

&gt; * Luke Skywalker engages the Knights on the beach while Kylo attempts to kill Rey.

&gt; * The first black knight has an axe and moves towards the Luke but is Force pushed away to his death after being thrown through the air.

&gt; * After Luke dispatches the first Knight he ignites his green lightsaber.Luke moves through each Knight one-by-one.

&gt; * Rey and Kylo’s battle moves up to the side of a cliff.

&gt; * Suddenly Rey is nowhere to be seen. She’s taken out of the battle; she’s either wounded or appears to go over the side of the cliff.

&gt; * Luke Skywalker casually walks towards Kylo to finish him but Kylo retreats when he sees his crew defeated.

&gt; * Luke Skywalker is a badass Jedi and he’ll destroy your squad.

&gt;One source commented:“A lot of wire work was used.”

&gt; Luke Skywalker fights the Knights of Ren using the Force and then his sword, a mixture of wizard and warrior. While we can confirm that Luke does use his lightsaber, we think we can confirm the color too; the lightsaber was green for the light-rod on set. So it appears Luke still has his Return of the Jedi saber after all these years. There were also white flashing effects used in the battle.",do9wrzf,t3_75y4i8,,89,StarWarsLeaks,,,2017-10-12
saffroncake,"I think starwarsnonsense may be seriously on to something with her speculations in this Tumblr post. What if Luke’s students weren’t killed and the temple/academy destroyed by Kylo and/or the First Order as a deliberate act of sabotage, but as collateral damage when Ben lost control? Could it be that this event coincided with the revelation, as documented from Leia’s perspective in BLOODLINE, that Darth Vader was Ben’s grandfather? Could this be why Kylo is so obsessed with Vader, and the “power of the Dark Side” which he believes Vader showed him (perhaps in that very moment when Ben became Kylo and destroyed everything Luke had built)?

Just imagine Ben Solo, trying to be a good Jedi apprentice while struggling all the time with this elemental power he can barely control, plus Snoke constantly whispering insidious and seditious ideas in his ear (probably in a way that makes Ben believe it’s HIM thinking it; it’s like having a devil on his shoulder and no angel on the other).

All his life he’s tried to be like his grandfather, the great Jedi hero and martyr Anakin Skywalker, and then all of a sudden he finds out – FROM A PUBLIC HOLONET – that Anakin was actually Darth Vader. And that all this time, not only his mother and his father but Luke, his uncle and master, were hiding this from him. Trying to keep Ben from turning into him.

Can you imagine? KABOOM doesn’t even begin to cover the reaction. The shock, the fury, the sense of utter betrayal, and underneath it all the Force, giving vent to his blind, explosive and uncontrollable rage. And when the storm subsides and the dust settles, Ben Solo realizes with horror that everything around him – the temple, his fellow students – is completely destroyed. Even Luke is buried deep in the rubble, and for all Ben knows he’s probably dead.

Meanwhile, Leia’s still reeling from the shock of having her parentage publicly exposed, and knows Ben must be feeling it too. She tries to reach him and Luke, but she can’t. She records a message and sends it hoping it will reach him, but of course it never does because by then Ben is on his way to Snoke.

All this time I’ve been thinking his turn to the Dark Side was at least partly ideological – if this theory is true, it WASN’T. He became Kylo because he’d already destroyed everything and killed a bunch of people (including Luke, as far as he knew) and believed he had nowhere else to go. I think the ideology came mostly after the fact – he had to somehow rationalize the choice he’d made out of horror and guilt and shame and hopelessness, and how better than to use the political jargon he’d learned from his mother?

You can see why he’d be so obsessed with order now, seeing as he is literally the child of chaos. Why he keeps his fists clenched tight and his emotions hidden behind a mask. Why does Kylo slash and punch things when he’s angry? It’s so he won’t give in to the Force and just blow everything and everyone around him to kingdom come. Again.

And it totally explains Luke’s reaction to Rey’s power in the trailer, too. He doesn’t react with awe or even wariness: he looks at the crack in the ground behind her like Indiana Jones looks at a snake. Not only has he seen this kind of raw power only once before, the last time it happened he got buried under a pile of rubble and nearly died, and dug his way out to see everything he’d worked for in flames and everyone around him dead. Luke isn’t crazy, he has PTSD. And Mark Hamill is a genius who deserves more credit, dagnabbit, because that was ALL THERE in his eyes in the trailer. In EVERY scene.

Am I reaching too far here? I don’t think I am. It fits the timeline. It fits what we know from the books and the trailers and the Forceback in TFA. I’ll be very surprised if we don’t end up seeing something very like this backstory in TLJ.",do8wd1s,t3_75tt4s,,84,starwarsspeculation,,,2017-10-12

She doesn't quite get away but luckily the thing she's transporting reaches an old member (Obi Wan, Brom) of an ancient order of martial monks (Jedi, Dragon Riders) and an orphan (with parents secretly from the same order of monks) from the nearby village who lives with his uncle (Luke, Eragon).

Quazifuji,"&gt;In his head it's like he is doing the right thing, that makes it really unlike a normal ""I choose to be evil"" sith.

I actually see it as almost the opposite.  Anakin thought he was doing the right thing.  He started turning to the Dark Side because he thought he could use its power for good (or at least what he saw as good, even if it was actually quite selfish), and eventually became convinced by Palpatine that the Jedi were the ones who were truly evil.  Anakin wanted to be good but was seduced by the power of the Dark Side.

Kylo Ren wants to join the Dark Side.  He wants that power, and he doesn't want to care that he has to be evil to get it, but he does care, because he still does (or at least did for most of TFA) have some morality in him.  Both Kylo and Anakin are conflicted between the power of the dark side and the morality of the light side, but which one they're consciously pursuing and which one they've got in their subconscious and are struggling to suppress is the opposite.  Anakin consciously wanted to be good but struggled to suppress his lust for power, Kylo wants power but struggles to suppress his sense of morality.

I'm really interested in seeing that catalyst, though.  What happened to Ben Solo when he was training with Luke that convinced him that the power of the dark side was worth sacrificing his morality for?  What led to Darth Vader becoming his role model, and not a lesson in the dangers of succumbing to the dark side?

I assume we'll get those details sometime in the next two movies (I've been completely avoiding any info about the Last Jedi, so I have no idea if the info we have already hints at his backstory being in there, although I assume at least part of it will involve Luke training Rey while Snoke trains Kylo and it seems pretty likely that at least some of the details of his betrayal would come up in the process), and I hope it lives up to the potential.  It'd be pretty easy for him to basically just become Darth Vader now, and TFA was just his transitional stage similar to Episode 3 Anakin, but I hope he's more interesting than that.  I kind of want him to end up going full evil in the end rather than having a Vader-style redemption just to be less cliched, but what I'm most hoping for is that we spend a lot of time in doubt about whether he'll have a chance at redemption or not.",do983ge,t3_75sa0e,,5,AskReddit,,,2017-10-12

In other news; Of course its ray, she is the last Jedi. the Jedi Code forbade emotion and attachments in all regards. He was taught by Obi-wan and Yoda who, in their old age and experience, began to adopt a different philosophy to the Jedi Code. Luke defied these masters, harassed anger to fight for his friends, father and rebellion against the Emperor. He has many attachments, not even counting his nephew. 

Ray however, spent a majority of VII letting go of her sole attachment to her parents who abondoned her. She has had nothing, lived with nothing and goes to Luke solely because she needs the training. The duty to the force...the only way.

I started collecting Star Wars figures as an adult just a few months ago. After I dug out all my old Mon Calamari, I decided to set out and find all of them. Most were relatively cheap and easy to find. The hardest were the Vintage Collection pilot, Ibtisam (blue one), and the Clone Wars Jedi. The last one I got was Ibtisam.

Gerry-Mandarin,"I think Han, Leia and Luke should all be dead by the end of the ST. Purely because that's how the other two trilogies are structured.

If you look at the OT, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Palpatine, Vader- all the legends of the previous generation meet their end. They hand off the Galaxy to the fates of Luke, Leia, Han, Lando etc to forge their own paths and make their own mistakes unshackled by what came before.

Even if you look at the PT you have Dooku and Windu, two legends of the previous generation of the Jedi Order die. Qui-Gon, who is clearly placed as the last best hope for the Galaxy is killed. We see the final outgoing democratic chancellor. These characters who should have near mythical status within the world, all fade away to nothing, letting Palpatine, Anakin, Obi-Wan etc to take the reigns as the shapers of the Galaxy.

It should be the same here. Finn, Ben, Rey, Poe should be allowed to shape the Galaxy after this story as much as Luke, Leia, and Han did after the defeat of the Empire. Completely free of the mistakes of the generation before. ",do9dymd,t3_75u6u0,,4,starwarsspeculation,,,2017-10-12

InverseFlash,"Holochronicle # 1
My name is Darth Cantanus. The everwise Lord Plagueis has tasked me with finding the source of eternal life from the brink of the Outer Rim. Apparently it is on the bottom of the planet known as Kamino, and the planet is full of idiotic people uglier than Rancors. I set off tomorrow.

Holochronicle # 7
The source of eternal life has been found! The only problem is I must drain life from others via the artifact, a rare Huttese diamond. That Jabba must have dropped it on a smuggling run. What a fool! I took the life of every creature on the planet, and I told the last survivors I was a Jedi! They, of course had no idea I killed everyone else, and I told them to build an army to defeat that ""evil Sith monster."" I even implanted a turn-on-the-Jedi command. There's no way Plagueis will get rid of me. What a bunch of Bantha dung.

Holochronicle # 16
I gave the diamond to Lord Plagueis, and he said I would rule the galaxy with him! Then I dropped it on his foot. I escaped with my life.

Holochronicle # 22
Lord Plagueis has taken a new apprentice. I am hiding in a trash compactor behind his house. This new apprentice is very full of himself. He already has hos own Darth name. What kind of a name is Darth Sidious. Sounds like a mix of sad and hideous. Heh heh.

Holochronicle # 41
Lord Plagueis is dead. The apprentice took his life last night. If I can kill the apprentice now, I'll be uncontested as the greatest Sith in the galaxy!

Holochronicle # 42
My first attempt has failed. He has acquired two new apprentices, one called Maul and one called Jar Jar. There's no way I can kill him now.

Holochronicle # 77
Maul is dead, and Jar Jar is in deep cover. I will kill him with a poison, tonight. Wait a parsec. If I kill every saber-wielder in the galaxy, I'll be THE GREATEST SITH LORD EVER! *cackling noises*

Holochronicle # 101
This will be my 8th attempt to take out Tyrannus. He managed to get himself some swanky bodyguard, but I've planned ahead. That bodyguard is situated on Kamino, all I have to do is activate Order 35.

Holochronicle # 107
I have recieved word Sidious is planning to build a Death Star with help from the Geonosians. With my army inbound, I'll easily take the plans for myself.

Holochronicle # 110
I have been failing in every way for over a decade. I'm considering falling on my lightsaber.

Holochronicle # 111
What a show! Sidious just executed Order 66! My job is so much easier!

Holochronicle # 112
I just killed the last Sith Lord below Sidious. The hype is real! My capstone awaits!

Holochronicle # 674
I have successfully poisoned Sidious's dinner. The toxin will cause him to explode if he moves too fast! I have finally succeeded! All that's left is that pest Vader.

Holochronicle # 675
Vader killed himself and his lord in one fell swoop. Hah! I'm finally the greatest in the galaxy!

Holochronicle # 676
My first order of business is a new apprentice. I already have a suitable candidate. He has chosen the name Wurdevos.

Holochronicle # 677
He tried to kill me in my bed, so I fed him to the Sarlacc. My next candidate calls himself Snoke. He shows much promise.

Thetheoryawakens,"I like this.

I think Snoke was in fact tricking Sidious. Only Sidious could hear his call not Vader. He was influencing Sidious with a false promise of the full power of the dark side.  

Anakin fathered children that the emperor never knew about, that is the key. It proves Sidious was not in control of the events that led Anakin to forbidden love.  Sidious didn't cause Anakin's dreams, or shroud the galaxy, he was told about the dreams and took advantage of the shroud veil blinding the Jedi.

Snoke is in command of the Dark Side and has been the whole time. Sidious was chasing after powers he didn't have, dreaming of performing a ritual with an apprentice as bait. 

Snoke knew Anakin had children and wants them. Children was a weird thing the emperor was experimenting on too, and he sent them to Snoke in the unkown regions after the Battle of Jakku, maybe they were going to be a part of the ritual Sidious wanted to do. The FO emphasizes children as stormtrooper stock. It is a theme that repeats. Snoke went after Kylo in the womb. Rey said she could feel it inside her as a child. Anakin slaughtered the jedi younglings.

Something funny going on with all the child dark side stuff.

But Luke isn't a child anymore, neither is Kylo or Rey, but they can have children.......which Snoke undoubtedly wants. I smell another trilogy. 

Maybe if order 66 was successful, Snoke would have swooped in and devoured Luke and Leia. Now he wants to kill the last Jedi and feast on Kylo and Rey's babies for the unlimited Powaaaaaaaaa. How is this a kids movie again? ",do99iv6,t3_75tbfb,,2,starwarsspeculation,,,2017-10-12

Ninjaba,"Harkin's Cine1 at Cerritos hands down. They use a laser projector and dolby atmos for sound. Pretty much the clearest image quality I've seen out of a theater besides watching Dunkirk 70mm at AMC Citywalk. I just saw Blade Runner 2049 here and it was just stunning and so clear.

I've seen the Arclight, Dolby Cinemas at Burbank / Norwalk, various imax laser movies at Citywalk and yet Harkins tops them at image quality for some reason. Also the dolby atmos seems to be better than the one in dolby cinema too, like they both have the seats that shake with the bass, but the one at harkins feels more impactful and pronounced. 

I haven't been to TCL yet, but I got tickets to watch Last Jedi there. Other theaters I've yet to go, but want to one day are Regal RPX and Cinemark XD. 

4dx at LA Live is pretty fun too depending on the movie, just note that the seat shaking can distract away from the plot for someone new to it. Force Awakens was the first movie I saw in 4dx and made the plot quite hard to follow the first time, but man it was so fun. I've seen more movies in 4dx since then, but none of them has had the same magic as the first time. Also the seat shaking will probably just be annoying if you are watching a bad movie.

LooseChangeCannon,"I think it also depends on the store and the dedication of the hunters. Take Walgreens for example...people give it so much crap for so many different reasons. Chances are if your Walgreens doesnt have something its not because it wasnt put out...its because someone got there before you.

I say this because with Pennywise soooo many posts pop'd up with the chase variant being found at their Walgreens. I think Walgreens gets that limited shipment and it has a 1:6 and boom! Chases for everyone that gets in early.

Recent story...

My Walgreens set up the Star Wars section one morning. They put their Maces (mine always had a full shelf of them) and some random Star Wars that was already at the Toy Section. A stray ""Porg"" was put there too. I thought well thats kinda lame all you did was move the star wars you already had to this shelf. Next day (a Friday) 3 Cloud City Movie Moments... picked up one. 

Weekend came and gone. I go in Monday morning and I see 3 Wedge Antilles sitting where the Cloud City were... Cloud City was now gone. I look up where all the Maces were the Friday before and there was the The Last Jedi line. Complete with two Walgreen's exclusives and one Chase Porg. I buy the Chase...not really feeling the Wedge....but I decided to check back in Tuesday... all the Wedges were gone.

That tells me as a long time hunter and collector of various toys and games...I am not the only Pop fan in town. This also lines up with when I asked about the NBC Pops and got told people had been calling and they did have some but they never seem to make it to the shelf. Pretty sure people who called were either able to hold them or just asked when they were put out so they could buy them asap.",do8y79x,t3_75twut,,2,funkopop,,,2017-10-12

Catshit-Dogfart,"I always rather liked the idea of balance meaning *neither one of them*.

After the movies there are no Jedi, no Sith, no high councils or dark pacts, no dark side or light side - everybody is just people. The force still exists and maybe there are people who can manipulate it, but they don't form a clergy and call themselves the defenders of the galaxy or anything. That's all in the past, the ""star wars"" are over, and it's the beginning of a new era of peace. Luke Skywalker is the last of the Jedi, and it just dies with him, he says goodbye to the last ghosts of that era at the end of the movie and then goes on to live and ordinary and peaceful life.

.

Now of course the old expanded universe would disagree, with the Imperial Remnant and the New Jedi Order and all that. And the new movies go against that too. Well, and ""word of god"" (George Lucas) has specifically said that balance means only jedi and no sith.

hoss1138,"When I was 6 my dad took me to see Return of the Jedi, and I was so hyped all day at school knowing we'd get to see it at a theater in downtown Reno. Watching that movie with him was one of the best memories of my life. May 15, 1983...one hell of a good day.

When I saw your RotS ticket from a theater in Salinas it reminded me of this. My dad lived in Salinas all his life and passed away last year. When I found out he died, I was watching The Force Awakens with my mom and I thought it was ironic because Star Wars was the one thing that my dad and I bonded over. He was a local musician and the City of Salinas recognized him as a ""Son of Salinas"" after he passed away. His friends remember him as a musician but I always remember him as that guy that made me love Star Wars.

Anyway, I thought it's pretty amazing how something as simple as a movie ticket could remind me that Star Wars transcends generations.  10 years is a long time to wait. 35 might be too (for me). But I have a feeling we and countless others will be loving life come December 15 this year.

tommmytom,"[So I did something similar here, and I'm going to do it again. It's important to consider all point of views and I think parts of this can be refuted. And this is coming from someone who has, in the past, on and off supported the Snoke=Darth Plagueis theory.](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75sh84/still_feelin_plagueis_theory_especially_after_the/do8z77n/?context=3)

&gt; NOTE ON THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THE EU

There are other ways to tie the three films together than Snoke being Darth Plagueis because of a small mention in Revenge of the Sith. Whether these ways are just as good as the possibility of Snoke being Darth Plagueis is debatable, of course, but there are certainly other ways.

&gt; MUSIC

I still think this can be refuted as generic dark side guy music, but that's just me. I get that it's the same motif and all though. It's certainly evidence though.

&gt; SNOKE REGENERATED

He may very well be ""regenerating,"" but this doesn't necessarily mean that Darth Plagueis is the only Force user who is capable of that, even if he's the only one whose been explicitly mentioned of midichlorian manipulation in the past. Snoke could still be a character on his own capable of such power as well, especially depending on who he exactly is. But this is certainly evidence to the theory as well.

&gt; WHEN I FOUND YOU

Interesting thought. I mean, maybe. Not much to work off of here, really, which is alright of course. Either you are right or wrong, and that's just something we will have to wait and see.

&gt; AWKWARD PANEL QUESTION

So that's the big thing thrown around in addition to the musical evidence, but honestly, I don't think it confirms anything either. As I said in my last post, Daisy Ridley probably hasn't ventured deep into Star Wars lore, particularly backstory lore and Legends/EU lore. She hears a Darth name that she doesn't recognize. There's a big dark side guy in the new movie that isn't named something like Kylo Ren, just a simple Snoke. A lot of dark side guys have had Darth names. I think she was honestly just asking a question of clarification because she was genuinely confused and maybe assumed this guy knew more about the character than she did, or that more information had been released about the character of which she was unaware. I think J.J. Abrams stopped her to try and prevent anyone from going ""SNOKE = PLAGUEIS CONFIRMED!"" but it clearly backfired. Kasdan may have legitimately been confused; he probably hasn't ventured much into the Star Wars lore itself either.

&gt; THE SUPREME LEADER IS WISE

Another popular one. It's a good line, I think. But a lot of characters are ""wise"" and called wise. I think it's just Kylo Ren defending his Supreme Leader... or something along those lines. I mean, indoctrinated peoples probably view their ""guided dictator"" as wise.

&gt; SNOKE JUST LOOKS LIKE A PLAGUEIS... COME ON

Well, considering there is no canonical appearance of Plagueis, this is sort of hard to defend in the first place. But Snoke doesn't look much like a Muun, if we go off of his Legends appearance. A lot of dark side guys physically decay away; that's canon. Heck, just being in the presence of the dark side causes some dudes to sort of melt away, like those Emperor's royal guards who were guarding Sith artifacts that Lando came across in some comic.

&gt; HE SAYS PALPATINE'S LINE

Yeah. Or it's just a parallel to Palpatine, and Snoke sort of fulfills his role in the sequel trilogy either way. It's a common line throughout the saga. Snoke doesn't seem to be conventional Sith anyway just by his physical garb and appearance. But an interesting point you raised as well.

&gt; THEY'VE BEEN CRPYTIC ABOUT SNOKE'S IDENTITY

Honestly... they've also said that Snoke is just Snoke, that Snoke is a new character, and his backstory doesn't matter that much. Rian Johnson himself has said something along the lines of viewing Snoke similarly to the Emperor in the OT; you just don't need to know much about him going forward in the story (whether or not you disagree with him here is another matter - I actually do disagree with him in some ways, but he's the director and writer of the next film, so it may reflect on Snoke's role in that film.) I think this is largely fan interpretation of Snoke, which was inevitable anyway since he's the new big baddie in these three films where that role has been fulfilled solely by Darth Sidious in the past six. It's a sequel to an already established story, so we want to know where this guy came from and how he came to power after Palpatine. I think that Lucasfilm is just making a point that it doesn't really matter. Snoke is Snoke. It's not necessarily cryptic. But there's definitely intentional mystery to his backstory. Also, apparently Snoke's CGI wasn't finished until late into production, hence why we hadn't seen him before the film's release.

&gt; BORROWING FROM THE EU WITHOUT USING IT

Pretty sure the first one is a concept art of the Jedi Killer (Kylo Ren) dueling Kira (Rey) and Sam (Finn), not of the character that would become Supreme Leader Snoke. There's been similar concept art of Kylo Ren in the past too.

&gt; PHYSICALLY SIMILAR

Like I said, there's not much in canon to go off of, but yeah, they could be borrowing from the EU. But really, the only thing to go off here is that they're both aliens. I guess Snoke sort of looks like a  fatter Muun? But Muuns kinda look like generic alien but really thin anyway... so I dunno, this is just a tough one.

&gt; HE ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE PALPATINE MURDERED THE SHIT OUT OF HIM

That's definitely a possibility, but there could be all sorts of explanations for Snoke's injuries. Injured by the ancient Jedi thousands of years ago. So immersed into the dark side that he's decaying as he delves deeper into it (which the concept art book of TFA hints at anyway). Injured while dueling against Luke Skywalker. Thrown out a window after being electrocuted by Force lightning and falling smack on the streets of Coruscant. Survived the Death Star's explosion at Yavin 4 by Luke Skywalker. Well... okay, maybe not the last two, but you get the point.

&gt; ELEGANCE OF THE STORY

Yeah, I would definitely say that legacy is a big part of the sequel trilogy, which was inevitable anyway since it's the *sequel* trilogy. How much is Plagueis the legacy of Sidious though, considering they had a Master-Apprentice relationship? There are other ways Snoke could be tied to Sidious. Maybe he was an ancient evil creature of the dark side reawakened by Sidious. Maybe Sidious released him when he sent his Contingency officers to the Unknown Regions where he was hearing that dark side voice calling to him and reaching out to him.

&gt; THERE ARE NO SITH IN THE FORCE AWAKENS

Yeah, there's definitely precedent for someone renouncing the Sith and no longer considering themselves to be Sith as seen with Maul in Star Wars Rebels.

&gt; HE'S NOT A MUUN

You take that back! Not all Muuns are ugly! :(

&gt; HE'S AN ANCIENT BEING FROM THE OUTER REGIONS

Actually, there has *never* been an official statement that Snoke is ancient. The most we know about his age is that he's witnessed the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire, which could mean a number of things (maybe he only saw it through Force visions) and Serkis stating that he's aware of the past to a great degree (which again could be Force visions). Lots of people just assume that Snoke is ancient, which isn't totally unreasonable for a variety of reasons. So yeah, we know nothing.

&gt; IT'S SILLY TO HAVE A CHARACTER REINCARNATE/REGENERATE

To be fair, Snoke's CGI wasn't finished until late into production of The Force Awakens and perhaps still wasn't entirely accurate of the character's physical representation that we're finally seeing in The Last Jedi. He was all in the shadows in the actual presentation of the film, and he only appeared as a hologram. Lucasfilm may have given The Last Jedi production team more free rein in Snoke's physical appearance. Maybe he's regenerating or maybe this is just how he's really supposed to look. There's no official confirmation yet though.

&gt; PABLO TWEET

He really could have just avoided replying altogether though. I think there's a difference between beating around the bush and repeatedly not only denying the theory explicitly but *mocking* it. He could have denied it once. But he continues to make fun of it and those who support it, and he's not the only one at Lucasfilm who has done so. It would just be bad PR at this point.

&gt; J.J. DENIAL

To be fair, J.J. Abrams later said he regretted his statements regarding Khan and Into Darkness, so I doubt he would do it again... right?

&gt; CLOSING

Just to make it clear myself, I'm doing this for discussion purposes. Stirring the pot. Acting the contrary. Not trying to be a dick or anything like that. I myself have been on and off with this theory. It's still fun to talk about, I think.",dob2khv,t3_763c6n,,11,starwarsspeculation,,,2017-10-13

BlindManBaldwin,"&gt; Luke is the antagonist

*breathes in, breathes out*

**WARNING**: Don't read this unless you want a really geeky, self-indulgent ramble. 

I can absolutely 100% guarantee Luke isn't an antagonist. I'll spare you the whole rant and give just the condensed version. 

It would completely go against his character. Luke hasn't been explored too in-depth in new canon yet, but the one constant is he **is** firm in his beliefs. In *From a Certain Point of View*, Obi-Wan sees future Luke (heavily implied to be on Ahch-To) and describes him as ""full of regret and sorrow"". If he was evil, why would he be feeling these things? 

Before you say *But Blindy, Vader feels these things so that's lazy analysis*. Yes, he does. But that's *literally* Anakin's entire character; suffering and self-hatred. So, him feeling regret immediately after becoming Vader (and at varying levels for the next 20 years) is completely in-line with character. 

The whole point of Luke's character (in new canon) is to show that raw power and strength is irrelevant and the true worth of a Jedi comes from their moral compass and dedication. Luke, more than any other character in canon, has the strongest and most unflappable morals. He wasn't going to kill Vader and he wasn't going to become his apprentice either. 

I wouldn't be surprised if we had a scene in TLJ showing that Luke *refused to kill* Ben Solo because of how much Luke doesn't like killing and violence (see *Heir to the Jedi*). The whole point of Luke's isolation in the ST is to emphasize how much he hates war and doesn't want to get involved again.

That's why I find the Yoda/Luke comparisons so lazy and unoriginal. OT Yoda was exiled for a purpose; to one day train Luke (or actually Leia according to *A Certain Point of View*). Luke, as far as we know now (though I doubt this holds but that's just speculation), isn't hiding for any purpose. He just wanted to get away from all the pain and suffering that his family has caused the galaxy. 

Besides it completely going against the thirty-plus year canonical history of Luke's character, it frankly would go against the whole point of the ST. While I have a litany of criticisms about what JJ Abrams did to the series, the one thing I do like is how he showed that our heroes are good people, but still flawed. 

Han Solo is still the lovable, swashbuckling pilot when we saw him on screen last, but he's grown reclusive after his son became a monster. He regressed to his life before he got involved with the Rebellion and was going to live like that for the rest of his days. Leia is still the masterful tactician and leader, but she's full immersed herself in her work to distract herself from the fact that her government (the New Republic) was plagued by the same problems of the old and her regret of sending her son to train with Luke. Luke, meanwhile, responded to this crisis much like other Jedi have before. He hid himself within the force (I wouldn't be surprised if Ahch-To was later revealed to have similar force properties like Dagobah or Mortis) to learn more about the origins and the make-up of the force. 

I'll spare you my personal speculation but it would be very lazy writing and go against the whole spirit of the character (and frankly the franchise as a whole) if Luke was the ""big bad"". I'd honestly check out of the whole ST if they did that. ",dobblok,t3_764q2e,,8,DenverBroncos,,,2017-10-13

PieBlaCon,"**The Amazing - Ambulance**: The Amazing are a Psych Folk band from Sweden (English lyrics, though) that record songs heavy with improv after just 1-2 takes. They might be releasing new music soon, but this release from last year is something else. I come away loving this album more every time I listen to it. It's such a slow burn, and if I had given it a better chance when it came out in July, I would have made a bigger deal about it during list season. It would be top 5 of 2016 if I redid my rankings. The last three tracks of this record are what really do it. It's a good album up until that point, but the closing numbers are on another level. They're a bit slower and the emotion behind the vocals will send you soaring. The atmosphere is simply stunning. The thing is, you might need to give this album time, potentially even with extended gaps between listens. That's what it took for me. [Here's the opener](https://youtu.be/JeSqVrueOrA). Let me know what you think, or if you've already heard of this band/album, do you enjoy it? **8.5/10**

**The National - Sleep Well Beast**: I revisited this one because I couldn't stop saying/singing ""I gotta walk it back, walk it back..."" On the whole, it's a good album. Maybe too long for me, but I'm not really a fan of The National, so it's not that the songs like ""Turtleneck"" and ""Carin at the Liquor Store"" are bad, it's just I wish I could trim the fat. I'm sure longtime fans enjoy the 57min run. **7.5/10**

*New Listens*

**St. Vincent - MASSEDUCTION**: Only one listen, but it's interesting. I actually enjoyed LA and NY as singles (held off on ""Pills"" earlier this week) so my expectations weren't as low as some. [Here's some 2-3 word first impressions on a notepad](http://i.imgur.com/ccvtiFT.jpg)

**Iron &amp; Wine - Beast Epic**: I've pretty much come to terms that I like the idea of I&amp;W better than I like the actual music. Songs like ""Lion's Mane"" and the cover of ""Love Vigilantes"" are such beautiful listens, but when it comes to full length LPs, I come away thinking they're just OK-good (with great individual moments). *Beast Epic* is no different. ""Bitter Truth"" and ""Song in Stone"" whisk me away and are just so pleasant. Other tracks are good, but I usually feel like doubling back to those two. It's a short album, so the fact that it doesn't overstay its welcome is probably why it's my 2nd favorite by Sam (behind the debut), but I just want to like these albums so much more, because they feel so honest. **7.25/10**

**Dirty Protectors - The Glad Fact**: I feel a bit lame for liking this so much, because I know, w/o a shadow of a doubt, that I'd say it was trash if someone played this for me a year ago. Since listening to the s/t album earlier this year (my AOTY), I've gone backwards through their/his discography, and I can't believe how much I had been missing out (I still need to listen to *Slaves Graves and Ballads*). Every single album is, at a minimum, great. I'd consider this one the weakest, but I still really enjoy it. ""Winter is Here"" is a standout, as is ""My Offwhite Flag"", but nearly every track is great. I'm also really shocked at how little this album is written about/listened to online. Very little in the way of articles and YT plays. **8/10**

**Blade Runner 2049**: Loved it. It retains the atmosphere, pace, and world that I enjoyed from the first film, but has better characters, writing, and a more dynamic plot. I will say that Hans Zimmer's score pales in comparison to the 82 classic, as he once again relies on the tired, loud **WOMP**. The only time I was moved by the music was when they re-used a certain track from the original (without spoiling anything) **5 Stars**

**The Last Jedi Trailer**: Lots of misdirection, I think, and I like that. I have no idea where they're going with this one. I wish they didn't show that scene with Rey and Snoke, but I did audibly gasp when I saw that, so it did its job, I guess. So close!",dobb9u1,t3_76545s,,7,indieheads,,,2017-10-13
Quiddity131,"BB6 was amazing! Still probably my favorite season of the show. The first ever episode of Big Brother I saw was a late season episode of BB6, around F5 or so as I distinctly remember Howie and his jedi stuff being featured. That was the only episode I saw while it was airing though, and it wasn't until BB7 that I starting watching every episode and becoming an obsessed fan.

Obviously the cast has several legends, chief among them Janelle. This is easily Janelle's best season, I actually hated her in BB7 and she was a disappointment in BB14. Is she still the most memorable and popular female HG the show has had? I know Rachel seems to be more of the latest big thing, but I would think most would say Janelle. I hope. Overall this was a really good cast. I think you could definately argue there were more duds here than in BB5 (Ashlea? Jennifer before her HOH week? Sarah was nice, but not the most memorable HG, Beau had one epic drunk fight with Janelle but that was about it for him), but so much of this cast delivered and you've got one of the most well liked alliances ever and one of the most hated alliances ever.

The secret partners twist was a great one, one of my favorites (and frankly one I'm surprised they have never used again). Aside from that and the buyback returning, when you think back at it this is kinda a season devoid of much twists. 

The hardcore split in the house, which went from basically week 3 until the end of the show is something we hardly ever see on this show (BBOTT, but that's been about it lately) and I loved. What helped make this season so amazing is just how down the middle it was and that the power shifted every single week. Infact HOHs were swapped from one side to the other every single week the entire season with the exception of the F8/F7 rounds where the Friendship won 2 in a row. It really is absurd how things went down that way, and these days we are quite used to the same side winning HOH over and over and over.

It is not the biggest season strategy-wise, but Kaysar really does pull off quite the feat with his HOH in week 3, putting together the Sovereign Six alliance and backdooring ""Cappy"". Maggie pulls a total mindfuck on Howie with his HOH which permanently puts the Sovereigns in the minority the rest of the season, even with Kaysar's return. Those aside the season is probably more filled with dumb strategic decisions than wise ones. This is our last season for true backdoors, with both Cappy and James going out that way. BB finally puts in the current veto format by introducing random picks with the next season. Only took them to BB7 to get that right!

Boy the fights and drama this season were amazing. Right off the bat we get them with Cappy, Michael, Kaysar and Ivette. The endless breakdowns and sob fests from the Friendship when Janelle won America's Choices, especially when she wasted the phone call from home on Michael, her showmance who got evicted week 2 instead of a family member were hilarious. ""The fans who watch this show are pieces of shit!"" Never forget. And boy, that week that Jennifer screwed over Kaysar was absolute gold. Contains my favorite exchange in BB history:

Janelle: ""Rachel, you're so beautiful!""

Rachel: ""Thanks Janie!""

Janelle: ""Maggie, you're such a bitch!""

Maggie: *stone faced silence*

With this, TLJ will be coming out on Blu Ray like two months before Han Solo and everyone will be like ""Wait, there was JUST a new Star Wars movie, what's all this now?""

And we still managed to fuck that up. I’ve trashed the MLS for a while now, and I’m gonna trash it even more. This falls on USSF and the owners. We’ve poured over a billion dollars into soccer and can’t field a men’s team to take us to a World Cup. Just pitiful. Last time I ever want to see an MLS player wearing my country’s shirt ever again. Don Garber can go fuck himself. The entire system needs to get blown up. The fact that there as only FIVE players under the age of 25 is astonishing.

SlamSlayer1,"I don't see it as cowardice, I see it as humanizing. Before he built his new Jedi Order, Luke when on a pilgrimage across the entire galaxy in search of knowledge on the Jedi, the Force, The Darkside, everything. He wanted to prepare himself for his destiny.

 Then Luke had EVERYTHING that he worked for, everything he built, all the good he did, destroyed by his own nephew. This power that he thought he could handle, that he didn't understand or take seriously enough (going by his words in the trailer) which ultimately lead to the destruction of his whole world. He basically had a hand in creating the second coming of Darth Vader.

So now he's the last jedi. If he dies, the light of the Jedi truly goes out forever. He's probably the last person in the galaxy with that collection of knowledge. If he's captured and turned, its just as bad. He's, by all intents and purposes, alone in the galaxy. Stricken with grief over his failure. He failed his students who trusted him, probably after spending a life time in fear under the shadow of the empire (Where their powers meant a death sentence). He failed his sister, he failed his nephew. He failed himself. 

According to Ryan, the Director of 8, Luke went into exile to obtain more knowledge. He wanted to learn why this cycle keeps repeating itself (Being the second time the Jedi were destroyed by one of their own). He also looks at himself as the center of trouble for the entire galaxy. The Skywalkers kind of keep ruining shit. So until he figures out what to do, he's cut himself off from everyone before he brings trouble to their door steps.

&gt;The Bomber was manned by at least a crew of three. A pilot, a bombardier, and gunner. The starships featured a hold full of proton bombs and were defended by two rotating ball laser turrets facing the rear of the ship.

-TheKingslayer-,"Yeah, and also lets not forget the visual guide (I think) change that happened a while back. It change from saying that ""Kylo Ren murdered his fellow Jedi students"" to ""He was responsible for their destruction"". It's a small but potentially significal distinction. What if Kylo Ren caused the death of his fellow students unintentionally and then joined the darkside and Snoke out of guilt. It would make a lot of sense too. He finally feels like he finds his place in the Jedi with Luke, after his parents have sent him away, then he accidentally kills them all in some demonstration of power. Luke might have been the one pushing him too hard, which is why he blamed himself for the destruction of his ""academy"" , but lashed out at Ben instead. He told Ben to leave, or something along those lines. His last encounter with Luke didn't end in  a duel like most people were expecting, but a massive argument. Remember, Adam Driver also said that Kylo's turn all boiled down to him not feeling loved enough of feeling betreyed. This would definitely fit that better than him purposely leading an attack on his friends and mentor. It also makes his alleigance with Snoke make a bit more sense too. He knows, deep down, that Snoke is a liar and just using him for his power, but we also know Snoke was likley whispering sweet nothings into Ben's ears since before he had even left the womb. 

Also, one last thing. From an MSW leak, it states that Rey learns something about Kylo that changes her opinion on him, and thus refuses to fight him. It would be even more cooler if we find out the reason Rey was abandond was becuase she scared her parents(or the people around her parents who forced them out) because she too was responsible for a massive destruction. It would make total sense for Kylo and Rey to relate to one another after this. They both have been pushed away from their parents, and now possibly Luke too. 

Mark Hamill also said that he fundamentally disagreed with Luke's actions in TLJ. What if rejecting his nephew, Ben Solo was one of them. Luke isn't really mad at Ben, but at himself. ",dob5e57,t3_762uwu,,3,starwarsspeculation,,,2017-10-13

SWR : Bendu / Condor / Wolf
TLJ : Luke / Rey / Kylo Ren (Ben Solo) / Snoke
FotJ : Luke / Ben Skywalker / Vestara Khai / Abeloth

In Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the Force wakes up after several decades. In Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the Force incarnates. She needs a new Father, a new Girl and a new Son, in order to restore her balance - and hence that of the entire galaxy. This new Force Wielders family is composed of Luke Skywalker, Rey and Kylo Ren. This is Rey's surrogate family, prophesied by Maz Kanata.

At first, like his father, Luke Skywalker will refuse his role. Between the fall of Ben Solo and the destruction of the Jedi Academy, his guilt is immense. He will have to get rid of it, because ""Balance is in the one who faces his guilt. Where does this quotation come from? It is the one that opens 'Overlords', the first episode of the Mortis trilogy ... As for Rey and Ben Solo, they are of course not Jedi like the others. They are more (""I saw in the rough an untamed energy and, beyond that, something really exceptional. / I only saw this raw power once."").

Antilogy_,"The Force Awakens. It had so much potential, but it ended up being a rewrite of a previous movie. TFA was filled with unbelievable sequences, and that's hard to do in a sci-fi movie. It missed a fantastic opportunity to explore good and evil through a less obvious, less established lens, but instead we get inexplicably powerful space nazis, an angsty villain who [spoilers in case somebody in this galaxy hasn't seen it], and plot devices used solely to advance the rehashed story and are otherwise inconsistent with characters, established lore, or logic itself.

Durp004,"Ok since you've already read the thrawn trilogy, or are in the process of it, I'd recommend going next into the Jedi Academy trilogy starting with Jedi Search. Afterwards you can skip the middle books and go right into the Hand of Thrawn Duology, by the same author as the first 3 and a great follow up to that series. There might be a few references you don't get as doing just those books you skip quite a bit, but TBH you're not missing anything great and you can infer what they mean when they happen to mention past events.

For pre-prequels there's a huge timeline to hit. I would highly recommend the Darth Bane trilogy. It's one of my favorite books series in the franchise and a set of books I've gone back over quite a few times. It is centered around the sith though so depending on your taste that might not be for you.

Are you into the star wars MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic? If that's a thing that interest you there were a few books released around it that center near its story. Of them I'd most recommend Revan, Deceived, and Annihilation. 

The rest of these are coming pretty close to the prequels but if you're a Darth Maul fan Darth Maul Shadow Hunter is a great book about that character and takes place shortly before Phantom Menace.

The last book I'll recommend has a small caveat. the Darth Plagueis book is one of the best books in the old EU, but it references a lot and can come across as a small information dumb. It centers around Darth Plagueis up until his death from Palpatine and covers a pretty large area of time even going alongside into Phantom Menace. It's a great book but if it sounds like something you'd be interested in I'd recommend reading it later on to fully get all the references and great subtle world building the author does. You can read it first if it really sound like something you'd like, but you might not fully understand some of the things that happen. ",dobx4rr,t3_766juv,,2,StarWars,,,2017-10-13

guster-von,"Is the term Jedi plural also? Obi Wan used the phrase, “the Jedi are all but extinct...” implying the group as a whole. 

Could the title “The Last Jedi” be a reference to the plural meaning of the term Jedi?

Who is left that is technically a Jedi in the physical sense in the episode 7, 8 &amp; 9 era? Is Luke a Jedi in the traditional sense? There are at least three who are around that were Jedi in the traditional sense, but they are ghosts. Obi Wan, Yoda and Anakin. I can’t imagine they all up and left after Return of the Jedi. Luke must have still communicated and trained with them. 

I like what OP laid out, but I do wonder if there will be some involvement with force ghosts. Luke’s journey didn’t end at Return of the Jedi, it just started.

I’m also considering the use of these characters in Force Awakens...Yoda’s voice, the use of Alec Guinness then transitioning to Ewan’s voice.

Garentea_EuW,"I gotta say, you did some nice work here but also mistakes.

First of all Muun's were always canon, we saw them in AotC (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/1/19/San_Hill_SW.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150831222225) and also in The Clone Wars where they were also officially called Muun (https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/clu-lesser_ce89b8aa.jpeg?region=0%2C26%2C1560%2C780) so they wouldn't need to change Plaguei's species Muuns may look dumb but it is possible to make them look pretty badass too.

Second mistake is Snoke's healing, he did not regenerate, as others pointed out there is only a very small gap between TFA and TLJ in the trailer his hand only covers up his major fractures but as you can see in this piture that got released he still looks the same (http://www.omega-level.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/star-wars-the-last-jedi-supreme-leader-snoke-2.jpg)

And I never saw any reason why he even should be Plagueis, what does it add to the story, Plagueis is a character the casual viewer knows nothing about and with Plagueis backstory erased he's nothing more than a new added character. Also I'm really convinced that Sidious as powerful as he was made really sure that Plagueis is dead and also would have felt if he wasn't, the reaction of the TFA crew is pretty simple to explain that they didn't expect a question like that and clearly didn't want to reveal anything about Snoke",dobrs6r,t3_763c6n,,1,starwarsspeculation,,,2017-10-13

This new trailer hasn't promised a single new thing and it feels kind of bland for it. It's the same characters, same situations as we saw in the last movie, just seeming more stretched out (Finn vs Phasma, Grumpy Luke on Island, Kylo killing parents, Pilot guy being Pilot guy, etc), and then recycled stuff from the OT (walkers attacking base, chewie in falcon, etc).

Similar how Rey/Ren Snow Fight was a mix of those three themes. Yet one can detect some changes to both Rey and Kylo themes which indicates to me that their characters are progressing from where they were in TFA. 

Also, as others pointed out, the trailer corroborates Rian's words that they are two sides of the same protagonist. It's their story or at least The Last Jedi part of the story (cause there's also the Resistance part) is their song of ice and fire.

A_Bull_Moose,"Unlike its predecessor, Cory in the House doesn't exactly come screaming off the starting line. Compared to That's So Raven, where you're immediately plunged headlong into a sexy story of intrigue and betrayal, this main quest can seem mundane, even perfunctory at times. But each time I stepped off the well-beaten path to blaze my own trail, it turned into a wild, open, exhilarating fantasy roleplaying experience, rife with opportunities to make use of its excellent combat. Even after over 100 hours with Cory in the House, it still tempts me to press on – there’s so much more I want to learn, and hunt.

Cory in the House is as dense and deep as the other Disney games in terms of RPG mechanics, and the overwhelmingly massive open-world environment has at once made that depth more intimidating, and in the long run, more rewarding. It’s difficult to express just how huge and open this world is: verdant, rolling fields liberally dotted with swaying foliage of every shape and size fill the space between loosely connected, ramshackle townships where people struggle to scrape by. A full day/night cycle and dynamic weather pull it all together, cementing Cory in the House's landscape as one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds I’ve ever seen. A handy minimap points you where you want to go, which might seem like a crutch, but honestly, without it, I’d have been hopelessly lost. That a world this size still feels so purposeful, and full of things to do is quite an achievement.

The one caveat on all that though, is the technical performance on both the Xbox One and PS4 versions. 30 frames per second was sometimes too much to ask, transitions between Cory in the House's two main maps are just a bit too long, and minor glitches do pop up from time to time. None of it ever impacted gameplay in any meaningful way, though it did compromise the beauty of the experience ever so slightly. Thankfully, PC players can expect a lot more. On a GTX 980, Cory in the House ran at 60 frames per second at all times on ultra settings. 

This new open-world map obviously has ramifications for the structure of the story, and though there are flashes of greatness, the main story is ultimately the least fulfilling part of Cory in the House. You might call it another case of The Elder Scrolls Syndrome. Our tale begins as a multi-continent search for Cory's long-lost lover Maiara, and Sophie, his surrogate daughter. My single biggest issue though, is that it never becomes much more: the overly long main story is essentially just Cory running errands for people in exchange for information on Sophie's whereabouts. It effectively maintains focus and momentum, but it feels more like a wild goose chase than an intriguing mystery to unravel, like the one we got in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.

Thanks to lots of excellent dialogue and voice acting there is some emotional payoff along the way, but it’s mixed in with too much padding in the form of meaningless fetch quests and collectathons. Every time I felt like I was on the verge of an interesting revelation, I’d have to suddenly stop to escort a goat, or search for a lost, narcoleptic dwarf. Heck, even Cory can barely hide his frustration with the constant parade of menial tasks at times.

It’s also worth noting that though you will get along fine without playing the first two games in the series, without the context provided by the Disney show, Sophie is more or less a complete stranger until the last quarter of the journey, which made it difficult to care about finding her as much as Cory in the House expected me to – especially given the slew of intriguing characters who are relegated to supportive background roles.

Thankfully, they all get chances to shine once you venture off the beaten path, and that’s where Cory in the House gets nearly everything incredibly right. Depending on your decisions in That's So Raven (which can be handily recreated via some dialogue early in the game), you’ll see lots of familiar faces returning to play a role in Cory's search, and once they have, they offer you a secondary line of quests that typically provide far more interesting scenarios to dabble in. Underground turf wars, assassination plots, love triangles, and unexpected alliances are all part of these optional romps. They’re all so meaty and full of rich story content that they feel like they should have been part of the main story.

The same can be said for a lot of the side quests you pick up in the field as well. Aside from the bevy of standard side-quests, monster lairs, and bandit camps generously littered about Cory in the House’s gargantuan land mass, you also get a bunch of monster-hunting Newt contracts to persue. Cory's quarry ranges from ethereal wraiths that need to be made tangible before you can harm them, to Foglets who conceal themselves in thick smog, waiting for a chance to strike. The payoff here is twofold: in keeping with the lore, these represent your most reliable stream of income, which is refreshingly significant due to an appropriately stingy in-game economy.

The other upside is that, more often than not, these hunts and other side activities provide interesting insights into a land being destroyed by war, and the many forces that play a role in shaping it. Best of all, you’re one of those forces. It may not shift the main story’s conclusion in monumental ways, but I often returned to places I’d visited earlier to find that a seemingly small decision played out in a very big way. There is no morality meter, no paragon or renegade rating. In the grayscale world of Cory in the House, there is only cause and effect; the decisions you make, both big and small, can legitimately change the world around you – far more so than most games that make similar claims.

Character progression and equipment choices are equally impactful. Relative to That's So Raven, I found that Cory in the House's RPG systems have been streamlined in some ways, and made more complex in others. In both cases though, the result is the same: a better experience. Simplifications to how you restock and use potions and oils makes them feel more practical and immediately useful, as you no longer need to meditate to do any of it. Sure, the old way was more in keeping with Cory lore, but in a wide open world, it makes less sense to expect players to predict and prepare for everything they might come across in advance. On the flip side, there’s a wider variety of powerful, interesting potions than ever, including those that greatly enhance mounted combat, and others that restore health as you cast spells (or Signs as Cory calls them).

Speaking of Signs, they’ve been improved across the board with alternate casting modes, and a wider variety of upgrades, making them impactful in every fight. It’s actually entirely viable to build a sign-focused Cory. I played him a lot like a Jedi actually, able to influence people’s minds in conversation, a powerful long range “force” push, and the ability to reflect crossbow bolts back to the sender (a returning ability that’s been made far more usable). The new skill system provides a good deal of flexibility while still rewarding players who want min/max for the best builds, and weapon and armor crafting is as deep and nuanced as ever, if not more so.

All of this shines through in Cory in the House's responsive, brutal real-time combat. Where combat in this series has up until this point felt vague and even a bit clunky, here it’s so fluid and satisfying that I walk around hoping for bandits to jump me just so I can repel their attacks with magical barriers, parry their blows with uncanny precision, and relieve them of life and/or limb with the occasional gory flourish. Disney has always done a great job of making me feel that I’ve outsmarted my foes, but for the first time here, controlling Cory feels tangibly badass with every successful fight.

The Verdict:
Though the straightforward and fetch-quest-heavy main story overstays its welcome, the option of joyfully adventuring through a rich, expansive open world was always there for me when I’d start to burn out. Even if the plot isn’t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate Cory in the House to a plane few other RPGs inhabit.",docncl4,t3_76a1sb,,90,gaming,,,2017-10-14
ghettosorcerer,"The Prequels are a parade of missed opportunities. The writing decisions are so astoundingly bad, that I'm not even sure if they're worth talking about on a critical level. If Yoda's decision here feels unnatural or like it comes out of nowhere, let me help explain why. 

My favorite question regarding these movies is: ""why didn't they go back and free Anakin's mom?""

At the end of the Phantom Menace, the heroes have won the day and defeated the Trade Federation armies. Anakin could personally ask this favor of any of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the galaxy: Padme, Palpatine, the Jedi, etc. There could have been a scene where Anakin says: ""look, I know that we can't have my mom hangin' around the Jedi temple, but couldn't you at least help me buy her freedom?"" 

The reason that nobody, including Anakin himself, thought to go back and free his mom from slavery is that the script forgot too.

In the next movie, it's suddenly a important and urgent task that Anakin abandon his duties and hurry to the rescue his kidnapped mother. Why? It wasn't important in the last movie, when you had all the time in the world. 

The whole point of the Prequels is to tell the story of how a noble Jedi was seduced by the powers of darkness and his show his tragic fall from grace. Most people think of Anakin's mother as some background or side character, but if the whole point is showing how Anakin becomes Darth Vader, then she is maybe one of the most important people in that transformation. As far as I'm concerned, when Anakin slaughters that entire village of Sand People in anger over the death of his mother, he IS Darth Vader at that point, and getting burned up and put into the suit is just a formality. 

It's a shame. Anakin's mom could have been a real character with depth, that added complexity to our hero's struggle. Instead, her only purpose is to raped to death by alien monsters, and that is expected to be enough for the audience to care. Come to think of it, I can't actually remember a single scene where Anakin's mom just sits down and talks to her son. She could have expressed real doubts about the path of the Jedi, which would be compounded by her death. Maybe her death could have been due to Jedi hubris or negligence, or even murdered by Count Dooku, Palpatine, or Darth Maul. It might have actually given our villains something interesting to do. 

Oh well. She's just another float in the parade of missed opportunities and interesting ideas that are left underutilized and unexplored.

I seriously can't understand the people that enjoy and defend the writing decisions in the Prequels. They're only redeeming quality is how hilariously nonsensical they are. ",doddd4j,t3_76d2tk,,51,flicks,,,2017-10-14

willbrooker,"I felt The Force Awakens was a pretty safe movie, though I can understand why they would take that route. It needed to reassure fans of one thing, essentially: this is not like the prequels. It was about rediscovering the old characters, activating that Original Trilogy nostalgia, and covering many of the same beats as the first film, while also bringing in new viewers through younger and charismatic actors, and accessible space-opera action. So, commercially, I think that made a lot of sense.

I understand that The Last Jedi aims to be much more unpredictable and to subvert our expectations, which also makes sense. TFA was a success, it provided a safe basis, and now the new team can branch out into more creatively experimental, independent areas. It's a longer movie, the trailer is clearly designed to keep us guessing, and from what I hear, the character arcs are going to cross over into grey areas between clear-cut good and evil.

I don't feel TFA will be criticised in the same way as the prequels, but I think it will be acknowledged that it was a relatively unadventurous movie.

paintnick,"OK there used a be a tradition at a Christmas party I used to attend where all the kids would get a gift from Santa.  I decided one year to do a biro sketch of my friend Nick, frame it, wrap it up and put it in the bag for Santa to give out.  Adults don't normally get presents so I remember seeing the shock and bewilderment on his face when his name was called out to collect his gift.
Nick is an all around great guy hes done a lot for other people and he's always up for a laugh.  He paints stuff himself and I know he appreciates art and that was part of the motivation behind doing it.
I am not going to sugar coat this- the drawing I did, it was a monstrosity.  I am not arty, I am not talented, I know the paintings are hideous...but do you know what?  I enjoyed doing it. In my mind I reflected on his 'surprise' on opening it.  I smiled the whole time drawing it.  The thing is I thought nick would instantly recognise that only I would be so daft to do something like this would be me, but he didn't.

He didn't have a clue.

So I did it again the next year, and the year after and the year after that. In fact it must be about 6 years I have painted him.  He still has no idea who it is. Each year I go with a theme.  I visited Rome one year and was inspired by the great masters,  Star wars came out one year so I made him a Jedi (with an unintended mullet), I also painted him slaying a dragon riding a unicorn.  I think that was my best one.

I know from my sources that Nick takes the painting home, puts it under the tree and opens it Christmas Morning.  He is desperate to know who did this and has been for years.  Now I planned on doing this for the next 20 years but unfortunately Nick has been diagnosed with cancer and this is probably going to be his last Christmas.
I want to do something special. 
I am keen to make this last one a good effort so I want to commission an awesome portrait for him.  A one that him and his kids can look at with fondness that represents how much of an awesome guy he is. So my plan is to give him the portrait along with 'revealing' myself this Christmas. I might even wrap myself up to.

wanabejedi,"Your Darth Maul point has always been one of the biggest problems I've had with the prequels. It's like Lucas forgot what made Darth Vader such an iconic Villain that to this day tops lists of the best villains of all time. You know what that is? It's not that he was a bad ass in episode 4, though that helps, it's that he didn't die in the first movie and had 3 full movies to grow as a character and really give him depth.

My other big pet peeve or problem with the prequels actually has to do with Yoda and Obi-Wan and what they do with Leia and Luke. In Empire when Luke finally goes to Degobah, Yoda is apprehensive about teaching him the ways of the force because as he puts it Luke is to old. If you don't think too much about it, it kinda makes sense since he is way older than Anakin when he started his training and the Jedi Council had serious problems with that and even had to make a special exception to allow him to be trained. But we are here to think more about it and of you do that all falls on its face when you realize that at the end of episode 3, Yoda and Obi-Wan realize that Palpatine and Vader are too strong and now there last hope are Vader's kids in that they hope that eventually they will be powerful enough to take them down. Ok cool sounds like a long term plan and the galaxy will suffer under sith rule for a long time but if that's your best hope so be it. Buuut you would think if that is their plan then why not start training them from the get go, how they believe is the correct way of training a Jedi so these kids have 1. The ""correct"" training and lessen the risk of them falling to the dark side and 2. Have the best chance to grow powerful to eventually take in daddy and palpy. To me it just makes no sense and now when I watch Empire and Yoda starts complaining that Luke is too old or to distracted or whatever bullshit, all I can think is ""motherfucker you were there at his birth and were the one that decided to send him to Tatooine so it's your own damn fault he is so old and has never had a single Jedi lesson in his life and keeps thinking about power converters in Toshi station"".",dodl3de,t3_76d2tk,,20,flicks,,,2017-10-14

I don't understand what you mean by ""spam"" Nen abilities since Gon has collapsed before from spamming his Jajanken (in the v Razor and v Knuckle fight). They've more often used strategy to defeat their opponents with Nen abilities only being part of the strategy. Examples being, Gon and Killua's fights with the guys from the Heaven's Arena, Gon v Genthru, Netero, Morel and Knov's way of thining Chimera ants, Gon v. Owl and Bat, Morel v. Leol.

&gt;  Instead, it just gets retconned into Nen, making his title as a ""Magician"" kind of meaningless when everybody with a Hunter's License could do neat tricks.

Personally, I never really attributed Hisoka's ""Magician"" title to Nen, honestly. I think that it fits him because, he is really good at tricking people, like how he tricked the Phantom Troupe about his fortune or Killua with his contacts, with Bungee Gum and Texture Surprise being just a tool that aids his trickery.      

&gt; By the time we got to the Chimera Ant arc, Nen turned into a Superpower Lottery.

If you mean that the abilities of the other hunters seemed fit for what they were doing, then wouldn't it be because of the Association picking the right people for the job?

Now, my input in one of your arguments.

&gt; How is this energy source that every Hunter and their mother can use, or at least knew of, was never mentioned until three arcs in. That'd be like if Luke Skywalker didn't find out about the Force until ""Return of the Jedi."" I get Gon not knowing about it since he had a sheltered upbringing, but why not Killua, whose family uses Nen like as if they were bodily functions? Why did Kite use a katana instead of his Nen Scythe when he rescued Gon?

The realistic reason would be that the rules for Nen wasn't completely fleshed out yet when the manga had started. My head canon would be that Killua's family needed him to know how to be strong without Nen first and intended to teach him when he got older but he ran away. With the latter, I really don't understand, why conjure something random when he had a perfectly good katana to use?

With your JJBA comparison, you say that Stands never got mentioned until the plot needed it; wouldn't that be the same with Hunter X Hunter and Nen? Learning Nen is the last part of the Hunter Exam, so isn't it natural that Gon would learn it after he became a hunter? 

As something that annoyed me, I don't know if your statement about Ki Attacks is directed towards Hamon or Nen but, after reading about Hamon (I'm not a Jojo Fan), aren't you severely underselling both of them with it? It is one thing to say that a power is similar to others with ""rules"" being the only difference but it's a completely different thing to summarize abilities that, while simple in principle, relies on the user's own ability to use them effectively as ""Ki Attacks with convoluted explanations"".

arcantiger,"LOl, first of all, where does the myth of Luke the Most Power Jedi Ever comes from? I don't care about EU and from GA PO. movies that the only canon. So please point out where it was said that Luke was the most powerful. He was the last but not the most powerful. He didn't defeat Vader in ROTJ cause he was more powerful or better but because Vader wasn't going for a kill. It's a classic ""I'll lose the fight so that I don't have to kill you"" moment. Vader didn't use all his strength and that's that. Then Palpatine attacked Luke who was all ""oh, I;m in paiiiiiin, ahhhhh, need help, please daddy do something!"" 

So, again, where is it that Luke is the most powerful Jedi? I don't see it and no one ever said so anyway. It wasn't shown and it wasn't told. So what's happening now is perfectly in character.

2) Vader was killed by the emperors force lightning. The emperor was killing Luke, but at the last minute darth Vader turned on him and threw him down a big hole, getting electrocuted in the process. 

3) Yoda died of old age after training Luke in return of the Jedi

4) we really don't know. There's a lot of speculation that rey is Luke's daughter but tbh I don't see it going that way. Could be wrong of course, but I don't think Rey's parent will be important to the story

5) dooku was a Jedi master that got fed up with the corruption of the senate and the ineffectiveness of the republic

That being said, lots of room for improvement not unlike most of the prequels.  My biggest gripe is how little time the movies actually spend dealing with the Clone Wars.  Episode 1 could have kicked off with an adult Anakin being discovered and the Clone Wars beginning.  Instead we get, IMO, a lot of setup and filler to set the stage for Ep2.  But then in Ep2 we have almost the same thing again, a whole lot of setup, introducing the Clones, and the first battle of the Clone Wars only taking place in the last moments of the movie.

paintnick,"OK there used a be a tradition at a Christmas party I used to attend where all the kids would get a gift from Santa.  I decided one year to do a biro sketch of my friend Nick, frame it, wrap it up and put it in the bag for Santa to give out.  Adults don't normally get presents so I remember seeing the shock and bewilderment on his face when his name was called out to collect his gift.
Nick is an all around great guy hes done a lot for other people and he's always up for a laugh.  He paints stuff himself and I know he appreciates art and that was part of the motivation behind doing it.
I am not going to sugar coat this- the drawing I did, it was a monstrosity.  I am not arty, I am not talented, I know the paintings are hideous...but do you know what?  I enjoyed doing it. In my mind I reflected on his 'surprise' on opening it.  I smiled the whole time drawing it.  The thing is I thought nick would instantly recognise that only I would be so daft to do something like this would be me, but he didn't.

He didn't have a clue.

So I did it again the next year, and the year after and the year after that. In fact it must be about 6 years I have painted him.  He still has no idea who it is. Each year I go with a theme.  I visited Rome one year and was inspired by the great masters,  Star wars came out one year so I made him a Jedi (with an unintended mullet), I also painted him slaying a dragon riding a unicorn.  I think that was my best one.

I know from my sources that Nick takes the painting home, puts it under the tree and opens it Christmas Morning.  He is desperate to know who did this and has been for years.  Now I planned on doing this for the next 20 years but unfortunately Nick has been diagnosed with cancer and this is probably going to be his last Christmas.
I want to do something special. 
I am keen to make this last one a good effort so I want to commission an awesome portrait for him.  A one that him and his kids can look at with fondness that represents how much of an awesome guy he is. So my plan is to give him the portrait along with 'revealing' myself this Christmas. I might even wrap myself up to.

 I am looking for someone/people (with more skills than me) to, draw/paint a portrait of him, or even if they wanted to do some digital artwork that would be awesome.   I hope the mods don't kills this.",dod7yc9,t3_76e0rp,,3,mildlyinteresting,,,2017-10-14

With 315 million after the weekend and Halloween upcoming, it's still possible that it tops Spider-Man to be the number 4 movie of the year domestically (though that will likely drop to 6 due to Justice League and The Last Jedi).

If the estimate holds then IT will be ahead of SMH by $8.9 mil on the 38th day of both movies. 

SMH made an additional $26.87 mil more since, putting SMH ahead of IT by $18.04. SMH should be done before Halloween while IT could/should get a expansion and gross an additional $20 plus mil.

CummyBot2000,"Unlike its predecessor, Cory in the House doesn't exactly come screaming off the starting line. Compared to That's So Raven, where you're immediately plunged headlong into a sexy story of intrigue and betrayal, this main quest can seem mundane, even perfunctory at times. But each time I stepped off the well-beaten path to blaze my own trail, it turned into a wild, open, exhilarating fantasy roleplaying experience, rife with opportunities to make use of its excellent combat. Even after over 100 hours with Cory in the House, it still tempts me to press on – there’s so much more I want to learn, and hunt.

Cory in the House is as dense and deep as the other Disney games in terms of RPG mechanics, and the overwhelmingly massive open-world environment has at once made that depth more intimidating, and in the long run, more rewarding. It’s difficult to express just how huge and open this world is: verdant, rolling fields liberally dotted with swaying foliage of every shape and size fill the space between loosely connected, ramshackle townships where people struggle to scrape by. A full day/night cycle and dynamic weather pull it all together, cementing Cory in the House's landscape as one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds I’ve ever seen. A handy minimap points you where you want to go, which might seem like a crutch, but honestly, without it, I’d have been hopelessly lost. That a world this size still feels so purposeful, and full of things to do is quite an achievement.

The one caveat on all that though, is the technical performance on both the Xbox One and PS4 versions. 30 frames per second was sometimes too much to ask, transitions between Cory in the House's two main maps are just a bit too long, and minor glitches do pop up from time to time. None of it ever impacted gameplay in any meaningful way, though it did compromise the beauty of the experience ever so slightly. Thankfully, PC players can expect a lot more. On a GTX 980, Cory in the House ran at 60 frames per second at all times on ultra settings. 

This new open-world map obviously has ramifications for the structure of the story, and though there are flashes of greatness, the main story is ultimately the least fulfilling part of Cory in the House. You might call it another case of The Elder Scrolls Syndrome. Our tale begins as a multi-continent search for Cory's long-lost lover Maiara, and Sophie, his surrogate daughter. My single biggest issue though, is that it never becomes much more: the overly long main story is essentially just Cory running errands for people in exchange for information on Sophie's whereabouts. It effectively maintains focus and momentum, but it feels more like a wild goose chase than an intriguing mystery to unravel, like the one we got in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.

Thanks to lots of excellent dialogue and voice acting there is some emotional payoff along the way, but it’s mixed in with too much padding in the form of meaningless fetch quests and collectathons. Every time I felt like I was on the verge of an interesting revelation, I’d have to suddenly stop to escort a goat, or search for a lost, narcoleptic dwarf. Heck, even Cory can barely hide his frustration with the constant parade of menial tasks at times.

It’s also worth noting that though you will get along fine without playing the first two games in the series, without the context provided by the Disney show, Sophie is more or less a complete stranger until the last quarter of the journey, which made it difficult to care about finding her as much as Cory in the House expected me to – especially given the slew of intriguing characters who are relegated to supportive background roles.

Thankfully, they all get chances to shine once you venture off the beaten path, and that’s where Cory in the House gets nearly everything incredibly right. Depending on your decisions in That's So Raven (which can be handily recreated via some dialogue early in the game), you’ll see lots of familiar faces returning to play a role in Cory's search, and once they have, they offer you a secondary line of quests that typically provide far more interesting scenarios to dabble in. Underground turf wars, assassination plots, love triangles, and unexpected alliances are all part of these optional romps. They’re all so meaty and full of rich story content that they feel like they should have been part of the main story.

The same can be said for a lot of the side quests you pick up in the field as well. Aside from the bevy of standard side-quests, monster lairs, and bandit camps generously littered about Cory in the House’s gargantuan land mass, you also get a bunch of monster-hunting Newt contracts to persue. Cory's quarry ranges from ethereal wraiths that need to be made tangible before you can harm them, to Foglets who conceal themselves in thick smog, waiting for a chance to strike. The payoff here is twofold: in keeping with the lore, these represent your most reliable stream of income, which is refreshingly significant due to an appropriately stingy in-game economy.

The other upside is that, more often than not, these hunts and other side activities provide interesting insights into a land being destroyed by war, and the many forces that play a role in shaping it. Best of all, you’re one of those forces. It may not shift the main story’s conclusion in monumental ways, but I often returned to places I’d visited earlier to find that a seemingly small decision played out in a very big way. There is no morality meter, no paragon or renegade rating. In the grayscale world of Cory in the House, there is only cause and effect; the decisions you make, both big and small, can legitimately change the world around you – far more so than most games that make similar claims.

Character progression and equipment choices are equally impactful. Relative to That's So Raven, I found that Cory in the House's RPG systems have been streamlined in some ways, and made more complex in others. In both cases though, the result is the same: a better experience. Simplifications to how you restock and use potions and oils makes them feel more practical and immediately useful, as you no longer need to meditate to do any of it. Sure, the old way was more in keeping with Cory lore, but in a wide open world, it makes less sense to expect players to predict and prepare for everything they might come across in advance. On the flip side, there’s a wider variety of powerful, interesting potions than ever, including those that greatly enhance mounted combat, and others that restore health as you cast spells (or Signs as Cory calls them).

Speaking of Signs, they’ve been improved across the board with alternate casting modes, and a wider variety of upgrades, making them impactful in every fight. It’s actually entirely viable to build a sign-focused Cory. I played him a lot like a Jedi actually, able to influence people’s minds in conversation, a powerful long range “force” push, and the ability to reflect crossbow bolts back to the sender (a returning ability that’s been made far more usable). The new skill system provides a good deal of flexibility while still rewarding players who want min/max for the best builds, and weapon and armor crafting is as deep and nuanced as ever, if not more so.

All of this shines through in Cory in the House's responsive, brutal real-time combat. Where combat in this series has up until this point felt vague and even a bit clunky, here it’s so fluid and satisfying that I walk around hoping for bandits to jump me just so I can repel their attacks with magical barriers, parry their blows with uncanny precision, and relieve them of life and/or limb with the occasional gory flourish. Disney has always done a great job of making me feel that I’ve outsmarted my foes, but for the first time here, controlling Cory feels tangibly badass with every successful fight.

The Verdict:
Though the straightforward and fetch-quest-heavy main story overstays its welcome, the option of joyfully adventuring through a rich, expansive open world was always there for me when I’d start to burn out. Even if the plot isn’t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate Cory in the House to a plane few other RPGs inhabit.",docnwe6,t3_76b942,,2,copypasta,,,2017-10-14

cosgrove360,"Well I think overall we'll have 5 seasons. Because if you think about it in the last game we had 5 as the battle of jakku was technically a free dlc. It was used to market the game for launch also and you got early access for pre-ordering. The crait dlc is being used in Battlefront 2 marketing with the john boyega trailer for example and he probably has already recorded the Finn voice lines. So I see a pattern there and think we'll get the crait season + 4 more. 

3 prequels, one rogue one/Rise Of empire season. After watching the last Jedi trailer it's possible that there'd be another sequels season where we get to see snoke which I'd be fine with he looks so dang powerful in the trailer but for now this is my speculation.

Dreossk,"Ah Star Wars The Old Republic. When it was announced back in October 2008, the gaming and Star Wars communities were greatly disturbed, as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in surprise, and were quickly excited. We were finally going to have a new Star Wars MMO. Maybe it could build on the bases of Star Wars Galaxies and eliminate its flaws? That would be the best game ever. We waited for years, reading every bit of info and analyzing every data and image. Back then I was a long time member of a website previously dedicated to SWG news that was now reborn thanks to SWTOR. I started to participate in putting up news about the future game and we were eventually selected by BioWare, along with a dozen of other fan sites, to come to Austin Texas to participate in the Fan Site Summit, being able to play the game before its release, in the very studios where it was being created, and meeting the developers and even Drew Karpyshyn, which I really looked up to. We played a lot, we listened, we shared each meal with them, talking about the game and the life of Star Wars game dev. We had no pressure, no contract, and I don't even think they checked our material to be sure it was okay for release, they trusted us. It was good times. The game had flaws but the joy of the situation still made us greatly appreciate it. Then later the game released. As the thread's author said, it was clunky, the combat kinda sucked, the character design wasn't great, the world design was terrible, the story delivery was stiff... We kinda knew all that, but only then did we realize that was it, the game was complete, and that's what the Star Wars MMO would be for the next few years. The most used term at the time was ""poor WoW clone"". I stopped WoW after Burning Crusade in 2007 but I knew SWTOR was very similar. I stopped after a couple of months.

After SWG, the expectations were very high, the previous Star Wars MMO had many flaws but it had many features very, VERY right. The crafting was deep, with stats to materials. A good crafter would go out on distant planets in remote locations to explore and gather excellent resources and could then make excellent weapons compared to another crafter. I still remember that one weaponsmith on my server, his name was known by all. I physically went to his shop, in the outskirts of Theed on Naboo (which was imperial and risky for rebel me) and I saw him, working on his machine, crafting weapons. We talked a little bit, I purchased my rifle and went on. SWG also had the best community I ever saw in a MMO. People would actually gather and talk, hunt, build cities and establish a government, go at the bar and share war stories, dance. RP was everywhere. PvP was cruel. We would go on enemy planets and simulate an attack on the enemy base where we'd have to extract one of our friend that was held prisoner. The imperials would then gather their troops and a battle would occur in the streets, with AT-ST, explosions, lasers everywhere. The game contained many of my most memorable gaming moments. It still lacked in many areas, it was very unbalanced, many features were fundamentally broken. I stopped before seeing the Jedi and I bid farewell to my friends. I still have the [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Kv0P0MN.jpg) (yes, my name comes from that game).

SWTOR had none of that. I don't even remember the crafting but I know it was nowhere near as deep. Many planets and areas were faction-restricted. A republican could never encounter and imperial enemy on Coruscant, there was never going to be raids in the opposite faction base, nor any fight on most planets. There was no housing and after SWG that one was quite a big hit. There was no real space combat, the tunnel shooter being a complete joke. I hear it was improved later. There wasn't even day/nigh and weather cycle. It was a step back on nearly every aspect but story, which wasn't too hard because SWG barely had a story (I say barely to be safe because I'm not sure if it even had a story). But even then, the story was told in typical BioWare fashion, with two people talking, standing in front of each other, barely moving and never changing expression. One quest-giver would say his children were missing and we'd have to find and rescue them and he was very sad, yet he would then stay in the very same place, standing still, doing nothing, waiting. The world was dead. I wrote a [big post](http://www.swtor.com/community/showthread.php?s=bda99bdf851bfb314d68e2a64686da8b&amp;t=216855) at the time. Some links are probably broken and hopefully some stuff was fixed, but it's a snapshot of the release.

Now, would SWTOR work as an action single player game? Maybe. It would remove a lot of the expectations regarding the community aspects and that would fix many of the problems above. That said, it would mean the rest of the features better be top notch. They would need to completely rework all NPC interactions and add actual animations and variance so it doesn't look like robots talking. They probably also could dump the cartoon graphics and overhaul the characters and worlds. The action combat part I'm not sure about. On one hand it would surely be better than the one at release but it would require work to balance it and making in challenging and not too easy.

But honestly I'd prefer a new MMO. It needs to get away from the old era and be included in the canon and the era of the movies. A discussion about that would be even longer so I don't want to start it and anyways I don't think it will ever happen. MMOs are not popular anymore and I can't remember the last big announce of a new one. I'm still playing Guild Wars 2 and it's good for me for now.",docwaoi,t3_76985r,,1,Games,,,2017-10-14

AnOnlineHandle,"&gt; What are you talking about? The new trailer reveals basically nothing about the plot.

That's what I said? It shows nothing new, it just shows the same characters and situations we've seen before, it might be the most uninspiring trailer that I can recall seeing in decades of the star wars franchise.

&gt; And how are walkers attacking something (you don't even know if it's a base) recycling plot?

Gee I wonder why anybody seeing a line of walkers attacking a base with a blast shield which Leia is standing in would worry that the plot might be a repeat of ESB, after how much TFA was a clone of ANH, down to the untrained jedi apprentice from the desert planet who found the droid and anakin's lightsaber practicing with the last jedi who is a grumpy old hermit.",doddzv2,t3_75dxvp,,1,StarWars,,,2017-10-14

Airaku,"It's interesting because I used to be 100% in the Plagueis camp until within the past year. There's a few things that no longer have me convinced.

1) Him not being a Muun is actually a huge blow to the current canon and Clone Wars. Change a scar is one thing, but a race is something else. Especially since his connection to the banking cartel will be rendered null. I mean I'm pretty sure the Clone Wars established it's Muun only and given Palpatine's awareness of the banking cartel if Plagueis was still involved I'm sure Palpatine would easily discover that. He was definitely out of the picture for those duration of Palpatine rise to power and reign. Rather he was regenerating or what, we don't know. The would need to be a ""body hopper"" to say the least and we don't know if Plagueis can do that nor have evidence that he can, but an ancient evil from the Old Republic era can.

2) The claim the Muuns look silly is only your opinion. I think that done right a darkside Muun can look as menacing as any other villain in Star Wars. Absolutely. Have you've seen the art work for Darth Plagueis for his novel? It's fantastic. Snoke to me in TLJ looks ugly, weak, lame, and laughable in terms of design. Unpleasing to the eye and ultimately he looks like he's someone's bitch. I took him seriously in TFA but after really seeing him in the last trailer I'm not feeling his design at all. He looks like a rich, white, high roller, playboy to me.


3) However the introduce Plagueis they need to make sure that he doesn't unline Anakin or Palpatine. In fact if it is Plagueis I don't really want him to be stronger than Palpatine, and honestly he doesn't need to be. There's no Anakin, the Jedi order is gone, Luke, Rey, Ben, The Resistance should be a match for him and the might of the New Order. Just because it takes place later in the timeline doesn't mean he has to be more powerful by default. It's not like it's DBZ where power levels always increase.

TheMastersSkywalker,"I grew up reading Legends. In fact you could say I grew up with Legends since heir to the Empire released a couple weeks before I was born.

I grew up watching Luke go on adventures and save the Galaxy time and time again. I grew up watching him rebuild the Jedi Order into something that was better than the one that came before it and made up for its mistakes. I grew up watching him have a loving family with Han Leia and their kids as well as his own wife and son.

So yes this Luke that was apparently hardly ever in contact with Leia and Han before he disappeared. This Luke whose Jedi Academy was destroyed. This Luke who is hidden on some out-of-the-way Planet not wanting to get involved in the fight especially one that involves he is nephew. This Luke who they're sitting up to be Yoda and a few are going to kill off just so the new Heroes can restart the order and save the Galaxy.

It is true I have problems with this new Luke and how they handle him in the last Jedi and episode one will make or break my connection to this new EU.

EPISODE VIII

THE LAST JEDI

Han Solo is dead! With Han Solo gone, Kylo Ren is confused and decides to join THE RESISTANCE while remaining in THE FIRST ORDER so he can provide intel to both sides cause he is literally that confused lmao

Meanwhile Luke Skywalker is on some island training Rey who has RAW, UNTAMED POWER and through her training, THE FORCE AWAKENS. But then Kylo Ren shows up and he's like ""Uncle Luke can you train me again"" and Luke's like ""Sure thing buddy"" which pisses Rey off so she turns to the dark side and reaches out to Snoke who gives her the title Kylo Rey. Meanwhile Luke tells Kylo Ren that he will be THE LAST JEDI. Then Luke turns to the dark side and becomes Darth Laser. Snoke is very pleased with this outcome of events.

Will THE RESISTANCE be able to defeat Darth Laser, Kylo Ren, and Kylo Rey? Probably not I mean they're hella strong and they've got hella midichlorians

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, rebel scum? I'll have you know I was the last Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, and I started the Clone Wars, and I have over 300 controlled solar sectors. I am trained in the Dark Side of the Force and I'm the top Sith in the entire Galactic Empire. Your planet is nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe it the fuck out with power the likes of which has never been seen before in this galaxy, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the holonet? Think again, Jedi. As we speak I am contacting my apprentice from across the galaxy and your rebel base is being traced right now so you better prepare for the 501st, Jedi scum. The 501st that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your rebel base. You're fucking dead, Jedi. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just without my lightsaber. Not only am I extensively trained in Dark Side combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the galactic Imperial stormtroopers and I will use them to their full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the galaxy, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" destruction of my Death Star was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have retreated your fucking X wing. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn rebel. I will shoot lightning all over you and you will drown in it.

SenatorConfer,"It actually makes sense when you think about it. Bail was always good friends with Yoda, so the thought of training his adopted daughter and the daughter of the Chosen One seems like a good idea.

Luke, on the other hand, wanted to join the Empire. Yes, it was to get off the planet, sure, but you're missing the bigger picture. Luke didn't have the drive to become a Jedi. He didn't want to moisture farm, he just wanted to fly and join the Academy.

Leia, from what Yoda knows, is the right choice. She isn't as headstrong as Anakin, she has a strong moral compass, and she was told by her father about the Jedi.

This isn't Lucasfilm throwing men to the side. It's showing why Yoda was wrong about wanting to train Leia. In RotJ, Yoda calls Luke the last of the Jedi. He gives him that title.

There are two sets of novels: the older ones that things like the new films, *Rebels* or *The Clone Wars* don't follow, only pull interesting things from on a individual basis. And the newer ones that are on the same level as the films or TV. Both are amazing. Here are some that might interest you:

 * Want to know what Luke originally did after *Return of the Jedi* (completely different from *The Last Jedi*), start with the *Thrawn Trilogy* of novels by Timothy Zahn. These stories (the older ones) are refered to as *Legends*.

 * Like Rebels a lot? Read *A New Dawn* by John Jackson Miller for Hera and Kanan, the *Kanan* comic book series for the titular character, and *Thrawn* by Timothy Zahn for that blue guy (and to make things even more confusing, this is not connected to the *Thrawn Trilogy* od *Legends*).

arcantiger,"Just remember one thing - all those leaks that know the color of Luke's saber, and that Luke's gone to the Dark Side and what not didn't know about Rey and Kylo's #RAWPOWAH. So that tells you all you need to know about their accuracy. They didn't know the main plot point which is that Rey and Kylo have #RAWPOWAH that scares the beejezus out of Luke. You know, the freakin word that has been repeated in the trailer by Luke and Snoke twice and you bet even more time in the movie. But they all saw the movie, right?

People in this sub and Leaks tend to crap on Jason Ward for his spoilers are mostly marketing-based and not plot-based. However, he was the first one to report that Luke was scared of Rey and he speculated for a long time that Rey and Kylo may be a new type of the Force User, neither Jedi nor Sith but something never seen before. Jason speculated about that last year based on JJ's quote that the Force Awakens referred to both Rey and Kylo. So he either paid really good attention or he camouflaged actual spoilers into speculation that proved to be on point. So, yeah, before people start taking unproven sources for granted, MSW is still #1 when you know where to look for information.

Beyond these stars exist other galaxies, other worlds, other beings. I will experience or ignore them as I wish. **I will spend eternity becoming everything: a farmer, an artist, a simple man.** When the last living thing in the universe finally dies, I will enjoy peace and wait for the cycle to begin again.""*

The Emperor's back story is less developed, but can be inferred based on lines in the movie. Obi-wan talks about how he was a Jedi before the Empire, implying that the Empire is a relatively new thing. Tarkin says the Emperor just dissolved the Imperial Senate and swept away the last remnants of the Republic. From both of these lines we can infer that The Emperor has probably been around since before the formation of the Empire and was probably a hugely instrumental figure in the downfall of the Republic. If you add on to this the opening lines of the novelization for A New Hope it straight up says the Emperor caused himself to be elected President of the Republic and then transformed it into an Empire.

*S2 E05: Landing at Point rain showcases some sweet battles on Geonosis, and reinforces why Ki-Adi-Minsk is the worst Jedi.

*S4 E11-13 showcases slavery and we get to see some great character development as well as some cool scenes.

*Lastly  S5 E17-20, the ""televised"" series finale shows how far the Jedi order has fallen when someone bombs the Jedi temple.


2 arcs of note deal with Yoda investigating the force, and a clone who has some issues that shed some light on why the clones immediately kill their Jedi generals when the order is issued, but those were Netflix exclusives.

Spike6958,"It really depends on how deep into each era we go, and how long they plan to support the game for.

Prequel Trilogy offers the most characters that could be added, Anakin, Obi-Wan, Dooku, Grievous, Mace Windu, Jango Fett, Padme, to name key characters from the movies. 
Even more if you also look to the Clone Wars series, with Ahsoka, Ventress, Captain Rex, Cad Bane. As well as the countless other Jedi Knights, however it makes the Jedi feel redundant if too many are included.

Sequel Trilogy doesn't have many. We're already getting Finn and Phasma, and outside of those it's really just Poe, Hux and Snoke who are big enough characters to warrant consideration. Of course that could also change after we see The Last Jedi.

As for the Original Trilogy, we have nearly everyone. Aside from adding the missing BF1 characters, Nien Nunb, Dengar and Greedo, it's a hard stretch to think of anyone. I've mentioned the possibility of Tarkin once or twice on here, as an enhanced officer class, but people seem torn on the idea.
Otherwise, it's looking to the other content of this era, been Rebels and Rouge One. 
Rouge One is likely as bringing Jyn and Krennic back wouldn't be too difficult a tast, and opens up the rest of the team for consideration.
Rebels is also probably the best place to draw OT era heroes from, not only do you have the entire crew of the Ghost, Hera, Ezra, Kanan, Sabine and Zeb. But it also gives a second chance to add Ahsoka, as well as other villains such as the Inquisitors and Thrawn, as well as Agent Kallus (though which side he should be placed on is up for debate).",doetvba,t3_76k7gf,,5.0,StarWarsBattlefront,,,2017-10-15

I think Kylo and Rey will be drawn to each other, not sure to what extent. That scene where Kylo reaches his hand out to Ray is interesting, but may be misleading.

Xallios,"Occam's Razor is not about pure simplicity, which means you don't understand it.

It's about the number of hoops you have to jump through, basically. You have to jump through more hoops to eliminate him being Plagueis than not.

Calling something laughable is just coming from this mentality of considering yourself intellectually superior. Instead of trying to be superior, really try to be logical and explain exactly what you mean and forget this image of being this smart logical professorial type that you probably have in your head.

Occam's Razor is not ""the simplest theory is probably correct."" It's ""the theory with the fewest and least major loose ends is most likely to be correct.""

There are no major loose ends with Plagueis theory, the biggest being Pablo's tweet denying it and he's signed a NDA, so he can't tell you what's actually going on.

Plus he has people pestering him about it day in and day out, so you don't even know where he's gone in his head being on that longwinded path of talking to people on the internet.

For the record, I'm working on a biophysics project involving C. elegans and have had a passion for analytic philosophy, classical art and classical music since I was a child. I've had my ego handed to me on a platter MANY a time in these areas, which is how I learned to get over myself, which resulted in my being more accurate.

I think there's probably less than a 99% chance that Snoke is Plagueis, realistically, but putting the pieces together in as concise of a way as possible is what leads me to believe that he probably is Plagueis.

I feel more confident in that after the release of the trailer. While confirmation bias is a thing, Plagueis theory did become slightly better after the trailer, which means that it may have some predictive power at this point. One thing you might predict is seeing Snoke regenerate if he's Plagueis. You might also predict similarities to Palpatine that go beyond their role, like Praetorian guards.

If he's an ancient sith, you might expect it to be somewhat different.

The other explanation for this is that they're just rehashing the old Star Wars movies more blatantly. But, if you haven't noticed, there's so much symbolism and cryptic stuff going on that it's really just unlikely that they'd do something so blunt.

There's symbolism to the ""rehashing"" and I think The Force Awakens is going to become a better movie in the context of The Last Jedi.",doek2ak,t3_763c6n,,3.0,starwarsspeculation,,,2017-10-15

Ark_Busse457,"That is possible. What I think is more likely, is that Rey is Luke's daughter. And she will bring ""balance to the Force"" but merging -- not joining -- with the Dark Side. You see, balance means equals parts of two sides. The Jedi nearly wiping out the Sith did not bring balance, and neither did the Sith nearly wiping out the Jedi. For balance, you need equality between the Jedi and the Sith.

Luke is the ""Last Jedi"" because there will be no more after him. And Snoke will be the last Sith, if he's killed and then Rey and Kylo Ren, who are cousins, join together and merge the teachings of both the Jedi and the Sith -- bringing balance to the Force. Thereby, the grandchildren of Anakin Skywalker will fulfill his destiny.

JediPaxis,"Rian Johnson has consistently said that he always thought of the title as being singular, but in English, it's ambiguous and it works both ways. As you said, Luke is called out as the last Jedi in The Force Awakens and he maintains that status into the beginning of TFL. We also know that Luke eventually trains Rey as a Jedi, so at some point in the film, the title can be interpreted as plural. Unfortunately, some translations of the title had to pick whether to make it singular or plural and don't have the same kind of ambiguous subtlety that the English title has. Technically both are correct, just in different ways and at different times. ",doerhyb,t3_76jx51,,2.0,StarWarsLeaks,,,2017-10-15

And even if they did choose to find other Jedi, then what? Risk being exposed and killed themselves, leaving luke to never find out about the Jedi and his own force abilities?

I know it's supposed to be laid to rest, but I wouldn't be shocked to see this end with something that changes the old sith vs jedi ideology and starts something less absolute, and we're supposed to question whether Luke is or isn't the last Jedi until the resolution of the trilogy.

Soxwin91,"As I said in another post, I don’t see this happening.

They had the original three leads back for TFA to varying degrees, with Luke being only a cameo.

Han dies in 7, leaving them only two,
Carrie Fisher tragically passed on, making 8 her last appearance.
This leaves Mark.

They couldn’t have predicted what happened to Carrie, but I can’t see them killing off Luke and having episode 9 devoid of an appearance from the original cast (in this case, reintroduction of Lando wouldn’t count since he was NOT one of the true original Big Three leads. Billy Dee Williams is awesome but it wouldn’t be the same.)

Harrison Ford wanted Han to die at the end of *Return of the Jedi*.

Luke has expressed no such feelings and in fact said being Luke again has been amazing. I can’t see Disney taking that away from him purely for shock factor. Han’s Death was well done but telegraphed by the press blitz — he was actually ***happy*** playing Han Solo!

Ren wants to follow in his grandfather's steps (Vader) and Snoke/Palpatine knows how important this is to him. Snoke/Palpatine is pitting Ren against Rey, just ask Palpatine and Vader battled in ROTJ. Snoke/Palpatine will at last have his vengeance on Skywalker/Vader when he kills his grandson, completing the cycle. Afterall, Rey utilizes the same forward thrust stab on her opening move the first time she handles the lightsaber against Ren. And the forward thrusting stab is the opening move the Emperor utilized against the Jedi when they attempted to arrest him. This is the reason why Luke had the forlorn look in his eye when Rey locates him at the end of The Force Awakens. He knows she probably is unaware of her familial history.

Look... his face is clearly fuller in the scene where he's presumably torturing Rey. Look at his left eye (your right) under the eye itself where there are cheek muscles.

Then, look at this right eye, at the area around his eye, especially on the side. Clearly it's filled out.

His face is DEFINITELY more put together in this one and when you get consistent, full shots of his face it's going to be really obvious.

glitter-squid,"Yeah I watched the prequels and 2/3 of the original trilogy because my girlfriend loves them but they weren't my thing. They're just SO corny! Like cringeworthy corny. I don't get it. I also somewhat preferred the prequels (except Anakin's sudden change plus the fact that pregnancy was apparently too hard for the doctors to deal with but Anakin can survive lava. Wtf.)

I didn't mind The Force Awakens as much. Still corny and the acting is stiff since that's the style of Star Wars but it was much better than the others. I'll probably watch The Last Jedi when it comes out.

I get this kind of ""angry because I don't like their fave"" response when I tell people I don't like cheese as well. People get like offended over it and also refuse to believe me. They say I just haven't found a cheese  I like yet. Nah I hate it all. I'm also really picky about textures because I'm autistic. I'm completely fine with my likes and dislikes but people lose their minds over it.",doerlqa,t3_76hu87,,0.0,TrollXChromosomes,,,2017-10-15
jayoduls,"No. Luke is the last Jedi. Rey and Kylo will team up, and become close -no romance- but close like the twins in the Knights of the Fallen Empire. They both will conquer, destroy everything both the first order, the resistance and the last remaining Sith. They will build their new empire. Luke will die of old age.",dodqrbt,t3_76fjo1,,0.0,StarWars,,,2017-10-15

m0hawk,"Time is the issue. I'm feeling burnt out by Star Wars atm, but I need to do my homework for Battlefront 2 and The Last Jedi by reading the essential bits from each new piece of canon. I would read everything if I could, but i simply dont have the time to do so. This method works for me, depending on the book.",doe62ra,t3_76hfga,,-1.0,starwarscanon,,,2017-10-15
Echo693,"I agree but shuold be last priority on their list. The main selling point in this game is the online content. Then comes the campaign, and last: skirmish. And let's be honest here - In years from now not a lot of people will play it, only a small community just like the case of the OG games

Again, it's imoortant to understand that this game (like any other DICE's games?) is mostly about it's online multiplayer. It's not like offline focused game like Republic Commando, Jedi Knight series or the open world SW game that is being developed as we speak.
