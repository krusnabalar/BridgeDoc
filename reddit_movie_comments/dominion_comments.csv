E.g. if you have...burger and fries on Fridays. Still have burger and fries, but make it vegan. Use beyond meat, vegan Richmond patties, impossible burgers, etc etc etc. And vegan cheese. Lots of vegan alternatives

Find substitutes for your favourite things fast too. This way you're not suddenly hit with ""aw I wish I could have XXX"" because you would have already have found and established alternatives.

JedExi,"1. Characters. By far DS9 had the best characters and the largest amount of actually fully developed characters in Star Trek. And it had continuous character growth which could be seen from episode to episode and season to season. And it did this with an insane amount of characters.
2. It challenges Roddenberry's vision while sticking very true to it. It wasn't just the Dominion War that did this. Starfleet/Federation perspectives were constantly challenged by others. The Bajorans, Ferengi, Cardassians, Maquis, ODO, etc etc. And sometimes their perspective ended up needing adjusting. I remember watching early TNG and thinking to myself, ""Huh, they barely know anything about the Ferengi and they're judging them so harshly. Harsh enough to the point where they were using them as a boogeyman to that guy in the first episode. Weird."" Federation bias gets brought up by Quark a lot and sometimes he's right. I think a lot of people did look down on the Ferengi overall which isn't right. The crew gets better at this though and the Ferengi end up changing overall too.
3. The Dominion. I loved how they were set up and elaborated on throughout the series. They're a mystery in most of Season 2 and even after the Founders are revealed in Season 3, there's still so much to learn about them. They don't just invade with a fleet, they sowed chaos in the Alpha Quadrant and weakened it before even moving in. And even when they did move in, they didn't just attack everyone. No, they ""helped"" the Cardassians against the Klingons and Maquis. Remember those Maquis that existed? They basically don't now. The Klingons get slapped hard AND the Cardassians are under control by the Dominion, even if they don't know it. It takes a long WHILE to get to the actual Dominion War and I love that. It's so developed and well fleshed out where I feel other shows fail with their intergalactic wars. Discovery season 1 had a war that started in an episode and was done by the end of the season. It lacked all of the fleshing out that DS9 did and because of that it was really, REALLY bad for me. I think Babylon 5 did good with the Narn and Centauri and some of the build up to the Shadow Wars, but the actual War itself was meh. 79 Gundam did a great job of portraying the war without the build up, but other Gundams don't do nearly as good as portraying war.
4. I love all the old Trek love. Blood Oath, Once More Unto the Breach, Trials and Tribbleations, little easter eggs like hearing about TAS references and TOS references. From what I understand, TOS was sort of the ""do not talk about mostly"" thing in the writers room for TNG and it kinda shows. Aside from McCoy, The Naked Now, Sarek/Spock, and Scotty I can't think of many references to TOS. Heck, I feel the only episode that actually shows love for it is the Scotty one. McCoy is basically just there to ""pass on the torch"" and then get the fuck out lmao.",hwdmris,t3_sp51te,/r/DeepSpaceNine/comments/sp51te/what_makes_ds9_the_best_of_the_star_trek_series/hwdmris/,15,DeepSpaceNine,False,0,2022-02-10

\-Yes Book! Maybe flying off like this without a plan with this guy you barely know was a BAD IDEA  
\-I know its an old complaint at this point but when Vance and Burnham are talking in her quarters I’m really struck again by just how uncomfortable this all looks to live in. Especially compared to the TNG era, I can’t like…imagine sitting on one of these couches, reading a book under these lighting conditions.

\-Burnham, you’ve been in the future for like a year, how do you have any “old friends”?  
\-But I do love any time we get to go back and see what this show thinks “a dirty underworld” looks like. Its cute, like seeing a kid dress up as a mobster.   
\-This makeup job is incredible for someone we’re going to see for at most a couple appearances. And this is hilarious tabletop RPG-style writing, just classic sidequest “I need to sniff out these card counters to get the item I need” shit  
\-I…don’t understand the drama of this scene with Michael and Owosekun. They came here looking for Book. Its super obvious that Book is the other bidder. Why does Owosekun act like that’s a reveal?  
\-Hugh…its admirable that he’s been trying to be a therapist this season, but I think this confrontation is pointing out that he’s actually pretty underqualified for this. Real therapists do get some training, or at least develop experience, to at least try and grapple with this exact issue.   
\-Wait like a changeling changeling?? You can’t just drop stuff like that in here! What happened to the Dominion??  
\-Owosekun being a shark is a pretty fun twist, but a real casino would be…quite upset about that maneuver.

knope2018,"Theory is that ""end of the Jurassic era"" and future of the franchise is they are basically doing Planet of the Apes

The key plot points of this largely come from the trailer (eg the locusts and dialog from Claire and Malcom), and that in media pieces BioSyn has been compared to Monsanto.

IRL Monsanto is out to get a monopoly on seeds and the food supply.

BioSyn ha the same goal. But they are using InGen genetic tech towards it. Wu made the locusts for them, and BioSyn is releasing them to eat crops that aren't BioSyn seed strains (see the kids running from the homestead from the cloud of them.)  With locusts wiping out non BioSyn food you have to buy from them.  Ellie, because of her husband's ties at State department and her expertise in botany, is investigating this, and from there drags Grant and Malcom in to investigating BioSyn.  We see them arriving at a big Apple Park Cupertino style facility in helicopter. 

Meanwhile BioSyn is after baby raptor and Masie for whatever mad science reasons, point is get the JW team to the facility where chaos erupts, including but not limited to a plane crash as the JW team arrives.

Oooh! Ahhh! That's how it always starts. Then later there's running and screaming. 

Anyways, we see it wraps up with the massive fires in the background as the facility is destroyed and the Giga is coming from shadows, important part is facility is wrecked.

This lets the locusts loose without a way to recall or control them.

""We created an ecological disaster""

Locusts go off and start eating all the food supply for humans.  

""We are racing towards the extinction of our species.  We not only lack dominion over nature, we are subordinate to it""

No food means civilization collapse.  Future films will be humans on more ""equal footing"" facing more and more dinosaurs, without our technology to help us.

End of the Jurassic era, start of the new Planet of the Apes/Dinosaurs style franchise


To be clear, this is 100% my speculation based only on my seeing the trailer, having read a lot of Crichton books, and following Hollywood reasoning.

wigglebork_72,"and a deep, complex and intersectional rabbit hole it is...

but without writing a dissertation - yes, economic stratus is a component.  generational poverty keeping people clinging to the edge of subsistence living diminishes the ability to care about anything but your own or your family's survival.

overwhelmingly, though, what I see across socioeconomic levels is, for lack of a better word, ""othering"" of animals.  I don't really know if it's a product of the mentality of ""dominion over animals"" or willful ignorance or some combination of the two.   It's ""just"" a dog, cat, horse, it can't feel pain, doesn't feel affection, if it was meant to live, God would will it so.  I've seen people who could buy and sell me 10x over keep dogs in kennels outside their whole lives, minimal, if any, vet care and if they die, well that's what they do.  They aren't a human, so they aren't worthy.

Jurassic World being a rehash and reboot of sorts like the Force Awakens was

Fallen Kingdom and the Last Jedi being polarizing and very differently tonally than the film before it

Than finally Dominion is bringing legacy characters into the film and showcased as this grand finale not just for the it’s own trilogy but the whole franchise like Rise of Skywalker was

It doesn’t give me any hope that they had an idea how to bring the Jurassic Park franchise back and create a storyline for all three films.

atb743,"I mean generally the ecumenical creeds are accepted as a representation of Christian orthodoxy. But that doesn't mean we follow them blindly. There are multiple Scripture references that point us toward this interpretation. Here are a few:

""Your father Abraham was overjoyed that he would see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced."" So the Jews said to Him, ""You are not yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?"" Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am."""" (John 8:56-58). While conversing with with the parishes in the temple Jesus claims the I AM title, which is to claim the title of Yahweh. The Jews understood this perfectly as claiming the power, history, and glory of God for himself, which is why they attempted (unsuccessfully) to stone him.

""For in Him [Christ] all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form"" (Colossians 2:9). Jesus isn't half of God, or a lesser part of God, the *fullness* of deity dwells in him in bodily form. 

""And I heard every created thing which is in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, or on the sea, and all the things in them, saying, “To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion forever and ever"""" (Revelation 5:13). Jesus is glorified and honored equally with God. There is no subordination seen here. Jesus isn't giving homage to the Father, he is receiving the *exact* same praise that the Father receives.",hwbnb3u,t3_somvf8,/r/TrueChristian/comments/somvf8/what_do_you_mean_by_jesus_is_god/hwbnb3u/,10,TrueChristian,False,0,2022-02-10

skingrad_city_guard,"I have, and I don’t think it applies here. From the lens of the Imperial counts, the Emperor, and his advisors, the Dominion is still strong. Because they have no spies, they have no way of knowing that the Aldmeri army is mostly defeated. Also, the people were likely sick of war. Maybe the Nords weren’t, but the Nords hadn’t suffered years of intense fighting and unimaginable horrors.

Although the lives that were lost (the “sunk cost”) could not be regained, there were still countless lives that would exist and that did exist (the “prospective cost” that continuing the war would likely bring.) 

Even if the war was continued and the army was rebuilt with Nords, Redguards, and Bretons (and the few Imperials still capable of going to war), Cyrodiil would bear the brunt of any potential counter invasions from the Khajiit and Bosmer, who’s lands the Legion would be assaulting. There was also a potential for great victory, or even annexation of the mainland territories of the dominion.

Avery Brooks is an amazing actor, full stop. Yeah sure it’s great to tout he was the first black captain. I don’t have an issue with that.

But garek-bashir? FOH. the homoerotic tension /jokes /puns between those characters, esp. in Garek’s first episode, was hilarious because it was subtle and underplayed. They also both have way more important plots in the show than their sexual issues.

This is why today’s obsession with forcing identity on people is so stupid.. instead of having characters who happen to be gay or bi but that’s not the most important thing about them, and they get into far more interesting plot lines - like oh I don’t know fighting the DOMINION?!  - today’s tv shows act like external and sexual identities is the absolute most urgent important thing that viewers need to see. I literally couldn’t care less.

Ironically the only characters whose sexuality is not aggressively foregrounded on tv is straight people 🤔 this is why I really see wokeness as aggressively regressive.

CatOfRivia,"Nah, the actual full quote says: ""Galadriel, like all the other names of elvish persons in The Lord of the Rings, is an invention ofmy own. It is in Sindarin form (see Appendices E and F) and means 'Maiden crowned with
gleaming hair'. It is a secondary name given to her in her youth in the far past because she had long
hair which glistened like gold but was also shot with silver. She was then of Amazon disposition
and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats."" 

It says at the time of her receiving Galadriel nickname in the First Age she was Amazon. It doesn't say she was no longer Amazon in the Second Age. You can interpret that her Amazon days ended in the end of the First Age but that's just your interpretation and the way od reading. 

But even then, Second Age Galadriel is also said to be in her youth for some reason: ""It was not until two long ages more had passed, when at
last all that she had desired in her youth came to her hand, the Ring of
Power and the dominion of Middle-earth of which she had dreamed,
that her wisdom was full grown and she rejected it,"" - Unfinished Tales

As is clear here Tolkien is referencing to the time of SA Galadriel as her 'youth'. Since The Ring of Power was forged in the mid Second Age. And here it is stated Galadriel desired the Ring of Power since her youth. 

In any case, Galadriel is specifically stated as a commander, many times, in Eregion. And even if we ignore all the mentions of Galadriel as a commander of Eregion and war trainer of Dwarves, there's still the fact that all female Elves could fight when they needed to (as is stated in Morgoth's Ring and in the Letters).",hwfizuy,t3_spfil9,/r/lotrmemes/comments/spfil9/but_galadriel_doesnt_fight/hwfizuy/,8,lotrmemes,False,0,2022-02-10

sue_donyem,"1. My question is, how many people assume you’re an “Aldmeri” spy? I know the Dunmer are not part of the Dominion, but how frequently do they lump you in with the other elves? What do you do to correct their misconceptions?

Not too often. I tend to shy away from extremists and racists, though it does happen. More often than not my husband is close by to raise a stink. I'm not a spy. I'm too busy at the mill to be a spy.

2. Also, as I’m curious, how is the relationship with your stepdaughter? 

It's fine. Her birth mother was killed by wolf, and I'm obviously no replacement to her, I try to be there for her as often as I can be.
I've sewn her dresses and every month we travel into town for holiday, but she's becoming a rebellious teenager, so I'm probably going to teach her to hunt with her father this summer when the weather warms.

I know she loves me. When her mother died, she was very young. Too young to process such a loss. I've taught her to read, I try to teach her math and history every day.

It’s a parasitic tyranny, taxing resources and money and offering no protection in return. Do people realize how insane that is? Outlawing a religion and allowing a foreign nation to waltz around as they please murdering your own citizens? There is absolutely NOTHING that justifies a government making a decision like that.

starch12313,"&gt;25 years is longer than the period between WWI and WWII and more than enough time for a new generation to fill the void in manpower lost.

Yea its almost as if the US had a substantially larger population. Something that not only helps the rebuilding process, but helps in acquiring manpower. Oh wait, its also as if the world of Tamriel predominantly lives in a pre industrial revolution age. An age that greatly impacted all aspects of warfare lol.

The implication that 25 years is enough. Is refuted by the notion that even the Dominion has not built up their military to where they could start another war.

&gt;If the Empire truly still lacked the manpower to declare war on the Thalmor again, what business did they have fighting the Civil War in Skyrim and spilling both Imperial and Nord blood?

Because Skyrim is a part of their territory. Likewise, you speak of manpower, as if the entirety of the empire is involved in the civil war. Not only are most of the legion on the border facing the dominion, but most of the fighters in Skyrim are locally recruited. I.E if you missed it, a CIVIL WAR. 

So if the Empire actually decided to send in more of its soldiers, the fight would be over rather quickly.

Likewise, I love how you talk about spilling Nord blood, as if it isnt Nord vs Nord lol.

&gt;Let Skyrim peacefully divorce under good terms, and in 5 or 10 or whatever years when the Empire decides it has enough manpower again, send a delegation to Skyrim to negotiate an alliance against the Thalmor.

Aside from your poor optimism of Skyrim working with the Empire, when they would be ruled by Ulfric. This is a civil war for a reason. This isnt like Hammerfell where the entire province agreed on leaving the Empire. Only a part of Skryim wants to leave, whereas the rest dont.

Your poor attempt of arguing for ""why not just give Skyrim their freedom"", is refuted by the very fact that this is again, a civil war lol.

&gt;Ulfric shouldn't have made a stink about the unenforced ban on Talos worship, but after that the ball was firmly in the Empire's court.

And what do you want the Empire to do? Continue to turn a blind eye to the worshipping of Talos, despite the Thalmor now being in Skyrim? You do realize what this would lead to right? This would lead to the war starting again, and unlike the Empire. The Dominion doesnt have to worry about a civil war in one of their provinces. So despite not being at their full might, they would still be at an advantage. If they win, there will be no treaty being signed, instead you would see mass genocide for all of the Empires provinces, yes and that includes Skyrim.

Honestly its as if people dont really think these things through lol. Here let me help you out here.

There are 18 legions in the Empire. All of them consist of 5000 soldiers. At the end of the Great war, 3 legions were destroyed, and no legion had more than half of their manpower. This means that they only had 37,500 soldiers left, and thats disregarding the fact that they are all not in tip top condition.

Despite being in such a poor state, they're able to handle the civil war in Skyrim with one legion, and the local residents lol. Your poor optimism on Skyrim being able to tango with the Empire, let alone the Dominion if they were to become independent is humorous.",hwbmlrf,t3_soou1l,/r/skyrim/comments/soou1l/skyrim_belongs_to_the_nords/hwbmlrf/,7,skyrim,False,0,2022-02-10

sharkylazor,"im an old school no gods no masters atheist. i believe that a truly democratic society is probably impossible so long as the vast majority of the decision making population believe *eternity* is on the line when making decisions. i agree with bakunin that belief in a god or gods is precursor to belief in masters on earth (""if god were real, it would be necessary to abolish him""), and the majority of 19th century anarchists in seeing ""capital, the state, and the church"" as the holy trinity. gelderloos wrote a chapter in worshiping power about how the second most common precursor to stateless societies becoming states (after patriarchy), were salvation religions, which were required for the concept of ""surplus"".

im against the abrahamic religions for fueling endless wars, for being the foundation of humanity's destruction of the biosphere (thru procreation and the natural ""dominion"" of man over nature and non-human animals), as well as some hindu and NA indigenous people for relying on theistic beliefs to allow them to murder non human animals. i resent buddhism and daoism for encouraging people to just let the masters do whatever they want, and every religion with an afterlife for encouraging people to resign themselves to whatever lot theyve been given since this life is only a means to an eternal end anyway.

i resent astrology for confusing the reasons conditions are what they are (capitalism is the reason you're suffering, not the position of the moon). i generally feel theism is a major block towards us collectively confronting the problems that need to be confronted in a meaningful way, while witchcraft similarly distracts us from taking meaningful action.

still, im generally ultra tolerant of people and whatever silly things they believe. but this is anon reddit, so i figured it was important to voice this criticism here.",hwbpfa7,t3_sov55s,/r/Anarchism/comments/sov55s/for_any_of_you_does_your_particular_religious_or/hwbpfa7/,6,Anarchism,False,0,2022-02-10

dipdotdash,"If you think about what the authors were trying to achieve, this would have been an obvious consequence of success in the long run. Reading the Bible from the perspective of someone that's never been to Church, it reads like a manual for uniting groups of people toward a common goal. There would have been plenty of history of collapse as a result of successful empires reaching overshoot, and, if this book guides the world, it's safe to assume that giving its readers ""dominion over all things"" would eventually result in collapse. They were just smart enough to predict what would happen if the book wasn't lost to time. 

Any talk about the Bible makes me wonder how many similar texts have existed that have been lost to time, ironically through some kinda biblical evolution. Maybe there was a bible about striving for sustainability and peace rather than jealousy, revenge, and war.

75DW75,"You should definitely get a ""pocket dimension"" of your own.

DC Occult has the Dimension lord.   20k squaremiles is a decent bit of land to start with.   Another option is Scooby gamers Pocket world(along with instructions how to create them).

Generic super academy has Pocket dimensions, which is also very good.

Dark lord of Derkholm has Pocket universe.

You can create your own magical dimension by using D&amp;D or Pathfinder classes as well as the Jobless class from the Jobless jump.

If needed, put everything together with one of the perks/items that lets you combine any of your lands together in any way you prefer.

Then go to Generic island castaway, get the biggest, nicest island you can, then in future jumps have it added to the dimension.   Size of Australia is the limit, but with how NICE you can make it in the builder, drastically better.   Especially as it will be populated with somewhat superhuman people loyal to you.

You can buy a planet in Starcraft Protoss.

Humanity Fuck Yeah! can provide you with the whole GALAXY...   The Demon princes can give you an uninhabited starsystem.

There's the star nation builders in Generic Star Wars fanfiction and Honor Harrington jump.   Against the gods has the Leaping bouncing nation.   Dominion from Endless pantheon gives you 25 habitable planets in a total of 40 starsystems.

Oasis of fantasy can give you quite a big and VERY nice ""kingdom"".

You can get a copy of Australasia from Generic Australian.

And so on...   Basically, pick an option to set up your personal dimension, pick one of the options to add stuff to it as you prefer when going to a new jump, then add as much of the larger purchases as you want to it.   Making it a whole planet would be impressive.   If you take that whole galaxy to add, and then make sure to have one of the perks/items that makes resources on your lands endless, hehehe...   :)

Cook_0612,"I mean, I guess I always knew it was WWII-esque in tone, but I never actually tried to match it to specifics. Could be fun.

Because the show is American we can assume the Federation represents America, even though it would be a highly mythologized America that didn't, y'know, sit out most of the war from a position of relative safety. That one's pretty shaky, but I don't know who else would be America-- Romulus? They make a big deal of adding the Romulans to the alliance, but it doesn't seem to *really* play that big of a deal, and the Romulans aren't spending most of the war sitting on an economy bigger than everyone else combined, pretty much. Romulan money also isn't underwriting the galactic financial system, eh, that doesn't work either. Ok, let's forget about them then. 

What about the bad guys? If the Dominion is Nazi Germany, that'd make the Cardassians, I dunno, Russia? That doesn't really work very well either, to be honest, since the Cardassians are kinda also Nazis. Maybe the Cardassians are Italy.

Atma-Stand,"Soul Protection is a must in my opinion, so my suggestion is to first stop at jumps that give that like [Ghost Rider](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1clHufYlBNZtPfxL4IHEm_yU73cWwzgNK/view), [Castlevania Less Rough](https://i.4pcdn.org/tg/1412998711376.pdf), or [Naruto Fanfic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14cvqk7jlOzplBQER26WMDxkyRe7j5NOp/view). 

* **I Have no Soul To Burn (-200 CP, Discount Demon) --** Demons are soulless beings; however, in your case that might be problematic. So, instead your soul will, essentially, become a nonentity- it can’t be attacked, stolen, burned, destroyed, possessed, trapped, detected etc. unless you sell or otherwise remove it from your body, including putting/turning it into a physical object, or if for some reason you want others to interact with it. **It’s important to note that these protections only apply to your soul since you, as a demon, are able to absorb souls (not directly; they need to be given willingly) to increase your own power. If you’ve already absorbed souls over the course of your adventures, they will be included in this protection. If you absorb souls afterwards, then they will not be protected until you’ve completed the Jump you absorbed them in.** If someone attacks your unprotected souls, either to damage, destroy, remove, or otherwise harm them, then you may also be damaged by proxy; your protected souls(s) will still be fine. If you die from whatever they did, then your protected soul is fine; however your chain will end, or you’ll otherwise pass on. If you don’t die, than your protected soul is still fine; your other souls may not be.
* **Power of Dominance (-800 CP, General Perk No Discount) --** Somehow, you have gained a measure of the Dark Lord's own power. **Any time you slay an inhuman creature, you may attempt to gain mastery over its soul. The weaker the creature is, the more easily it will yield - the strongest may hurt or even kill you unless you relinquish your claim.** With this power comes an additional boon - you gain absolute dominion over your own soul, and none may attempt to harm or claim it without your consent.
* **True Name (-500 CP General Perk, No Discount) --** Whoa, Okay, this is some deep stuff man. Something happened. Maybe it was a great ques, some memories from another life maybe you glimpsed something mankind was not supposed to see. However it happened, you have discovered your true name. This is the truth of who you are, all of it, the summation of every you that ever was, could have been, will be or might be. And knowing it grants you quite a bit of power over yourself. 
   *   Firstly, this means that's it no longer possible to drive you mad or corrupt yo, even things that would normally find it trivial. You know yourself. No matter what actions you might perform, what you may witness or may be exposed to, your True Name remains the core and truth of you and all else just slides off leaving you unmarred. The same effect also shield your soul from any and all attacks whether it be mundane or magical, from a petty torturer or celestial spirit. Your soul, sense of self and willpower are absolute, boundless and inviolable, come what may. **Neither can your True Name be used against you or knowledge of it passed onto others save by your own will and desire.**   
   * Beyond this, truly knowing yourself places your heart at ease and lets you draw out more of it from within you. Simply by meditating upon your True Name you find that your soul grows ever-so-stronger, growing richer for the experience, and immensely benefiting your comprehension of all things related to your mind, soul or spirit. Finally, your enlightenment will avoid the traps of stasis or hubris; from now on your soul will develop only for the better and never for the worse as you walk the road towards the better you, the you that you really wish to be. No more self-deception, no more blind alleys.

So, there's a little something to each perk that makes each just a touch different and worth buying. Special mention goes to Ghost Rider though, as there are alot of perks there that will make your time in 40K easier between the Priest line that makes pretty anathemic to demons, to the Rider perk line, which has willpower boosts and the Penance Stare. Take the capstone booster and the capstone  perks for either (or both if you the CP) and you'll be breaking demons in no time.",hwdz87s,t3_sp9n3q,/r/JumpChain/comments/sp9n3q/wh40k_defence_package/hwdz87s/,6,JumpChain,False,0,2022-02-10
Saramello,"The war of 1812 goes abysmally for the U.S. Napoleon succeeds in fleeing to America after the disaster in Russia. The British demand extradition, and the U.S, high on jingoism, refuses. Not willing to let two decades of war and cash burning to waste, the British land in devastating numbers. The U.S. Navy is deleted over night, their armies crushed over and over again, their cities burned. 

The fragile American Experiment falls apart. Desperate to jump off the sinking ship, states secede left and right. The federalist northern states, terrified of suffering the same obliteration of Washington DC and other southern cities, throw themselves at their mercy, and become a British protectorate.

The peace terms were one-sided. The federalist North from New York to far Massachusetts (Maine) rejoin the British Empire. The former borders of Quebec (the entire American Great Lakes region) is restored. The following years sees Canada extend unperturbed across the northern half of North America, bordering the Mexican Empire. The Lakotah lands, Cascade Mountains, and all of the Oregon territory become part of the growing collection of Canadian colonies. Through a long process the Canadian provinces were consolidated into a Single Dominion. After WW1 Canada demanded de facto independence for their pivotal role in defeating the Central Powers, providing a great chunk of the resources, industry, and manpower. This was accepted (without choice) from the weak British government. by WW2, despite isolationism, the attack on Fox Harbor by the Japanese brought the Canadians back on the side of their former master.

The main plot of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is that the High Elf government, the Aldmeri Dominion with their enforcers, the Thalmor, outlawed Talos worship, resulting in a civil war between the Empire of Cyrodil, who agreed with the Elves to avoid another Great War, and the Stormcloaks, who oppose the decision and want the Empire out of their homeland.

Jonny_Guistark,"My ""in-universe"" answers:

The Akaviri are overwhelmingly hostile to the nations of northern and eastern Tamriel. All of the Empire’s major enemies are in the south/southwest. I don’t believe negotiation with them would be viable or likely, and inviting them to bring a powerful force would be a huge mistake. 

The Maormer are ancient enemies to the Altmer and have rivaled them before in power. They do have a long history of raiding Tamriel’s shores besides just Summerset, that is still mostly restricted to the south, which the Dominion controls. I don’t think they would get along particularly with the Empire, but they should make for natural allies in a conflict to topple any major Altmeri regime. Whatever damage their involvement might do to Cyrodiil would be nothing compared to what they’d inflict on Alinor.

From what I understand of them, the sload seem unlikely to ally with any Tamrielic factions, and if they do, they should be kept at a distance and not trusted whatsoever. They will go to extreme lengths and resort to horrific methods, and so bringing them into the conflict is something that should only be done if the Empire fears or hates the Dominion to such an extent that they are willing to become culpable in some truly terrible atrocities in order to beat them.

Morrowind hates the Empire and has little reason to prefer them over the Aldmeri Dominion. They also have their own problems to focus on, like the strengthening of their nation and potential threats from the An-Xileel. I don’t see them getting involved unless they get attacked first. And even then, their retaliation would more likely involve sending assassins to kill someone important than allying with the Empire.

An independent Skyrim and Hammerfell are both reasonable contenders. They have the same enemies and similar goals. They don’t like Cyrodiil, but they don’t want to be its enemies either. I think either would be a likely ally should another war break out.

My ""out-of-universe"" answer:

Yes, TES needs more politics with new alliances and factions. And a scenario where the Empire in desperation reaches out to groups who by rights should be their enemies has lots of potential for good storytelling. I’d like to see it happen with the Maormer for sure, and an attempt to be made with the Sload only for it to backfire.",hwk0f0y,t3_sq7azg,/r/teslore/comments/sq7azg/should_the_4e_empire_ally_with_the_enemies_of/hwk0f0y/,13,teslore,False,0,2022-02-11

MattCW1701,"&gt;\-Wait like a changeling changeling?? You can’t just drop stuff like that in here! What happened to the Dominion??

800 years have passed since the Dominion. That's one complaint I have about seasons 3 and 4. We're told this is 900 years in the future, but all the writing is like this is happening 100 years later, like this is to TNG what TNG was to TOS. To put it into perspective, 800 years ago, Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire! Moveable type printing was ***invented.*** Yet how often do we still hear about things that happened in the 23rd and 24th centuries? If the powers that be had any sense, they would at least map out those 800 years so it's consistent and the writers could pull things from that timeline. Frankly, it's astounding that the Federation maintained itself as closely to what we see in the 24th century. We got a hint that it hadn't with the ""V'drayash"" or however they spelled it early in S3, but that seemed to be quickly dropped. It would have been more interesting to have seen something like a ""Glactic Coalition"" evolve out of the Federation, or the Federation have amicably fragmented into a number of hegemonies before the FTL of the time could keep up with the expansion. Throw the burn on top of that, and now you have up to a dozen regions that in being reconnected, still want to maintain peaceful relations, but also each vying for the ""border"" regions between them. That alone could have generated political, action, and personal intrigue without another season-long super-galactic threat!

10567151,"&gt;  I'm talking specifically after he beat Naito at Dominion in 2016 , he was criticized for fans, press and even several wrestlers keept making fun of Okada's body and talent, like he didnt look, acted or deserve to be the champion

Nope, this was in no way true in any shape or form. In 2016, Okada was HIGHLY acclaimed by critics, people who cover pro wrestling in Japan and wrestlers themsleves recognized what a wunderkind Okada was. Most online critics rated his matches very high, go and see the ratings Okada was getting on cagematch back then, go look at the Match of the year lists from voices of pro wrestling and see the comments people would leave talking about Okada. Okada won the wrestler of the year award THREE times before 2016 from Tokyo Sports Magazine, which is the most reputable pro wrestling news coverage in Japan. Genichiro Tenryu, a HUGE star in the 90s when pro wrestling was it's absolute peak in Japan, chose Okada to retire him, it was a huge deal. Imagine Undertaker specifically choosing someone from ANOTHER company to retire him, it was like that. 

Do I think Okada got no criticism whatsoever? Of course not, but those voices against Okada in 2016 would very much be the minority. I don't know what threads or where you were discussing wrestling back in 2016 but it was clearly a group trying to go against the grain from what I can tell.

&gt; Even nowadays, some people around press, forums, keep saying that he's not a star but just some random lucky dude who was helped by Omega in some ""overrated"" matches in Japan.
 
Let me guess those exact same people probably couldn't tell the difference between ""in Japan"" and ""in NJPW"". Now of course people who stick to their American pro wrestling bubble are going to know jack and shit about who is a star in Japan or not. By 2016 Okada was a certified draw, the 2nd biggest in Japan after Tanahashi I would say.

ChloeMomo,"For sure! So one of my favorite books overall that isn't pro-vegan (there is one chapter that supports fur trapping, be warned) is *Braiding Sweetgrass*. It changed my life, not exaggerating. The author is balancing indigenous knowledge with western biology education, and the tension and perspective is incredible. One of my favorite quotes from it is ""if you were cutting down a tree and you referred to her as a 'she' rather than an 'it'...wouldn't you think twice?"". She says it more eloquently, but the idea that this earth isn't below us is so prevalent and beautifully written throughout.

If you want an insane POW of a vegan book that's a bit dense but covered economics, health, and ethics...I can't recommend ""Meatonomics"" enough. It's the book that convinced me to go to law school for farmed animals (written by a lawyer). It has one of the most graphic depictions of a slaughterhouse from a worker that I've ever heard and would argue rivals Dominion despite only being words on a page, but once you get through the ethics section he lays out the insane costs and instability out so well it's hard to believe anyone who reads it would support animal ag.

A very dry but brilliant book on animal cognition is ""Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?"". Be warned it's dry. Like very dry. But it is sources practically to the sentence and is AMAZING on evaluating humans ego and the problems we have in looking at animals because we come from a baseline assumption that they are inferior, so we miss the incredible emotionally and intellectual intelligence they have because, even in science, we limit our interpretation to something inferior to ourselves.

Really there's not one on that shelf I wouldn't recommend, but those might be my top three to cover a variety of things. If you are an activist and work with people with traditional notions of human superiority or have a more Christian religious approach to their relationship with animals, I recommend reading Dominion. It's a brilliant approach to why even those with conservative thoughts and values (or those who think empathy and compassion are inferior to intellect and logic) should be vegan. It's an anthropocentric approach to why we still shouldn't hurt animals. Kinship and Killing is also an interesting look at how religion influences our view of animals and vice versa.",hwkn1pf,t3_sqaggs,/r/vegan/comments/sqaggs/im_pretty_proud_of_my_bookshelf/hwkn1pf/,9,vegan,True,0,2022-02-11

sp1ke0kill3r,"Fellow amateur here

What is academic orthodoxy?



Markan priority is a virtual certainty. See Mark Goodacre [here](http://www.markgoodacre.org/Q/fatigue.htm)

Yes, there are arguments for John being early and if I understand the hypothesis correctly, it is based on the idea of proto gospels where each was borrowed from the others see u/kromem [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/oaujmj/a_problem_with_editorial_fatigue_looking_closer/)

There's an interesting argument made by Evan Powell that Mark was written as a response to what he refeers to as ur-John, if memory serves it goes something like this, John the son of zebedee, probably the source for ur-john, blamed Peter for Judas
betrayal. This involves reading references like ""Judas the son of simon iscariot"" (John 6:70-71) as alluding to Peter being the father of Judas betrayal

&gt; Another interesting point I've seen raised is that the suggestion of a post 70 AD date for the Gospel doesn't make much sense considering there is no reference, or even inference, to the destruction of the 2nd Temple...


Isn't Mark 13's little apocalypse such a suggestion?

The way Ive seen that argument presented by apologists is that the destruction of the temple marked a fulfillment of
Jesus  ""Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down.” remarks and would have been a bragging point so to speak and would be a good reason for the evangelists to mention it. As with all apologetics  the claim is not examined beyond its value as a talking point. Notably, if we take for granted that Jesus said what the evangelists attribute
to him, there are a number of problems with the idea that Jesus prediction came true. For one, the son of man does not arrive on the clouds of heaven. Further, the destruction of the Temple and sacking of Jerusalem established the very opposite of Jesus expectations: The dominion of Rome rather than God.In this context the olivet discourse *could* be read as trying to explain this reversal by setting it as ""the beginning of the birth pangs"".  Another problem is the statement offers no specifics tying this prediction to the events in question, not even an allusion to the destruction of the temple by evil forces. Surely, **if** jesus was offering divine foreknowledge, it's hard to see why he would not mention or even allude to this crucial detail. To be sure, if Mark is post 70, shouldn't he have made it part of that prediction? Further, apologetists don't weigh this in terms of apocalyptic Judaism. If Jesus was an apocalyptic Jew and thought the Temple was corrupt, it's entirely possible that he would expect the establishment of of God's dominion to include the Temple's destruction and its replacement with a new one.   The issue gets even more complicated if we ask if Jesus actually said this.  u/lost-in-earth 
recently posted a very interesting argument that he did [not](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/sj92gb/if_the_historical_jesus_preached_that_the_temple/)

Of course, while ambiguity and doubt are part of and even useful for critcal scholarship, they don't work very well for putting fannies in pews.

&gt;&gt; From my understanding, the debate primarily revolves around high/low Christology. However, the suggestion that High Christology MUST be later in development doesn't seem to play out, in my opinion, as it relates to the earliest writings of the early Christians, like Paul

First, the expression high and low christolgies refer to various things. If Paul had a high christology, it doesn't follow that he had John's high christology. So, for example, Bart Ehrman, in his book, How Jesus Became God, changed his mind about
high christologies needing to be [later](https://ehrmanblog.org/early-christology-how-i-have-changed-my-mind-for-members/)

&gt;&gt;In these posts I have been arguing that there were two separate streams of early Christology (this too has been a major shift in my thinking, and is closely related to the one I will be discussing momentarily). The first Christologies were almost certainly based on the idea of “exaltation.” Christ, as a human being, came to be exalted to the right hand of God, where he was made to share in God’s status as a reward for his faithfulness. The earliest Christians – the earthly disciples themselves (or at least some of them: we have no way of knowing if they all “converted” to believe this about Jesus) –thought that this happened at Jesus’ resurrection, where God “made him” the Son of God (and thus the Lord, the messiah to come, the Son of Man, and so on). Later there were Christians who thought this exaltation occurred at his baptism, so that he was the Son of God for his entire ministry. The other type of Christology came a bit later.  It was an “incarnation” Christology which indicated that Jesus was a pre-existent divine being – for example, an angel – who became a human being for the purpose of salvation.  This was the view of Paul, at least insofar as the Christ-poem of Philippians 2 represents not just an earlier point of view but his own view as well.   But this poem, and possibly Paul himself, represent a kind of transitional Christological view, because even though Christ was a pre-existent being who became human, at the resurrection God exalted him even higher than before.  So this perspective combines elements of both an incarnational and an exaltation Christology.  But by the time we get to the Gospel of John, we have an incarnation theology pure and simple, where there is no higher exaltation.  How *could* there be a higher exaltation?  Before the Word became flesh (i.e., before it was incarnated in the person of Jesus Christ), it was *already* “God” as much as God was God


As for the late date of John, Goodacre argues that John uses [the synoptics](https://ntweblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/dating-game-iv-what-about-john.html)",hwjb674,t3_spn6fu,/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/spn6fu/priority_ofjohn/hwjb674/,9,AcademicBiblical,False,0,2022-02-11
Elodious,"I think in some respect Kerensky was probably PO'd about Amaris' Uno-Reverse card he played on Richard Cameron and Terra. It's also possible he didn't fully know or appreciate what bumping up taxes on Perhiphery states would do. Since he couldn't get back to Terra because it was full up with Republican units, why not just go kick down the door of Amaris' realm to cut off the supply of troops and materiel? Ultimately, the Star League didn't wind up getting the smoking remains of the Rim Worlds Republic, those got scooped up by the Lyrans and pirates.

Did the Star League have ""rightful dominion"" over Perphiery states? I don't think so.

duneguy,"Neither of those conclusions make sense.

Our theory of evolution explains a naturally occurring process that accounts for macroscopic changes in species over time. It's not a list of moral decrees. Apex predators exist as a part of a food chain, which forms because it functions as a way to keep populations in balance. Again, this tells us nothing about how we *should* behave, it's merely an explanation for the way ecosystems persist. Regardless, what we do to animals does not remotely resemble a food chain. We breed them into existence by the millions, so we can't argue that we're killing them to keep their populations stable and preserve some kind of natural balance. We breed them and kill them because we enjoy the ""fruits"" of such exploitation. No deference is paid to their well being (execpt those meager allowances that can be capitalized on in marketing) because the fact of their sentience is merely an inconvenience for the profiteers who abuse them. The fact that we have the means to harm them as we please does not morally justify the abuses. Might ≠ right.

As for the religious argument, the Bible is a terribly inconsistent source of moral instruction, as it justifies not only human slavery but the abuse of said slaves. But even taking the section about man's ""dominion over animals"" at face value, certainly dominion does not automatically imply wanton abuse of these animals for human pleasure.

The fact that we even have animal abuse laws in my country is a joke. If I beat my dog for fun I might be sent to jail, but I can breed as many pigs as I possibly can, mutilate them as infants, provide them no comfort whatsoever, kill them while they're still children, and as long as I profit off of their mangled corpses then not only is my abuse allowed, it is rewarded with wealth and political influence.",hwfuyov,t3_spb739,/r/collapse/comments/spb739/our_meat_obsession_is_destroying_the_planet/hwfuyov/,8,collapse,False,0,2022-02-11

idk if 2 mins of screen time qualifies as minor character. Most non JP fans wouldn't even remember that scene/ him in it.

If Dodson is the end game for a 6 part movie series why the fuck didnt they bring him up in JW or FK? Because the writers had no plan, no long term story. They said Dominion is a culmination of all the previous movies and they are gonna just shoehorn Dodson in there and  be like ""he was from the first one, remember that 1 scene!!??"" and hope people just accept it.

Oni_K,"And before anybody breaks out the ""He's only one person."" Let do a deep dive on some of the leaders of the ""Freedom Convoy"".

**James Bauder:**

""Mr Bauder arrived in Ottawa in advance of the convoy, travelling in a recreational vehicle covered in graffiti. He encouraged his followers to sign a “memorandum of understanding” that has become central to the “freedom convoy” (he has since withdrawn it). Starting with an inspirational quotation from Thomas Jefferson (which Jefferson never uttered)""

""Bauder said the hoped-for election would be legitimate because Canada does not use the Dominion voting machines""

**BJ Dichter:**

""At a People’s Party of Canada event in 2019, Dichter made a speech in which he suggested Canada is suffering from the “stench” of “political Islam"" and stated without providing evidence that some then-candidates for the Conservative Party of Canada had ties to ""Islamic extremism.""""

“Let’s assume there were guys there who did have a Confederate flag,” he said. “They believe in the confederacy of states rights in a foreign nation? I don’t care.”

**Chris Barber:**

""Barber calls the COVID-19 vaccine mandates ""tyranny at its finest"" and compares the policy to the strict government oversight of North Korea""

""Barber also said in a subsequent TikTok that he has Confederate flags hanging on his wall at home, calling it a ""piece of cloth"" and telling viewers to ""get over it.""""

**Roger Hodkinson:**

""On Nov. 13. 2020, Hodkinson called in to a meeting of Edmonton city councilors as a member of the public and referred to the pandemic as “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public” and said COVID-19 is “just another bad flu.”""

""During the call to councillors, Hodkinson claimed he was the former chairman of the Royal College of Physicians Canada Examination Committee in Pathology, which was included in some of the social media posts that circulated afterwards. On Nov. 20, 2020, the Royal College clarified that, although Hodkinson was certified as a pathologist in 1976, he was never a chairman of the organization.""

**Randy Hillier:**

""On Feb. 5, Hiller spoke to a large crowd at the convoy, comparing the struggle of the protesters to the struggle of soldiers on Vimy Ridge and saying, “This is the hill we die on.”""

""Hillier has used social media to attack politicians and “mainstream media,” including a tweet posted Jan. 24 calling Transport Minister Omar Alghabra a “terrorist.”""

**TOM QUIGGIN:** 

""In recent years, Quiggin has become a proponent of anti-globalist conspiracy theories, including one that “The Great Reset” outlined by the World Economic Forum to help the global economy recover from COVID-19 is secretly a plan to bring about economic collapse and establish a socialist world order.""  
  
""Quiggin is the co-author of a book called “The New Order of Fear,” which is described on Amazon as “a fictional work that explores how globalists wish to remake our world into a Marxian-inspired totalitarian system.” Quiggin advertised the book in a pinned tweet: “Justin Trudeau is found dead in his bed, strangled with a pair of Halal socks, given to him by Cabinet Minister Omar Alghabra.”""",hwohpuf,t3_sqwbg4,/r/VictoriaBC/comments/sqwbg4/ive_seen_people_on_here_defending_the_convoy_in/hwohpuf/,19,VictoriaBC,False,0,2022-02-12

emisneko,"The Soviet invasion of Hungary was one of the few correct things Khrushchev did. It's worth bearing in mind the uprising in Hungary coincided with Israel, France and UK's attack on Egypt. 

It was a mix of a popular uprising against Khrushchevs faked ""secret"" speech about Stalin which enabled the fascist elements (paid, armed and trained by US and UK) of Hungarian society to gamble their chance on getting rid of socialist rule.

Fascists marked Communists homes with a white cross and those of jews with a black cross for extermination squads:

&gt;The special correspondent of the Yugoslav paper, Politika, 
(Nov. 13, 1956) describing the events of these days, said that! 
the homes of Communists were marked with a white cross and 
those of Jews with a black cross, to serve as signs for the extermination 
squads. “There is no longer any room for doubt,” said 
the Yugoslav reporter, “it is an example of classic Hungarian 
fascism and of White Terror. The information,” continued this 
writer, “coming from the provinces tells how in certain places 
Communists were having their eyes put out, their ears cut off, 
and that they were being killed in the most terrible ways.” 

&gt;Andre Stil, editor-in-chief of the French Communist newspaper, 
LHumanite, arrived in Budapest on November 12. He toured 
the city and conferred with many Communist and other survivors 
of the days of White Terror. His account is substantially the 
same as the reports sent in by Times and Tribune and Commonweal and Commentary and U.S. News and Life and Politika eyewitnesses, fascistic mass murder reminding one of the Berlin days of 1933—and the Budapest days of 1919. Thus: 

&gt;&gt;After the tortures, those who were still breathing were hanged 
Even dead people were hanged. The corpses of those hanged were 
in such a state that many could not be recognized. The trees in 
Republic Square still bear the traces. These corpses, in all parts 
of their bodies, were bored through with bayonet thrusts, assailed 
by kicks, tom by nails, covered with expectoration...

([Herbert Apheker, The Truth About Hungary, p.220](https://archive.org/details/the-truth-about-hungary/page/n1/mode/2up))

CIA sent terrorists to Hungary under the RED SOX program (Horthy here was the leader of the Hungarian fascists under 23 years of fascist rule in Hungary until Soviet liberation). 

&gt;“The CIA sent RED SOX/RED CAP groups in Budapest into action to join the Freedom Fighters and to help organise them… Radio Free Europe, and the RED SOX/RED CAP groups encouraged the rebels.” Often since denied, this was something known at the time to those in the know. For example, on November 10 1956, the FBI tapped a conversation between Pagie Morris and Jay Lovestone. Morris said “I know the whole thing… Do you remember when I said to you that it was criminal to incite a revolution and a rebellion, and not to follow it through? … Well, the Wisner crowd incited it… And the Horthy crowd has been in it… That Radio Free Europe is the crowd that’s behind it.”

(James Jesus Angleton, the CIA, and the Craft of Counterintelligence, by Michael Howard Holzman, pp. 150-160) 

&gt;The CIA chief in Vienna recalled that these “were very sad days” – we sat powerless on the sidelines watching the Soviets preparing to crush the revolution. 

(ibid) 

&gt;**Weapons were British and American**

&gt;    Some of the weapons used were American, and others almost certainly British. Mr Smith says MI6 and the CIA had buried arms caches in the woods around Prague and Budapest for use by “stay-behind” parties or fifth columnists in case of war. 

([MI6 trained rebels to fight Soviets in Hungarian revolt](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/mi6-trained-rebels-to-fight-soviets-in-hungarian-revolt-1359599.html), The Independent)

Hungary, in 1954, was considered a ""weak spot"" of the Soviet Union according to US committee '

&gt;Again on New Years day, 1954, the Foreign Relations Committee of the US Senate released a study, through its chairman, Senator Alexander Wiley which spoke of ""accumulating tensions"" and mounting ""sabotage and underground activities"" in Eastern Europe and referred in particular to Hungary as being the most tender spot - the ""weakest link

(Truth About Hungary p.112) 

&gt;The mid-1950s were regarded by the British and the United States as the last chance to challenge Soviet dominion over eastern Europe. The Eisenhower administration had been elected on a platform of “liberating” the Soviet satellite states, but in the 10 years since the Allied victory in Europe, the Soviet Union had strengthened its hold over the central and eastern part of the continent.

USA was planning on WW3 with Soviet Union in 1943 (2 years before WW2 ended) whilst the British - at war with Hungary at this time ""looked on at favour of Horthy"" (Horthyism was the brand of fascism in Hungary in power for 23 years prior to Soviet liberation which was only more and more influenced by Nazism as the alliance with Austria and Germany deepened during that period and was to be the main fighting force in 1956) 

&gt;	By April 3, 1943, the editors of The Nation, in discussing “Russia After the War,” warned that many of the rich insisted on the inevitability of World War III—a “thought entertained by powerful forces in the United States which fear any modification of property relationships and are made uneasy by the possible existence of a powerful and successful collectivist state in the world.” 

&gt;	Specifically, in terms of Eastern Europe, as Doreen Warriner writes: “In 1944 all the anti-Soviet elements in the Balkan capitals believed that America and Britain would invade the Balkans after the defeat of Germany,” (cited work, p. 21n.). 
&gt;	Leigh White, an American correspondent in the Balkans, writing 
	in 1944, commented upon “the disreputable dynasties (there) of 
	which our Metternichs of the State Department and Foreign 
	Office are apparently so enamored” (cited work, p. 459). The 
	distinguished English historian, Professor A. J. P. Taylor, in his 
	introduction to the Memoirs of Michael Karolyi, declares that: 
	“Even in the Second World War, when Hungary was an enemy 
	state, and democratic Hungarians, one might have thought, our 
	only friends, the British Foreign Office looked with favour on 
	Horthy, Kallay and the rest, while Michael Karolyi was held at 
	arm’s length.” 

([Herbert Apheker, The Truth About Hungary, p.71](https://archive.org/details/the-truth-about-hungary/page/n1/mode/2up))

Americans gravitated toward the fascist elements in Hungary at the end of WWII 

&gt;When I left Italy in the Summer of 1945 (writes Mr. Riegel), 
	talk of an inevitable war with Russia was fashionable with the 
	Catholic Right and the small cynics who know the answer to 
	everything. Arriving in Hungary, I found this same inevitability 
	of war an article of general faith, intensified by a heritage of Nazi 
	propaganda and wishful thinking. 
	
&gt;He found, in agreement with all other observers—the testimony 
	of some of whom has been offered on earlier pages—that .. fascism 
and para-fascism, with their off-shoots of anti-Semitism and 
	clerical reaction, are still strong forces in the country.” 
	
&gt;These forces gained encouragement from the American officials, for in 
	Mr. Riegel’s words: “The Americans gravitate toward the most 
	dubious elements remaining in Hungary, the remnants of the 
	gentry, industrialists, the higher clergy, and the motley assortment of fascists and opportunists.”  

(ibid p. 73)

NATO furnished support to the fascistic elements of the Horthy fascists with:

&gt;The Mutual Security Act (of 1951) has as its stated aim, “to 
maintain the security and promote the foreign policy and provide 
for the general welfare of the U. S. by furnishing assistance to 
friendly nations in the interest of international peace and security.” To this was added an amendment, introduced by Representative Charles Kersten (R., Wis.) and approved by the House (and 
the Senate and signed by President Truman in October) in the 
following form, appended to the above: 

&gt;and for any selected persons who are residing in or escapees from 
the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, or the Communist- 
dominated areas of Germany and Austria, or any other countries 
absorbed by the Soviet Union, either to form such persons into 
national elements of the military forces of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization or for other purposes, when it is similarly 
determined by the President that such assistance is important in 
the defense of the North Atlantic area and of the security of the 
United States (Congressional Record, August 17, 1951, vol. 97, 
p. 10261).

They are trying *really* hard to do an equivalent of Planet of the Apes, but with dinosaurs. There is no way that the ending of the 2nd film could have led to that many dinosaurs being loose. But who knows, maybe more dinosaurs will escape in the beginning of Dominion.

The ones that tried to leave without didn’t, Anguilla tried in 1967 and they’re still a British colony even today, Rhodesia tried and wasn’t recognised, had a war, went back to being a colony for a year before gaining independence with Westminster approval as Zimbabwe. 

By 1921, both Ireland and Britain were sick of war having spent 4 years in WW1 and 3 years fighting each other. Without the first word war and the economic damage and societal trauma it caused Britain probably could have beaten the IRA if other comparable rebellions are anything to go by. 

Ever way, Ireland has to retract vote UDI and replace it with the Anglo-Irish treaty.

JingamaThiggy,"All of the news and information from china and russia is blouted out by American news media. A lot of times the information about russia raging war against ukrain and china's dominion over taiwan is blurred out with strong emotional manipulatives. Im a Chinese myself and i have relatives and friends in taiwan. People in China doesn't hate Taiwanese, its just that corrupted Taiwan politicians are sided with American who came in prodding their nose in our airspace and acting like China is going to take over Taiwan anytime soon. While it's true that taiwan's independence is a problem in China's view, China is ultimately a capitalist country especially with all the global trading connections all over the world. Waging a war to take over Taiwan is like chopping your legs off so you could pick up something your dropped on the floor. The chinese government is not a barbaric senseless organization. They are just like any other country and they do things with reason. If they were as Americans described China wouldn't have risen to this position in the world rn in just 10 years. The problem is that China and Russia is the biggest threat to America's dominance over the world. All of the organized riots and war threats doesn't come from sheer nationalism and there are more than enough evidence to prove that America is playing the puppet master behind the curtains. Its just that none of these evidence ever reach Americans. While talking out censorship in other countries they are the ones that censor the most. Talk about freedom. 

The truth is that no one wants to have war. Nobody wants to be involved in it. Not even politicians, most of them at least. Politicians ultimately cares about money, and war destroys the economy. Every infrastructure every tide in the economy is focused on the war which would kill businesses easily. China and Russia being economic giants on the world stage secures that, with China's electronics and Russia's crude oil, loosing trading partners basically means loosing their job. While they are fully capable of war, it only acts as a measure against others who wage war at them. The only party that profits from war are weapons manufacturers. Which is the role America plays. America have been selling WWII tanks to the Taiwan military to spite China and its a well known fact. Most of these weapons suck, as we here often see news about Taiwanese missing and crashing their American bought jets, flipping over their tanks, sinking their own submarines. If not for war Taiwan would have no reason to buy these armaments. And precisely because China is America's biggest threat, spiting war between China and Taiwan can for one give profit from selling shit weapons to Taiwan and two, divide the capital in China to flow towards military development. This is nothing new. This had been America's strategy for the past 50 years plus, spiting war in other countries and selling them weapons, basically sustaining a wartime economy without actually having to fight. I don't know about the situation in Ukraine, but id assume something similar is going on there, please enlighten me. 

What im trying to say here is America have been spiting wars around the world for ages now and we see so little from other countries because the media coverage is often dominated by American media. Even in news clips like this can be edited or taken out of context to bring a whole different meaning that strays far from the truth. Im not targeting the American people here when i refer to American so please understand its not an ill-willed insult. You can certainly disagree with me on this matter and i would like to hear your side of the deal but please be civil. Calling me a Chinese spy or paid actor just shows how ignorant you are and it just further proves my point.

Heroes:

Dr. Strange draws an encounter card when he reshuffles his invocation deck. 

Hulk's Sub-orbital Leap ignores Crisis Icon when paid for with only physical resources. His Hulk Smash gains Piercing when paid only with physical resources. His Immovable Object now gives him Stalwart. 

Scenarios:

Risky Business- Threat can only be removed from the main scheme when State of Madness is faceup, meaning you can only remove threat when Goblin is out. 

The Once and Future Kang- His second phase defeats the player if his main scheme completes. Two copies of Kang's Dominion is added to the encounter deck.

Top officials at a U.S. federal cybersecurity agency are urging a judge not to authorize at this time the release of a report that analyzes Dominion Voting Systems equipment in Georgia, arguing doing so could assist hackers trying to “undermine election security.”

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was recently provided an unredacted copy of the report, which was prepared by J. Alex Halderman, director of the University of Michigan Center for Computer Security and Society.

The report discusses “potential vulnerabilities in Dominion ImageCast X ballot marking devices,” or electronic voting devices, according to the government.

While CISA supports public disclosure of any vulnerabilities and associated mitigation measures with election equipment, allowing the release of the report at this point “increases the risk that malicious actors may be able to exploit any vulnerabilities and threaten election security,” government lawyers said in a Feb. 10 filing in the case.

The case was brought in 2017 by good-government groups and voters who say the lack of paper ballots undermines the voting process.

U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg, an Obama nominee overseeing the case, was urged by CISA to reject attempts to release a redacted version of Halderman’s report for now.

CISA officials want to review the information in the report and help Dominion resolve the vulnerabilities identified before the report is released. They said they weren’t able to provide a date by which they’ll be finished.

Totenberg must weigh the request against the wishes of Georgia Secretary State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican and one of the defendants, who called in late January for the release to happen immediately.

John Poulos, Dominion’s CEO and president, said in a statement released by Raffensperger’s office that Halderman’s review lacked “a holistic approach,” adding that Dominion “supports all efforts to bring real facts and evidence forward to defend the integrity of our machines and the credibility of Georgia’s elections.”

Plaintiffs, including the Coalition for Good Governance, also support the release of the report, David Cross, one of their lawyers, confirmed to The Epoch Times.

The plaintiffs said in a filing before a copy was sent to CISA that the agency should get a copy and begin its evaluation process, but that the evaluation “should not unreasonably delay the public disclosure of the report, which must be promptly disclosed to Georgia state and county election officials, and filed on the public docket, so that public officials can secure the upcoming May primary elections.”

They asked Totenberg to order them to file a redacted version of the report on the docket, which would make it accessible to the public, no later than March 4.",hwpeyhd,t3_sqxwm6,/r/Conservative/comments/sqxwm6/biden_administration_urges_court_not_to_allow/hwpeyhd/,10,Conservative,False,0,2022-02-12
supermariopants,"“Legends say that the Tritonid deity of the hunt Xythia once appeared to a group of pearl hunters and chose one of them as their champion. From that moment on, pearl farming and pearl fishing became a spiritual task to many Tritonids...”  
*Taika Waerea, A Voyage into the Blue*

**A pearl for your thoughts**  
Unlike the Iguanid Empire, where the currency is strictly regulated by the imperial authorities, the Dominion has no strict exchange policy. While imperial coins are becoming more relevant, the peoples of the Dominion still utilize pearls, shells, and particular seeds as their preferred form of currency. 

**Pearl farming in Odir**  
Due to its massive underwater structure, the statue-island of Odir is the perfect location for pearl farming. Pearl farms are owned by the local Tritonid clans, who also own a series of pearl vaults in the depths of the underwater city. Odir is particularly renowned for its highly sought dark pearls, often sold for stratospheric prices.

**Odir Pearls - Average Value**  
Dark pearl (perfect): 150-250 golden imperials  
Dark pearl (imperfect): 50-150 golden imperials

Tuilien_Aure,"I think it is just a matter of the story and plot driving each other. As you say, it is a mythical account of the past of England. In the stories, the northwestern part of Middle Earth is where the elves who had dwelt in Valinor (Heaven) came back. They brought with them their customs and knowledge, and even something supernatural - it is often said that those who had beheld The Light from beyond The Sea that was before The Sun and Moon had qualities that those who had never been to Valinor did not. 

These elves who returned taught much of what they knew to the men who came first into these lands. Keep in mind, this is just a small part of Middle Earth which is far from the eastern lands where Men first awoke, and many tribes of men were late coming into the west, or came not-at-all.

Meanwhile, Morgoth and his servants held dominion over the wide lands of the north of all of Middle Earth, and thus had more time to corrupt those men who stayed in the East.

meredactyl,"congratulations! :)

the undergraduate admissions office has a website with some videos and photos of what being on campus is like (during non-covid times): [https://about.umbc.edu/visitors-guide/](https://about.umbc.edu/visitors-guide/) 

i'm a master's student on campus and grew up in the area. 

**good things about campus:** 

* lots of open, green space to explore - very tranquil
* great faculty who are both good at their work and (usually) nice on a human level, too - kind, excited about students' work, helpful, good research opportunities
* it's not huge but it's not tiny - you can get to know everyone without feeling like you're only ever seeing the same five people the whole time
* lots of support/resources on campus for anything you might need
* ta opportunities and available funding for research/conference travel
* pretty diverse student population compared to a lot of other schools
* for STEM fields like CSE, a phenomenal connection with employers ranging from local startups to national and global powerhouses

**less-good (?) things about campus:** 

* if you're looking for a party school where something lively and wild is happening all the time, umbc isn't it. campus is not dull, but you won't get the tailgates-and-fraternity-house-parties ""american college life"" experience. 
* it's hard - but not impossible - to get around the area without a car. it can make campus feel kind of isolated or isolating. i'd say this is the only genuine downside in my experience.
* from a grad student perspective, umbc has a heavy focus on undergrad and most of the students on campus are undergrads - about 11,000 vs about 2,500 grad students. it's nice on one hand - your grad classes are small and easily tailored to what you're working on - but on the other hand sometimes it feels a little weird to be older on campus in a sea of 18-21 year olds, and a lot of the programming and events on campus are aimed at that main demographic. 

**general area:**

* most grad students live off campus in arbutus and catonsville, but there is on-campus housing available at walker ave apartments, about 5-10 mins walk from the library and class buildings. the area is generally safe. off-campus student services ([https://ocss.umbc.edu/](https://ocss.umbc.edu/)) has housing and roommate listings you can browse.
   * arbutus: closest to campus, walkable from campus, a couple grocery stores and decent restaurants including pizza and outstanding soul food, great little movie theater
   * catonsville: bigger, more upscale, easiest to drive there, some asian grocery stores, good/great restaurants including italian, indian, korean bbq, pubs
   * baltimore: baltimore is a great city. if you take some time to explore it you can find all sorts of funky and cool stuff. world-class museums (including a fantastic aquarium and a nice, if small, zoo), national historic sites, an endless list of amazing restaurants and concert venues \[big national tours and tiny never-heard-of-them bands\]. two major-league sports teams, the orioles (mlb baseball) and the ravens (nfl football). it can be harder to find some of this stuff than in other cities, but it's all there and it's all wonderful. (note: if you're thinking about living in baltimore itself, you'll need a car, and also you should ask someone who's familiar with the city to help you find a place. there are great neighborhoods in the city - i lived downtown for five years or so - but apartment listings can be misleading whether a place is in that neighborhood or a couple streets away, and that can make a huge difference.)
   * maryland more generally: lots of scenic, historic, and cool things to see and do in and around maryland. with a car, day and weekend trip destinations from campus include:
      * daytrips: dc, philadelphia, annapolis, gettysburg, various state parks (hiking, mountain biking, fishing, canoeing/kayaking, birdwatching, fossil-hunting), king's dominion, hersheypark or six flags (theme parks), skiing and snow tubing
      * weekend/short overnight trips: ocean city and assateague national seashore (beach), deep creek lake (mountains), new york city, shenandoah national park, chincoteague (especially if you go when they're launching a rocket from wallops island)
* it's easiest to get around if you have a car, but you can do okay without one by walking and using the campus shuttle system to reach wider transit networks (regional train \[to dc\], amtrak train \[to philadelphia - 2 hrs one way, nyc - 3 hrs one way, and further if you want\], bwi airport \[great national and pretty good international connections\], etc).",hwnycls,t3_sqlxmh,/r/UMBC/comments/sqlxmh/an_international_student_i_just_got_an_unofficial/hwnycls/,10,UMBC,False,0,2022-02-12

lunatickoala,"Because Star Trek is unwittingly a tale a dystopian society where life isn't valued and death is so commonplace that the horrific death of a redshirt is met with little more than a simple informative statement and a blasé attitude. Even the simplest of safety measures aren't considered because that might give people the idea that their lives have any value.

Starfleet is an organization dedicated to spreading Federation propaganda. It proclaims itself to be a peaceful non-military organization even though it's aggressively expansionist and has fought wars with pretty much all of its neighbors. It proclaims the Federation to be a society of equals even though it speaks to foreign powers though Starfleet which is overwhelmingly human, and humans with connections at that. It proclaims the Federation to be a money-free utopia to hide that the distribution of resources and wealth is controlled by the privileged elite.

It's a setting with vast interstellar empires bent on the domination and subjugation of everyone else like the Borg and the Dominion and the only way to survive is for the Federation itself to become an expansionist empire. Even worse is that there are numerous gods like the Organians, Q, Dowd, Prophets, any of whom could wipe out an entire mortal civilization on a whim. The blasé attitude towards life and the belief that they're living in an enlightened society is necessary for coping with the horrors they see on almost a weekly basis.

In all seriousness though, the exploding console wasn't really a trope in TOS. It did appear in *The Wrath of Khan* in the Kobayashi Maru simulation but there it was meant to be a way to simulate danger *without actually being lethal or damaging the simulator room*. Later in the movie, hits near the bridge area did cause explosions, sparks, and fires but it wasn't just from the consoles but from the walls, floor, ceiling.

That's probably the important takeaway. When they had a feature film budget, they'd rig more substantial pyrotechnics to go off in more believable places. But when they only had a TV show budget, the consoles were a place that they could rig up something that they could set off without damaging the set. Ironically, that means it was essentially a real world version of the Kobayashi Maru simulation: a way to show danger without damaging anything for real.",hwmr8q9,t3_sqa76l,/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/sqa76l/federation_starship_electroplasma_is_formulated/hwmr8q9/,9,DaystromInstitute,False,1,2022-02-12

Gold-Organization-79,"I think if this Altmer's Dunmer family/compatriots vouched enough for him then the Nords and Argonians wouldn't mind terribly. The Nords would probably not care to diffirentiate much, an elf's an elf to them you know, simpler folk. And from my interactions as a Nord main of the Pact I've seen that quite few of the Pact races are openly disdainful of each other, even as the lore calls the alliance politically fragile. To be honest, the Aldmeri Dominion by far is the alliance wherein many are suspected purely due to race. Within the Pact it feels like there needs to be slightly more cause to aim suspicion than that. The Nords are a race of proving yourself above all else; if your Altmer sorcerer accomplished great feats in the name of the Pact, they'd probably come to value and accredit them. They might even find it empowering for the Pact image that an Altmer choses to fight for them, or regail Dominion enemies with taunting jokes relating to it. In short, most Nords would probably come around and wouldn't take it too seriously.

The most volitile situation might be if your Altmer finds himself in Shadowfen where the Dominion in one quest attempts to murder all unborn Argonian hatchlings in one magical strike. The Argonians might be more than reluctant for an Altmer claiming to be the Pact to waltz in, especially since a character of your design would be such a rarity, (Altmer born elsewhere and having no Altmer cultural influence in their upbringing practically doesn't happen due to the sacred centrality of culture the Altmer emphasize among themselves).

Might be that this Altmer has had some difficulties in their youth from Dunmer radicals of the Tribunal or followers of the Prophet Veloth, the leader who led the exodus from Summerset Isle that begat the Chimer in the first place. Altmer still revile that religious schism and what it led to, the Dunmer eventually being created. And likewise the Dunmer detest the Altmer opposition to the founding ideals of their civilization.

Ulmrougha,"&gt;ELI5the basic lore without spoiling me ? 

That...is like asking someone to explain how the solar system works without spoiling you on the science of it all 

&gt; I get confuse by the main faction, the deaderas, the oblivion, the politics, etc. Btw, I didnt started the main quest, just my aliance quest. Even some basic side quest may be hard to understand lore wise. Alot of reference to character I dont know. 

That's..sorta the point though

You aren't SUPPOSED to know everyone right off the bat, lore books and quests fill in gaps, people that used to be referenced are met, places talked about are visited (or not, there's alot of the world left unexplored in TES) 

The world is...well a world, you're just an actor within it 

But

&gt;the deaderas, the oblivion

Daedra (it is inherently plaural btw, there is no s) and the Daedric princes live in Oblivion, we live on Nirn (specifically a continent called tamriel) 

Each prince has their own realm that they rule, within this realm they are effectively a God, when they travel to Nirn they are nearly unstoppable entities without the power of one of their kin at your back (this is usually the Aedra, same species different views) 

Each prince has a set of  ""spheres"" that dictates their Personality, they can no more change it than you can change the earth to be mars with your thoughts, despite each being..difficult to understand from a mortal PoV they do not ever stray from their spheres 

Ultimately you are nothing to a even the lowest of the daedra, you are but a fading worm looking to the eyes of a true immortal and claiming power, amusing..but still nothing 

&gt;the politics

What do you mean? 

Politics are..well politics, the basis of the base game is rather simple (for the faction story anyway), each faction is trying to take a stake a claim on the imperial city, it fell due to a combination of treason and incompetence

The imperial city is very..very akin to Rome, each faction (rightfully) thinks whoever has the throne has dominion over all 

Empires come and go, but they keep raising and putting down all in their path until they bow to the empire of die (with varying amounts of success, some empires are small other such as tibe rseptims effectively rule the continent to a degree that even nations that can't be touched like black Marsh fall in line) 

&gt;Btw, I didnt started the main quest, just my aliance quest. Even some basic side quest may be hard to understand lore wise. Alot of reference to character I dont know. 

Play the game, do the mages questline and pick up ANY book you find, esp the glowing blueish/purple ones 

Read and pay attention to the story, don't rush it

Alot of your questions are actually answered in game, either directly or via books (you can read any book you pick up via the journal, it'll be under the lore library section) 

ESO/TES has alot of problems in general but the lore and story have never been particularly bad, and alot of the fun comes in learning it 

Do bear in mind despite being the MC, the story started before you and will continue after your death, you're not supposed to know everyone initially, they'll be fleshed out eventually",hwo2gq9,t3_sqw03v,/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/sqw03v/help_me_understand_the_lore/hwo2gq9/,7,elderscrollsonline,False,1,2022-02-12

Compt321,"&gt;Why was that impossible for Russia? Is Bulgaria really so much more Western than Russia? Or did we just not try very hard with Russia?

Obviously the Warsaw pact and Russia are going to be very different seeing as the Warsaw pact was created to hold countries by force in the soviet sphere of influence. 

Another difference is how powerful Russia is compared to their neighbors which gives them entirely different incentives and goals such as lashing out against these countries and their western allies to further their own interests at the expense of those countries and creating a rift between Russian citizens and ""the west"" so that they can be more easily controlled by their government.

That could make you ask ""if their citizens could become westernised why don't we try harder?"", I believe that the Russian government would act even worse than it does now in that situation because of the legacy and way of thinking of the USSR widening the gap between russians and the west even more. But of course there's also NATO's political position which seems to be the thing you are rightly criticising, the American people and those that were under USSR dominion would probably have refused to bring Russia in NATO even if it's possible it would actually help everyone.",hwnybgr,t3_sqrhl0,/r/Destiny/comments/sqrhl0/newest_adam_something_video_about_ukraine/hwnybgr/,6,Destiny,False,0,2022-02-12

hamishdehmer,"I personally start with real people who do something notable, or do a set of notable things with a general theme. Then, there's two roots you can take, the first is you make them slightly legendary while they're still alive, and the second being you make them slowly become legendary through mythological telephone, i.e. killing three men single handedly becomes 10, becomes 20, becomes 50, and so on. With the first one, I'd introduce some sort of veneration of the character either during their life or after they die. 

During their life usually means the person is some kind of king or equivalent and the character themself actively promotes that veneration of them has some supernatural element. In death, the veneration could be to get their help with whatever they were renowned for, or you can go the ""spirit of the mountain"" path and have the veneration be more superstitious like if you don't pay special attention to them you might be unlucky.

 Then, with a ""telephone deity"" just slowly prescribe stories and attributes to them like associating them with preexisting deities, or other supernatural beings or events that preexisted or had their genesis with the character we're focusing on. Over time associate veneration of this character again with either gaining luck, or preventing bad luck. Such as a character who's became associated with fertility and burning an offering to them might entail you get pregnant or your field has higher yields, or it prevents stillborns or blight.

Next, the character, if they have a place dedicated to them at this point, slowly becomes the dominant spiritual being in the surrounding area, possibly with a cult forming that takes veneration much more seriously. If they do not have a place where their presence is centralized, then perhaps a cult can arise through a group's regular veneration of the spiritual being, i.e. a military unit venerates them for good luck and gets serious about it and takes it home to their family or a large portion of a town or city venerate the being and begin group veneration in larger numbers and with more standard rituals. Then, the cult slowly spreads through initiation, ethnicity, or some other vector, such as state mandate if the cult is particularly influential.

From this point, you can take it in a bunch of different directions, the being can become very personal, have a very standard and agreed upon physical form, personality, etc etc and can be part of a pantheon in which they either have a general or vague dominion over certain aspects of life or have very strict dominions where they either reign supreme or become side kick deities.

I've made religions through taking eight or nine characters, making them legendary in life and through word of mouth after they die, then slowly bring them into association with each other through contact and cultural mixing until they become a pantheon, at which point many myths are made up or insinuated from their history. Rituals can arise from wanting to put on a show to venerate the deity through dance, wanting to appease through offerings or sacrifices, sending messages to them through thought or prayer, or communing with them through some ecstatic method of convening. Priests can form through exclusive knowledge or purely class specific roles, whom create prayers or offerings through different templates of rituals with details filled in for the intended effect.

If you can't even appreciate that these guys are having genuine fun and enjoyment, maybe it's time to think if you yourself should keep playing for honor, as you probably don't even know how to enjoy it anymore, you are the kind of toxic loser that sucks the fun out of the game and then blames it on the rest.

Thetallerestpaul,"Katrec Eartharm surveyed the bar area in The Cracked Barrel. He had not been this far south in years, but taverns on dangerous roads were all the same, and the familiar sounds, sights and, unfortunately, smells filled his senses. The drinks that were drunk, the curses that were called, and the games that were gambled on all varied from province to province, but outside of those cosmetic differences there was little to tell one pub from another. 
  

He walked to the bar, noting the slight downswell in noise that followed his passage through the throng. Apparently, they were not used to seeing Dwarves this far from the mountains. No one overtly looked at him or said anything though. The creatures that frequented places like this were fairly well versed in minding their own fucking business. Much better for keeping yourself free of holes, in all their shared experience. 
  
The constant traffic around the bar itself had pushed the straw away, and the flags underneath were smooth and well fitted. Katric nodded to himself, always appreciative of good stonemasonry. He looked with new interest at the internal architecture and his practised eye saw it was excellent work. This building would last for many generations. A good place for a dwarf to stop for the night, and a rarety in human-dominated parts of the world.
 
He hopped up onto a barstool and tried in vain to get the attention of the landlord. 
  
""That goblin-rutting gnome beard"", he muttered to himself as the landlord ignored his waving to serve a couple of Elves.
  
  
The patron on his left snorted into their drink. 
  
""Something funny?"", asked Katric, turning to face them. His tone was good-natured, but that tone did not reach his hard grey eyes.
  
  
""No, I just enjoy a good curse"", said the hunched woman. ""At my age, you have to take your joy where you can find it, and Dwarvish phrasing is an unexpected pleasure."" 
  
  
She looked at Katric with milky, obscured eyes and smiled. 
  
  
Katric's blood ran cold, and magma hot at the same time. His expression didn't outwardly change but everything else in his world flipped on its axis. 
  

  
The woman held out a liver-spotted hand. ""Where are my manners? I'm Helena of Chridi--""
  

""I know who you are, Mage"", said Katric gruffly.
  

""I've not been a mage for years. When did we meet? I'm afraid my eyesight isn't what it once was. I used to never forget a face. I suppose I still don't, I just rarely see any clearly anymore.""
  

""Helena!"", said the landlord, finally deciding to come to see what business he could secure. ""Who's your friend here?""
  

""Well, that's what I'm trying to find out, Harald"", she replied. ""What did you say your name was?""
  

""Katric"", said Katric. ""Katric Eartharm.""
  

Helena shook her head slowly. ""I'm very sorry but that doesn't ring any bells. I've met a few dwarves over the years, but not enough that I'd forget that.""
  

There was an awkward pause.
  

""Well, can I get you and your forgotten friend anything?"", asked the barkeep, never one to miss a chance to defuse tension or make a sale. Both protected his profit margins. 
  

""It wasn't always my name"", Katric said. ""And no, we don't need anything right now"".
  

Harald looked at Helena, who shrugged. ""OK, well you know where I'll be"", he said, leaving the old mage and the angry looking dwarf to their conversation. 
  

Helena took a sip of her ale thoughtfully. ""Your voice is familiar. What was your name when I knew you then?""
  

Katric should have thought carefully about how he responded to that question, but his mind was swirling and that option was not available to him. ""Carter"", he blurted out.



""Oh my god! Carter?"", breathed the old woman. ""It can't be?""
  

  
""I used to be called Carter Blackstock"", he continued. ""But that man died where you left him, Helena. He remains entombed in the Mines of Barakroon.""
  

  
Helenas left hand went instinctively to the protective amulet she still wore around her neck. Some things never changed. She put her hand out to touch his face, and despite his fury, Katric let her. 
  

  
""It can't be"", she said again, shaking her head. ""You feel so young. My vision was true, then.""
  

  
""Dwarfish food and less time in the weather clearly agrees with me. What vision?""
  

  
Helena's hands dropped to her sides. She seemed suddenly even older. ""I should have killed you. I'm sorry. I just couldn't do it. I still loved you.""
  

  
""You're sorry for not killing me? Well, you did a pretty solid job of trapping me in that mine for someone who loved me, you conniving ruster. If it wasn't for those dwarves coming along when they did, I wouldn't be here to apologise to.""
  

  
""You're not a dwarf"", said Helena simply. 
  

  
""Well, no, but my wife and her people don't know that. It was the only way. They don't know I'm just a short human.""
  

  
Helena took a long drink and then sighed sadly. ""You're not a human either, Carter. Isn't that obvious now?""
  

  
Kartric frowned. ""What do you mean?""
  

  
""Well, look at me"", she replied. ""And look at you. We were young together. Do you remember?"" She gripped his hand with her frail fingers. ""You are as strong today as you were then. I can feel that much, even if I can't see you.""
  

  
""Dwarvish food an--""
  

  
""You were never a fool, so don't act like one now"", said Helena angrily. Katric had the odd experience of being chided by a frail old woman, whom he had lain with, in the flower of both of their youths. She was right. Maybe he had lost count of the years. Kings did seem to be coming and going more quickly than he remembered. 
  

  
""How old are you?"", he asked slowly. ""Time is harder to keep track of underground.""
  

  
""I'm 92"", she said. 
  

  
Katric gasped. ""Impossible.""
  

  
""Very possible I'm afraid. My power is waning now, and all these years will catch up with me soon enough. Your power, however doesn't seem to be fading at all.""
  

  
""I....I haven't any power"", protested Katric weakly. ""It's just the food and the....um....""
  

  
""And the fact that you are not human. I knew the first time we kissed, but I wouldn't trust my instincts"", she covered her face with her hands and sobbed once.
  

  
Katric saw in his mind's eye the beautiful young mage, sitting head in hands as she was now. He'd awoken to find her deep in thought next to their bed the morning she'd left him to die. 
  

  
""You planned it"", he said simply. ""You took us to that mine so you and the others could be rid of me"".
  

  
She nodded. ""My vision. It seemed so real, and I guess it was. I had to do it. But I was too weak"".
  

  
""What did your vision show you?"" asked Katric. ""What was enough to cast me aside, and condemn me to death? I've hurt no one who didn't deserve it. I have stolen nothing that could not be replaced. What have I done?""
  

  
Helena rubbed her eyes and looked at him again with tears in her watery, clouded eyes. 
  

  
""It's not what you have done, it's what you will do.""
  

  
""You sentenced me to death for a crime I've not even committed?""
  

  
She nodded. ""Yes. For the good of us all. To stop the war that will come, between you and your mother.""
  

  
""My mother is dead. She was dead when we met.""
  

  
She shook her head. ""Not that shoemaker, who looked after you. I'm talking about your real mother. I'm talking about the war between the people of the Middle Kingdoms, and the legions of the Netherworld, over who holds dominion in this life and the next.""
  

  
She finished her drink in one gulp and gestured for another from Harald. ""You are the son of the Queen of Death, and she has been searching for you. I think that one day soon she will find you, and from that day, the world will burn.""

The Commonwealth of Nations, generally known simply as the Commonwealth, is a political association of 54 member states, almost all of which are former territories of the British Empire.

Queen Elizabeth II, in her address to Canada on Dominion Day in 1959, pointed out that the Confederation of Canada on 1 July 1867 had been the birth of the ""first independent country within the British Empire"". She declared: ""So, it also marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which is now known as the Commonwealth of Nations.""

Aggravating_Isopod19,"I’m only recently vegan but the last 32 years I was an ethical vegetarian first and foremost. That was in the 1980’s. I didn’t know of a single vegetarian (and hadn’t even heard of a vegan) back then. I was a 15 year old kid who instinctively never felt right about the consumption of animals (seems like people forget that humans are animals too). I was very uneducated about the veg*n world and had no resources to turn to (pre-internet). Basically I reached a point where I realized that my parents could no longer force me to eat meat, so just like that I quit. It never occurred to me that dairy and eggs killed animals and as a person raised on a typical meat &amp; potatoes diet, my diet consisted of pizza, salad, and that’s about it. I hated other vegetables at the time bc in my house they were always boiled frozen veggies and that was so gross to me. To be honest, I never learned how to cook healthy. I haven’t watched Dominion yet (and doubt I could stomach it if I did) but honestly I just didn’t know what to eat if it didn’t contain dairy. I don’t feel any more ethical now as a vegan than I did a vegetarian. My heart was always in the right place but I didn’t have the education to do better. The reason I made the switch was to become healthier as I certainly recognized that those products were not good for me. You can tear me apart if you want but I know who I am and I’ve always advocated for animals, volunteered in rescue and rehabilitation, and basically supported the cause against *absolutely everyone* I’d ever known as to why not consuming animals is the right thing to do. Attacking people who truly are doing the best they know how such as in vegetarianism is short sighted at best. IMO, opening up a gentle conversation where you can offer some input they haven’t yet heard or considered is the best way to go.",hwsrknm,t3_sriv1f,/r/vegan/comments/sriv1f/what_vegetarians_doesnt_understand/hwsrknm/,10,vegan,False,0,2022-02-13

firstpitchthrow,"&gt; He destroyed Vulcan too and it added nothing to his movies other than having one less place to take the stories too, its bad enough that everything else from the original movies was turned into misery and failure.

Can I speak about how utterly dumb this was in the Abrams Star Trek movie? 

You want to know what makes it even dumber?  That he had Spock Prime move into the Kelvin timeline.  

Vulcan is destroyed, that's a pretty big deal, and it fundamentally alters the nature of Star Fleet, the Federation, and Earth.  I get that.  

However, you have Spock Prime right there.  The fact that Spock Prime is there is why this doesn't make sense.  

Vulcan is destroyed.  Do you have any IDEA what Spock Prime saw in his life?  

He was there when the Battle at Wolf 359 happened.  He was there for one of the two times the Federation ever declared a state of emergency on earth: when that Borg Cube was in orbit around the earth, and the assimilation of the entire Federation appeared inevitable.  Spock Prime was there, he lived through that day.  

Spock Prime was also there when the other state of emergency in the history of earth happened: when the founders infiltrated earth.  You want to talk about how shook the federation was when Vulcan was destroyed?  How about how shook the federation would be when an equally core Federation world, Betazed, was conquered and occupied by the Dominion?  

At least with Nero and Vulcan, people can understand this thing.  You can't reason with the Borg, you can't negotiate with the collective (exception: unless your Captain Janeway, the only one who ever could).  At least you knew who Nero and the enemy was, you have no idea who the Dominion is, the Founders could be anyone, anywhere, they could be standing right beside you.  One advanced Romulan ship you have to destroy, the Jem Hadar are limitless and the Dominion can grow new ones faster than you can kill them.  

Am I the only one who wants to tell the Abrams Trek Federation, in the words of John De Lancie's Q, ""oh, grow up.""  If you can't get through this, if something like Vulcan being destroyed is going to make you come unhinged, then you don't have what it takes to combat the Borg, or the Dominion or the other far more powerful threats that lie ahead.  You won't have what it takes to beat the Sphere Builders later on down the timeline either.  

The entire reason the Federation got through those threats is because of maturity.  You would think Spock Prime would remind them of that.  I felt like what the Federation most needed after the destruction of Vulcan was a little perspective.  

I get it, the destruction of Vulcan was a 9/11 commentary.  There's just one problem with that: Deep Space 9 was already the first post-9/11 show.  it was post 9/11 despite the fact that it went off the air in 1999.  The more time goes by, the better Deep Space 9 ages, because it was a show that tackled themes and ideas that people weren't thinking about yet, it was ahead of it's time.  

Star Trek already had a post-9/11 show, and it was done a hell of a lot better than JJ Abrams Star Trek ever was.  As always, JJ just repeats what's come before, only he does a far worse job of it than better creative talents did before.

7duckswithmachetes,"
A number of Socialists have latterly launched a regular crusade against what they call the principle of authority. It suffices to tell them that this or that act is authoritarian for it to be condemned. This summary mode of procedure is being abused to such an extent that it has become necessary to look into the matter somewhat more closely.
Authority, in the sense in which the word is used here, means: the imposition of the will of another upon ours; on the other hand, authority presupposes subordination. Now, since these two words sound bad, and the relationship which they represent is disagreeable to the subordinated party, the question is to ascertain whether there is any way of dispensing with it, whether — given the conditions of present-day society — we could not create another social system, in which this authority would be given no scope any longer, and would consequently have to disappear.
On examining the economic, industrial and agricultural conditions which form the basis of present-day bourgeois society, we find that they tend more and more to replace isolated action by combined action of individuals. Modern industry, with its big factories and mills, where hundreds of workers supervise complicated machines driven by steam, has superseded the small workshops of the separate producers; the carriages and wagons of the highways have become substituted by railway trains, just as the small schooners and sailing feluccas have been by steam-boats. Even agriculture falls increasingly under the dominion of the machine and of steam, which slowly but relentlessly put in the place of the small proprietors big capitalists, who with the aid of hired workers cultivate vast stretches of land.
Everywhere combined action, the complication of processes dependent upon each other, displaces independent action by individuals. But whoever mentions combined action speaks of organisation; now, is it possible to have organisation without authority?
Supposing a social revolution dethroned the capitalists, who now exercise their authority over the production and circulation of wealth. Supposing, to adopt entirely the point of view of the anti-authoritarians, that the land and the instruments of labour had become the collective property of the workers who use them. Will authority have disappeared, or will it only have changed its form? Let us see.
Let us take by way of example a cotton spinning mill. The cotton must pass through at least six successive operations before it is reduced to the state of thread, and these operations take place for the most part in different rooms. Furthermore, keeping the machines going requires an engineer to look after the steam engine, mechanics to make the current repairs, and many other labourers whose business it is to transfer the products from one room to another, and so forth. All these workers, men, women and children, are obliged to begin and finish their work at the hours fixed by the authority of the steam, which cares nothing for individual autonomy. The workers must, therefore, first come to an understanding on the hours of work; and these hours, once they are fixed, must be observed by all, without any exception. Thereafter particular questions arise in each room and at every moment concerning the mode of production, distribution of material, etc., which must be settled by decision of a delegate placed at the head of each branch of labour or, if possible, by a majority vote, the will of the single individual will always have to subordinate itself, which means that questions are settled in an authoritarian way. The automatic machinery of the big factory is much more despotic than the small capitalists who employ workers ever have been. At least with regard to the hours of work one may write upon the portals of these factories: Lasciate ogni autonomia, voi che entrate! [Leave, ye that enter in, all autonomy behind!]
If man, by dint of his knowledge and inventive genius, has subdued the forces of nature, the latter avenge themselves upon him by subjecting him, in so far as he employs them, to a veritable despotism independent of all social organisation. Wanting to abolish authority in large-scale industry is tantamount to wanting to abolish industry itself, to destroy the power loom in order to return to the spinning wheel.
Let us take another example — the railway. Here too the co-operation of an infinite number of individuals is absolutely necessary, and this co-operation must be practised during precisely fixed hours so that no accidents may happen. Here, too, the first condition of the job is a dominant will that settles all subordinate questions, whether this will is represented by a single delegate or a committee charged with the execution of the resolutions of the majority of persona interested. In either case there is a very pronounced authority. Moreover, what would happen to the first train dispatched if the authority of the railway employees over the Hon. passengers were abolished?
But the necessity of authority, and of imperious authority at that, will nowhere be found more evident than on board a ship on the high seas. There, in time of danger, the lives of all depend on the instantaneous and absolute obedience of all to the will of one.
When I submitted arguments like these to the most rabid anti-authoritarians, the only answer they were able to give me was the following: Yes, that's true, but there it is not the case of authority which we confer on our delegates, but of a commission entrusted! These gentlemen think that when they have changed the names of things they have changed the things themselves. This is how these profound thinkers mock at the whole world.
We have thus seen that, on the one hand, a certain authority, no matter how delegated, and, on the other hand, a certain subordination, are things which, independently of all social organisation, are imposed upon us together with the material conditions under which we produce and make products circulate.
We have seen, besides, that the material conditions of production and circulation inevitably develop with large-scale industry and large-scale agriculture, and increasingly tend to enlarge the scope of this authority. Hence it is absurd to speak of the principle of authority as being absolutely evil, and of the principle of autonomy as being absolutely good. Authority and autonomy are relative things whose spheres vary with the various phases of the development of society. If the autonomists confined themselves to saying that the social organisation of the future would restrict authority solely to the limits within which the conditions of production render it inevitable, we could understand each other; but they are blind to all facts that make the thing necessary and they passionately fight the world.
Why do the anti-authoritarians not confine themselves to crying out against political authority, the state? All Socialists are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society. But the anti-authoritarians demand that the political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed. They demand that the first act of the social revolution shall be the abolition of authority. Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon — authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?
Therefore, either one of two things: either the anti-authoritarians don't know what they're talking about, in which case they are creating nothing but confusion; or they do know, and in that case they are betraying the movement of the proletariat. In either case they serve the reaction.

GanyuMain2506,"It's the same logic as the Dendro slime. The large Dendro slime hides inside the earth, probably symbolising Geo, as in Liyue which is the Geo Archon's dominion. The smaller Dendro slimes could represent Kusanali.

So basically, this is wholly taken from several other theories but, Kusanali and Baizhu most probably are the new Dendro archon and the old Dendro archon respectively, and Baizhu's hiding in Liyue so that in his weakened state, the Fatui wouldn't take his Gnosis.

I have a theory that he's most probably only in his weakened state cause of the Cataclysm 500 years ago where it said the God of Wood died, but we're just hoping that he was PRESUMED dead because he was in Khaenri'ah for whatever reason, when the Cataclysm started. Building on that, we can say that he hadn't been completely affected by Erosion probably because he got away, and told Kusanali to act as the Current Dendro Archon to cover for him.

 The video Mihoyo released about the other regions say that there is a push for folly in Sumeru yet the Archon makes no attempt to correct them and we can say that Kusanali thinks it's okay for the sages to continue with their crack-pot theories since it just leads them farther away from the truth.

Myr_Lyn,"Trump is a malignant narcissist.  To a malignant narcissist a ""moral wasteland"" is a world he can grift and then demand that the people he grifts think he is their new savior.
Do not forget for a moment, he is a psychopath whose illness is contagious for people whose mental illness makes them susceptible to, and unable to resist charismatic charlatans.  
If you doubt that, just consider the demographics of his followers. 
Evangelicals are susceptible to charismatic charlatans who fake being preachers or religious advisors.  ""Send me money for my new custom jet plane and Jesus will make you wealthy and powerful. And, God will grant you the right to force others to bow down to you in submission.""
Nazi and white supremists also are susceptible to charismatic charlatans. Watching the leaders and followers of some of these groups, who have been charged with Jan. 6th crimes, explain themselves in court and media reveals their unstable mental states.  
Trump is not even the lead actor in this.  He is the pawn of the religious Dominion groups like The Family and Opus Dei who work with the Federalist Society to move the US to a theocracy.
For the Dominion connection see: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_theology
For the Catholic connection you can read the articles at the links below to see that Bill Barr was a Director of the group (but claims he was not a member).  That should raise an eyebrow or two. https://www.ncronline.org/news/justice/william-barr-nations-top-lawyer-culture-warrior-catholic) 
https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/william-barr-notre-dame-secularism/

Now that has expanded to taking over Congress and local governments and boards. See:

_Olorin_the_white,"Apart from what others said, I think the War of the Valar also reflects the overall meaning behind the quote:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Thus began the first battle of the Valar with Melkor for the dominion of Arda; and of those tumults the Elves know but little. For what has here been declared is come from the Valar themselves, with whom the Eldalië spoke in the land of Valinor, and by whom they were instructed; but little would the Valar ever tell of the wars before the coming of the Elves. Yet it is told among the Eldar that the Valar endeavoured ever, in despite of Melkor, to rule the Earth and to prepare it for the coming of the Firstborn; **and they built lands and Melkor destroyed them; valleys they delved and Melkor raised them up; mountains they carved and Melkor threw them down; seas they hollowed and Melkor spilled them; and naught might have peace or come to lasting growth, for as surely as the Valar began a labour so would Melkor undo it or corrupt it.** And yet their labour was not all in vain; and though nowhere and in no work was their will and purpose wholly fulfilled, and all things were in hue and shape other than the Valar had at first intended, slowly nonetheless the Earth was fashioned and made firm. And thus was the habitation of the Children of Ilúvatar established at the last in the Deeps of Time and amidst the innumerable stars.”

So, Arda was created by all Ainur (Melkor included), but after the music, when they were shaping it, Melkor seems to prefer to destroy their creation rather than creating his own things.

Worth noticing that since the music of the ainur, Melkor was always the one different, that changed the tones of the music:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Some of these thoughts he \[Melkor\] now wove into his music, **and straightway discord arose about him, and many that sang nigh him grew despondent, and their thought was disturbed and their music faltered**; but some began to attune their music to his rather than to the thought which they had at first. **Then the discord of Melkor** spread ever wider, **and the melodies which had been heard before foundered in a sea of turbulent sound**. But Ilúvatar sat and hearkened until it seemed that about his throne there was a raging storm, as of dark waters that made war one upon another in an endless wrath that would not be assuaged.

So, Melkor did ""create"" something here, as part of his music is also part of the creation of Arda, but note that his ""creation"" is rather a distorcion of the existing music, **so he basically disturbed and ""changed"" the music to contain his own evil,** such thing makes a good parallel to the corruption of elves later on, but someone else already quoted that.",hwx97fo,t3_ss8vfu,/r/tolkienfans/comments/ss8vfu/ive_been_seeing_evil_cannot_create_anything_new/hwx97fo/,13,tolkienfans,False,0,2022-02-14

[11] And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
[12] And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
[13] And the evening and the morning were the third day.
[14] And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: [15] And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
[16] And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
[17] And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
[18] And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
[19] And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
[20] And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
[21] And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
[22] And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
[23] And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
[24] And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
[25] And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
[26] And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
[27] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
[28] And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that move",hwukwg0,t3_srwfc7,/r/FridayNightHighJinks/comments/srwfc7/banned_from_anon7s_server_for_not_defending/hwukwg0/,12,FridayNightHighJinks,False,0,2022-02-14

Its_MumbleBee,"**Things that get advertised to you in the crown store but can be obtained ingame:**  


\- Attribute and Skill Respectification Scrolls  -&gt; You'll find two shrines in the temple/cathedral of every major city in tamriel, which offer the exact same service for a small amount of gold.  
They are usually marked on the map with the following symbol: [Click Me!](https://eso-hub.com/storage/guides/rtra5fkk7B9VwYY5gLt2D7XdOFEbBlW7XcA9RIA4.jpg)  


\- Crown XP Scrolls -&gt; Don't waste your money on these. You'll be granted a few free xp scrolls as a level up reward while playing the game. Those also show up quite often in the 'Daily Rewards'. You'll find those listed behind the calendar symbol in the top right corner of the crown store.

\- Crown Supply Kit (Small and Giant-Sized) -&gt; These kits contain nothing but things that will be thrown at you for free as a daily login reward or will fill your inventory quite fast once you start playing. And you'll be drowning in these items, I promise. Don't fall for this predatory nonsense.  
You can buy repair kits and soul gems (empty and filled) for gold from merchants in every city and you can even collect soul gems simply by picking them up in the open world. They are everywhere and not worth any actual money **!!!**

[**Everything from this section of the crown store is obtainable in a heartbeat ingame.**](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/crownstore/category/3#bundles)  
(Or finds a more efficient replacement which can be obtained ingame)

\- Vampire/Werewolf Bites -&gt; Depending on the alliance of your character, you can travel to a specific zone which holds both a shrine for vampires and werewolfs. Simply ask in zone chat for a free bite and you'll 100% find the curse of your liking for the fair price of **nothing**.  


Just travel to either Bangkorai (Daggerfall Covenant), Rift (Ebonheart Pact) or Reaper's Marsh (Aldmeri Dominion).  


\- Pre-furnished houses -&gt; The furnishing which you'll receive by buying a house in ESO for actual money (Crowns) is in most cases not worth a single dime. Also, a lot of houses can be purchased with gold. Some of them require a zone-related achievement uphand.  


\- Riding Lessons -&gt; Don't drop your money on those. The amount of scrolls YOU would have to buy to feel a significant difference in your riding speed is atrociously high and an absolute waste of money. If you can't stand the slow riding speed at the start, you're not alone. But until you've at least dropped 30-40 points into 'Riding Speed' you'll be faster on foot.  


To advance your riding skills, you need to walk to a stable master in any city and buy a lesson in one of the three categories for 250 Gold. This amount of gold is absolutely nothing.  


\- Research Scrolls -&gt; Don't do it. You'll get plenty of those from the daily login rewards and you can also buy them in exchange for writ vouchers (a special currency you will be rewarded with ingame by doing special crafting quests)  


\- Inventory chests -&gt; Also obtainable with writ vouchers (see the post above).",hww521a,t3_ss1e3r,/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/ss1e3r/for_the_new_souls/hww521a/,12,elderscrollsonline,False,0,2022-02-14

EB8Jg4DNZ8ami757,"Let's say we rewind two centuries. Should we applaud a slave owner for reducing the amount of slaves they own? Or should we uphold that abolition of slavery is the only answer?  

Should we applaud someone who goes from beating their children every day to only doing it every other day? Or should we condemn them for abusing children?  

In a utilitarian way to the cause, sure, reduction is good, but reduction is not the goal. The way this sub panders to non-vegans gets old. You won't see me applauding their continued abuse.  

Before you start with the, ""You get more flies with honey than with vinegar,"" line, let's remember there's no surefire way to convince anyone. I'm sure most of know people who watched *Dominion* and still eat meat.  

Also the idea that the sale of plant based items at these businesses *reduces* meat consumption is wrong.  
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/which-fast-food-has-fake-meat-not-many-serve-beyond-meat-impossible-foods  
&gt;Orders of plant-based burgers and sandwiches at fast-food restaurants were unchanged for the year ended in June, while beef burger orders climbed 12% over the same period, according to market researcher NPD Group Inc.  

Meat consumption is at *an all time high on a per capita basis*.  
https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2021/05/an-overview-of-meat-consumption-in-the-united-states.html  
&gt;From 1999 to 2006, meat consumption averaged over 250 pounds per person. Then, meat consumption fell from 2007 to 2013, reaching a low of 235 pounds per person in 2014. From 2015 to 2019, per capita consumption increased each year, reaching 264 pounds per person in 2020.  

So don't go patting yourself on the back for ordering a vegan item at KFC (and honestly, if you eat at KFC you should fucking reevaluate some shit.)

Zakalwen,"That's an interesting question. I suspect Cardassia would have eventually joined the Dominion under Dukat, even without the Klingon war. Reason being that Dukat is a tyrant fanatically obsessed with his legacy. He can't stand the idea that Cardassia abandoned the occupation, or that it's a second rate power in local space. A less self-obsessed leader with the same beliefs might be content to focus on internal development but Dukat is a died-in-the-wool imperialist. He truly believes that he deserves a seat at the table with the three great powers (ideally the chair's seat).

One way or the other he would have found a justification to say ""yes"" when the Vorta came calling.

MeroFromVero,"*""Those who are uninformed of the world of reality, who do not comprehend existing things, who are without perception of the inner truth of creation, who do not penetrate the real mysteries of material and spiritual phenomena and who possess only a superficial idea of universal life and being are but embodiments of pure ignorance. They believe only that which they have heard from their fathers and ancestors. Of themselves they have no hearing, no sight, no reason, no intellect; they rely solely upon tradition. Such persons imagine that the dominion of God is an accidental dominion, or Kingdom.*

""***For instance, they believe that this world of existence was created six or seven thousand years ago, as if God did not reign before that time and had no creation before that period. They think that Divinity is accidental, for to them Divinity is dependent upon existing things, whereas, in reality, as long as there has been a God, there has been a creation.*** *As long as there has been light, there have been recipients of that light, for light cannot become manifest unless those things which perceive and appreciate it exist. The world of Divinity presupposes creation, presupposes recipients of bounty, presupposes the existence of worlds. No Divinity can be conceived as separate from creation, for otherwise it would be like imagining an empire without a people. A king must needs have a kingdom, must needs have an army and subjects. Is it possible to be a king and have no country, no army, no subjects? This is an absurdity. If we say that there was a time when there was no country, no army and no subjects, how then could there have been a king and ruler? For these things are essential to a king.*

*""Consequently, just as the reality of Divinity never had a beginning—that is, God has ever been a Creator, God has ever been a Provider, God has ever been a Quickener, God has ever been a Bestower—so there never has been a time when the attributes of God have not had expression. The sun is the sun because of its rays, because of its heat. Were we to conceive of a time when there was a sun without heat and light, it would imply that there had been no sun at all and that it became the sun afterward. So, likewise, if we say there was a time when God had no creation or created beings, a time when there were no recipients of His bounties and that His names and attributes had not been manifested, this would be equivalent to a complete denial of Divinity, for it would mean that Divinity is accidental. To explain it still more clearly, if we think that fifty thousand years ago or one hundred thousand years ago there was no creation, that there were then no worlds, no human beings, no animals, this thought of ours would mean that previous to that period there was no Divinity. If we should say that there was a time when there was a king but there were no subjects, no army, no country for him to rule over, it would really be asserting that there was a time when no king existed and that the king is accidental. It is, therefore, evident that inasmuch as the reality of Divinity is without a beginning, creation is also without a beginning. This is as clear as the sun. When we contemplate this vast machinery of omnipresent power, perceive this illimitable space and its innumerable worlds, it will become evident to us that the lifetime of this infinite creation is more than six thousand years; nay, it is very, very ancient.*

""***Notwithstanding this, we read in Genesis in the Old Testament that the lifetime of creation is but six thousand years. This has an inner meaning and significance; it is not to be taken literally.*** *For instance, it is said in the Old Testament that certain things were created in the first day. The narrative shows that at that time the sun was not yet created. How could we conceive of a day if no sun existed in the heavens? For the day depends upon the light of the sun. Inasmuch as the sun had not been made, how could the first day be realized? Therefore, these statements have significances other than literal.*

*""To be brief: Our purpose is to show that the divine sovereignty, the Kingdom of God, is an ancient sovereignty, that it is not an accidental sovereignty, just as a kingdom presupposes the existence of subjects, of an army, of a country; for otherwise the state of dominion, authority and kingdom cannot be conceived of. Therefore, if we should imagine that the creation is accidental, we would be forced to admit that the Creator is accidental, whereas the divine bounty is ever flowing, and the rays of the Sun of Truth are continuously shining. No cessation is possible to the divine bounty, just as no cessation is possible to the rays of the sun. This is clear and obvious.""*

karmavorous,"Are we talking vanilla?

In AP, I really really like the Ocelot. If I play Poisoned Paranid, I make a bee line for the Ocelot (getting a few million credits and high Split rep so I can buy it). And even once I get the Hyperion, I still spend a fair bit of time flying it. 

It's fast for a TP. 

It has a decent size cargo bay. 

It's shielded like a medium M3, and anything that it gives up to an M3 in terms of turning performance, it's mostly above my ability to control it. Like any M3 that turns better turns too fast for me to control anyway.

It can do any passenger transport mission. If you get one of those Extreme Tour Of A Lifetime missions, it can fight its way in and out of some of the Xenon sectors.

I put 8 Mass Drivers on the mains and EBCs on the turrets, but set them to Missiles Only because they will drain the laser energy even just defensively shooting at enemies. With 8 Mass Drivers on the mains, it can handily deal with Xenon PX (just stay out the PX's main gun arc). Down side of the Mass Drivers is that nobody ever bails, so it can slow down your fleet building through bails.

As soon as I can I build a factory to produce Hurricane missiles... or I spend some time in Zyarth's Dominion helping Split RRFs kill Xenon and collecting Hurricanes... because they're about the most useful missile that the Ocelot can fire.

It is probably my favorite buyable ship at any cost.",hwxqns4,t3_ssg3ox,/r/X3TC/comments/ssg3ox/which_ship_do_you_play_with_most/hwxqns4/,7,X3TC,False,0,2022-02-14

&gt; But rather than forcing the protesters out of Parliament grounds, police last night encouraged them to move their vehicles from the streets to the car park at Sky Stadium – where parking fees would be covered by Police.

&gt; This, together with a police statement on Sunday night that referred to the protests as “a lawful demonstration at Parliament,” sparked speculation police had received legal advice that it could not evict the crowd, which still numbered almost 1000 people yesterday.

&gt; Police declined to comment. “All legal advice is privileged, so we wouldn't comment on what we may or may not have received in that respect,” a spokesman said.

&gt; But legal experts said just because there are legal grounds to arrest someone, doesn’t mean the police should or will arrest that person.

&gt; “As a general rule, and this is based on history not the law, the police don’t go in and break up occupations very easily,” said Wellington barrister and legal blogger Graeme Edgeler, giving examples of occupations at Shelly Bay and Pākaitore, also known as Moutoa Gardens, as well as at Bastion Point.",hwxy6zd,t3_sshche,/r/newzealand/comments/sshche/wellington_protest_day_eight_thread_tow_truck/hwxy6zd/,7,newzealand,False,0,2022-02-14

It's also harder to secure supply routes into Black Marsh and to station troops there to defend from slavers. It's much easier for Morrowind to prevent slavery since they are the slavers, they just stop doing it. The Dominion would have to stop someone else from doing it instead.

^(By: J.R.R. Tolkien, Quirino Principe, Elémire Zolla | 1216 pages | Published: 1955 | Popular Shelves: owned, books-i-own, classic, sci-fi-fantasy, default)

&gt;One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
&gt;
&gt;In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.
&gt;
&gt;From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.
&gt;
&gt;When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.
&gt;
&gt;The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.

Bananas_Of_Paradise,"Well we can examine the angles and proportions of that horse thigh to safely determine that Cyrodiilic horses are modeled off of the Portuguese Lusitano breed, a hybrid of native horses and Arabian horses brought over during the Umayyad caliphate's invasion of Iberia. This shows that the imperial army had a large stock of high quality war horses; and according to baseless conjecture from an Imperial Knowledge video, we can confirm with certainty that the imperial legion had a larger cavalry contingent than the Aldmeri Dominion.

This is interesting because cavalry have generally been the domain of the nobility, something which Cyrodiil had a lot of. So when the majority of the Imperial army was destroyed in the Great War, there was likely a large loss of life among the nobility and a transfer of military culture from an aristocratic one to a more common military like the Roman military after the Marian reforms.

This change in military culture likely meant that the generals were more self-serving, which we can even see in Skyrim by the fact that Tullius is ""military governor"" and makes decisions unilaterally despite the fact that he's supposed to be upholding Elisif's claim to High Queen. I think this ties in to the theory that the Emperor had himself assassinated. You see, any transfer of power is risky business when the military could step in and take command at any moment. If Titus Mede II wanted his son to take power, he would've needed a way to preoccupy the military and stop them from interrupting the transfer of power. What better way than having his cousin assassinated in what would appear to be a Stormcloak attack, and then have himself assassinated not far from the same spot?

This escalates the war with the Stormcloaks and gives his son the support he needs to march in and reclaim Skyrim (which we know happens according to the letter in Pale Pass that changes depending on which side you take) while also making the situation too delicate for any upstart generals to upset the power balance in Cyrodiil.",hx0y75v,t3_ssyibr,/r/TrueSTL/comments/ssyibr/lore_implications_or_unicorussy/hx0y75v/,66,TrueSTL,False,1,2022-02-15

Galaxy_Megatron,"&gt;Uuuh, Isla Sorna? As far as I know it still there. Was it destroyed by a volcano too? Did I miss something?

Yes. As far as the film is concerned, the public is led to believe Isla Nublar is the last place on the planet with dinosaurs. It's not explained, it just is. In canon tie-in material, the Dinosaur Protection Group website, there's a report that addressed the issue, although it was still pretty vague. The report said Sorna experienced a large population drop due to the introduction of the 1999 illegally cloned species (Spinosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Ankylosaurus, Corythosaurus are the only named species but the wording said ""including""), while also expressing other theories, such as disease and poaching. A canon JW prequel novel titled The Evolution of Claire briefly mentioned Sorna, with Masrani claiming that there were ""enough"" dinosaurs on it and that the biggest issue the island faced was illegal poaching; mind you, this novel takes place largely in 2004, which is a couple years after the construction of Jurassic World began (in 2002) and after the proposed mysterious drop in Sorna's population. On top of that, there have been a couple interviews with one of the head writers for the DPG, Jack Ewins, where he's basically surmised that Sorna's status was left intentionally ambiguous for future writers to work with, pointing out that the island is still owned by Masrani Global and restricted, as well as alluding to the ""fake news"" aspect of things. And on top of all of that, Camp Cretaceous (which is canon) season 4 introduced a new island separate from Nublar and the Five Deaths, that has some animals that a rival company stole from Sorna, namely a pair of Tyrannosaurus and the Spinosaurus. That would lead one to believe there must still be something of a functional ecosystem on Sorna for two Tyrannosaurus to be healthy and have reached adulthood without deformities or otherwise, and for the Spinosaurus to not have starved to death or look malnourished.

Phew.

&gt;Just capture them all again just like they did in Lost World and in Fallen Kingdom, and in JW I assume, since you had to put all the freeroaming dinosaurs in a proper enclosure. There is like 30 animals at max anyway and most of them are so huge it is impossible to miss, for fuck sake.

The animals escaping from Lockwood's estate aren't the problem. The danger was that technology getting into the outside world. Beforehand, it was almost exclusively InGen that had the means and capability to clone prehistoric creatures. Now, that's open-source, and like Dominion showed in the trailer, there are more species loose in the world because other companies can make their own. That's why the shot of the blood and embryos in the silver briefcase at the end is significant, which is something Colin Trevorrow has clarified in interviews.

&gt;Blue had a chick? Wasn't she the last of her species? Do they reproduce assexually now?

Apparently Blue can; not sure about other species. This reproduction was introduced in Jurassic World Aftermath, which was canon but now isn't, so I'm guessing the devs got word from Trevorrow and brought the element into their game.

The rest of what you said I pretty much agree with or don't have any strong opinion on.",hx09aop,t3_ssmarn,/r/CharacterRant/comments/ssmarn/jurassic_world_disrespects_its_dinosaurs/hx09aop/,12,CharacterRant,False,0,2022-02-15

""This all makes more sense if the “he” of this chapter is seen as Israel, not Jesus—Israel was punished through the Babylonian exile and will be returned to glory and power.""

It's more post-hoc analysis of the Babylonian occupation. And since prophecy can only be divine if *every part of it is true* we can successfully rule out Jesus as Israel's Messiah by examining the full body of Messianic prophecy. For example:

https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/108400/jewish/The-End-of-Days.htm

&gt; One of the principles of Jewish faith enumerated by Maimonides is that one day there will arise a dynamic Jewish leader, a direct descendant of the Davidic dynasty, who will rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, and gather Jews from all over the world and bring them back to the Land of Israel.

We don't know that Jesus was a singular historical figure (all the historians who do are also theologians, so take that with a grain of salt). We know that Jesus did *not* rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem, nor did he gather all the Jews from all over the world and bring them back to the land of Israel. To that last point, de Gaul, Churchill and Truman are closer to fulfilling that prophecy than Jesus.

&gt; All the nations of the world will recognize Moshiach to be a world leader, and will accept his dominion. In the messianic era there will be world peace, no more wars nor famine, and, in general, a high standard of living.

No one but a handful of people recognized Jesus as a leader during his alleged ministry, and he certainly never held dominion over the world. We have never had world peace, rarely had years without war or famine and the era of the highest standard of living is today but it is by no means a global standard.

LateNightPhilosopher,"The Defiant seems to be the first Starfleet vessel who's armor is actually able to stand up to contemporary weapons. All other starships seem to crumple in seconds like tissue paper when not protected by shields.

But even then her armor doesn't last forever. I'm sure a clever crew on a refit older ship could take out a defiant. Even THE Defiant. And as much as people in these comments seem to think Warf would he considered the superior captain in most fights, the fact is that he regularly gives in to impulsiveness and makes mistakes. I'd be interested to see how a clever crew in a refit older ship might be able to goad Warf into exposing the Defiant for a volley of Quantum torpedoes. Honestly I'd be willing to bet that even a very heavily refit Miranda or Soyuz (they're roughly the same size as Defiant but at least a century older) could take out a ship like the Defiant if they were turned into a quantum torpedo boat and managed to land the first unshielded hit.

Imo the reason the Mirandas had such heavy losses against the dominion was that Starfleet DIDN'T properly refit them for modern warfare. They were about the right size for a torpedo boat and could probably have been refit with an oversized warp core to power extra tough shields and more weapons, but instead starfleet were just throwing research vessels to the front lines.

TrackerNineEight,"Someone made a really good long post elsewhere on this sub a few months ago about how paleo nerds get involved in the Jurassic franchise because it's basically the only game in town as far as mainstream dino media goes. And how there's a silent agreement among movie studios that Universal ""owns"" the concept of dinosaurs, one piece of evidence being the surge of high-budget dinosaur documentaries between 2001 and 2015 that died the moment World released.

As far as park builders go, I do expect some of the hardcore nerds to move on to Prehistoric Kingdom once it fully releases, but some of us will still be here and will keep musing about possibilities, doesn't mean we think the Jurassic look is bad. (I'll always have a soft spot for the JP3 Spino)

CatOfRivia,"**Third Age**

*The Return of the Shadow*

Sauron occupies South Greenwood and turns it to South Mirkwood and establishes Dol Guldur.

Galadriel returns to Lorien to aid Lorien against Dol Guldur. "" In her wisdom Galadriel saw that Lórien would be a stronghold and point of power to prevent the Shadow from crossing the Anduin in the war that must inevitably come before it was againdefeated (if that were possible); but that it needed a rule of greaterstrength and wisdom than the Silvan folk possessed."" - UT

*Long travels of Galadriel*

Sometime later Galadriel started travelling around, again. ""after long journeys of enquiry in Rhovanion, from Gondorand the borders of Mordor to Thranduil in the north, Celeborn and Galadriel passed over the mountains to Imladris, and there dwelt formany years"" - ibid

Imladris was at war with Angmar. Galadriel must've helped Imladris one way or another against Angmar. She had many useful skills. 

*The Return of the Queen*

The Dwarves awoke the Balrog. Moria fell. Lorien fell under heavier threats. King of Lorien abandoned Lorien because of... Long story... King of Lorien got drowned in an unfortunate accident in the Sea. ""its people fleeing andlikely to leave it deserted to be occupied by Orcs, that Galadriel andCeleborn [returned from Rivendell and] took up their permanent abode in Lórien, and itsgovernment."" They ""were welcomed by the people.There they dwelt while the Third Age lasted, but they took no title ofKing or Queen; for they said that they were only guardians of thissmall but fair realm, the last eastward outpost of the Elves."" - UT

Although Galadriel rejected the title of the Queen, Tolkien four times called her Queen from his own perspective, and one time from Gimli's perspective. 

Galadriel established the city of Caras Galadhon the Fortress of Trees. 

Galadriel turned Lorien into its greatest level of beauty and strength.

She sang many golden trees into existence.

It was probably at this time that Galadriel changed the name of this land. This land was actually originally named Lindórinand (‘Vale of the Land of the Singers’) in later versions. Galadriel renamed it to Lorien/Lothlorien, Laurelindórinan ('the Valley of Singing Gold'). These names resemble some of the favorite things of Galadriel in her younger days. Lorien was the garden of the Vala Irmo in Valinor. And Laurelin was the name of the Golden Tree of Yavanna.

""the resemblance cannot be accidental. She had endeavoured to makeLórien a refuge and an island of peace and beauty, a memorial ofancient days, but was now filled with regret and misgiving, knowingthat the golden dream was hastening to a grey awakening."" - UT 

Galadriel's ""longing increased year by year, to at last, an overwhelming regret"".

Thanks to the teachings of Melian, and with the amplifying of her power by using Nenya, Galadriel managed to create a very powerful protection force over Lorien.

*The White Council*

Galadriel formed the White Council to answer the threat of Dol Guldur and offered her friend Gandalf to become the lead of the council. Gandalf refused the office. To Galadriel's dismay the council chose Saruman as the leader instead. Saruman soon became corrupted and became a great obstacle against Gandalf and his supporters. 

*the Ride of Eorl*

Gondor was very close to destruction. Eorl and his army rode from the North to save Gondor. Near Dol Guldur was a place of enemies but there was no sign of them. It is kinda implied it was Galadriel's doing: ""for greater powers were at work"". 

The Necromancer tried to prevent the Riders by sending Shadows of Terror against them. When they had lost hope, suddenly out of Lorien came a magic mist that broke the sorcery of the Necromancer and drove away the Glooms and shielded and powered up and sped up the entire army of the Riders of the North. 

'The Lady of the Golden Wood is on our side' 

 They arrived to the battle in Gondor with 'wings' upon the feet of their horses.

""Then the fortunes of battle were reversed,and the enemy was driven with slaughter ...""

Then Gondor gifted Northern Men a land which became known as Rohan and they swore to come to eachothers aid whenever there's the need for it.

Thus Galadriel formed the strongest alliance in Third Age. 

More details can be found in Cirion and Eorl chapter in Unfinished Tales. 

*The Attack of the White Council*

Gandalf discovered the real identity of the Necromancer of Dol Guldur. 

Gandalf feared Sauron has become strong enough to conquer Lorien and urged Saruman to attack now. Saruman delayed the attack for almost 100 years.

Sauron was alerted and had made plans of escape, and when the White Council attacked Dol Guldur, Sauron fled before them and returned to the East. 

*Galadriel the matchmaker*

Aragorn was in the way to Rivendell and he came near the Fences of Galadriel and he was admitted by the Lady to Lorien.

""He did not know it, but Arwen Undómiel was also there, ...., and Galadriel bade him cast aside his wayworn raiment, and she clothed him in silver and white, with a cloak of elven-grey and a bright gem on his brow. Then more than any kind of Men he appeared, and seemed rather an Elf-lord from the Isles of theWest. And thus it was that Arwen first beheld him again after their long parting; and as he came walking towards her under the trees of Caras Galadhon laden with flowers of gold, her choice was made and her doom appointed."" - Appendix 

*The Hunt for the Ring*

Witch-King and his fellow Nazgul gathered together. He thought he may find the One Ring in Lorien. ""But the power of the White Ring he would not defy"", nor would he enter Lorien. 

*The saviour of the Fellowship*

Galadriel safeguarded the Fellowship for a month. 

She gave them many advises and tested them. 

Galadriel gave several gifts to the Fellowship that saved them hundreds of times. Many of these gifts were made by herself. One of her most impressive gifts was her own version of the Silmaril; for she had captured the Light of the Silmaril of Earendil into her Phial. 

(I shortened it up a lot here) 

*The friend maker*

Celeborn insulted Gimli and his kin. Galadriel rebuked Celeborn and backed up Gimli and his kin against her husband, Gimli's entire perspective on Elves changed. He became the best friend of Legolas. 

*The hardest thing Galadriel ever done in her life*

Frodo offered her the Great Ring. It is said the temptation of the evil Ring was overwhelming on her. For ""atlast all that she had desired in her youth came to her hand, the Ring ofPower and the dominion of Middle-earth of which she had dreamed,""

If she takes The One Ring, it would eventually turn her into an evil Queen but

this was her only chance to save her land, her life and her dreams. She thought if she rejects this offer she will diminish under the Curse of Mandos until she dies and as a ghost goes to the Halls of Mandos God of Death in the West. She knew her land would be destroyed whether Frodo may be successful in his Quest or whether Sauron gets his Ring back. Lorien was turned into a Timeless Land with the power of Galadriel's Ring. And since all Rings were fated to the One Ring, all Rings would lose power with the destruction of the One Ring. And Lorien would fall under decay and fading. And Elves, especially High-Elves, cannot endure the passing of time in the decay of the world. They need to go to the Timeless Lands of the Valar. But Galadriel was banned from there. She was cursed to fade away and diminish until she dies in Middle-earth.  'Slain ye shall be; by weapon or by torment or by grief.' She was doomed to pass away to Mandos. She needed this Ring to save her life and her land and her dreams. It was impossible for her to reject the Ring. But she did the impossible. ""her wisdom was full grown and she rejected it,"" - SoF

*Friendship of Lorien with Dwarves revived*

After Dwarves caused many sorrows for Lorien by awakening the Balrog and many terrors, the Elves of Lorien became bitter against Dwarves. But nonetheless Galadriel always loved the Dwarves.

Gimli named his desire, a single strand of Galadriel's hair to set it in a crystal as symbol of unending friendship between Elves and Dwarves. Galadriel gave him three (suck it Feanor!). She outright said no one had ever asked me something so bold and YET SO COURTEOUS. 

*Saving Gandalf*

Galadriel sent the Lord of the Eagles to find Gandalf and bring him to her. He had returned to life. The Eagle found him on top of the misty mountains and brought him to her and she healed his body.

*Advice for Aragorn*

Galadriel sent a message to Aragorn and told him he should summon the Oathbreakers. (Later when Elrond sent a similar message Aragorn decided to summon the army of the dead) 

*Reinforcements for Aragorn*

Galadriel sent the Dunedain Rangers to aid Aragorn. 

*the Battles of Lorien vs Dol Guldur*

""Three times Lórien had been assailed from Dol Guldur, but besides the valour of the elven people of that land, the power that dwelt there was too great for any to overcome, unless Sauron had come there himself.""

The Second Assault was led by Khamul and the other two Nazgul of Dol Guldur. 

"" when the Shadow passed, Celeborn came forth and led the host of Lórien over Anduin in many boats. They took Dol Guldur, and Galadriel threw down its walls and laid bare its pits, and the forest was cleansed."" - Appendix 

*Galadriel, the last survivor of the Rebel Leaders, broke the Curse of Mandos*

AIPhilosophy,"Ulfric states that he wants to make peace with the Empire after the PC wins the war for him. I don't think that there's any evidence that he'd refuse to ally with the Empire against the Dominion so long as the Empire respected Skyrim's independence, but the Empire accepting Skyrim's independence would be a big ""IF"" and necessary component for peace anyway. I personally believe that a Stormcloak victory would likely lead to such an alliance, however.

One could likely make arguments that the Empire would make better use of the resources of Skyrim than the Stormcloaks could, but I don't think there's enough evidence either way to form much of an argument.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding more general support for the Stormcloaks... Well my reasons are complicated, but it effectively comes down to real-life political beliefs (which I largely don't think I can discuss due to the rules of this sub) regarding the self-determination rights of nations and anti-imperialism, plus a lot of little things which turn me off from the Empire. Also I think the whole racism accusation thing is somewhat lacking in evidence, though unsurprising considering how racism-coded the Stormcloaks are from a modern perspective. And Ulfric is bae, so there's that. :p

I think there's often a legitimate debate to be had regarding the issue, so it's unfortunate (from my perspective, at least) that the communities I love slowly turned into decidedly pro-Empire spaces.

TrumpSharted,"&gt;The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol subpoenaed two of Donald J. Trump’s campaign aides and Republican Party officials from battleground states on Tuesday as it dug deeper into a plan to use false slates of electors to help the former president stay in office after he lost the 2020 election.

&gt;The use of bogus slates of electors was one of the more audacious gambits employed by allies of Mr. Trump to try to keep the presidency in his hands, and the committee’s members and investigators have made it increasingly clear in recent days that they believe the effort — along with proposals to seize voting machines — was a major threat to democracy.

&gt;Among those subpoenaed on Tuesday were Michael A. Roman and Gary Michael Brown, who served as the director and the deputy director of Election Day operations for Mr. Trump’s campaign. The panel also summoned Douglas V. Mastriano, a Pennsylvania state senator; Laura Cox, the former chairwoman of Michigan’s Republican Party; Mark W. Finchem, an Arizona state legislator; and Kelli Ward, the chairwoman of Arizona’s Republican Party.

&gt;In letters accompanying the subpoenas, the committee said it had obtained communications that showed Mr. Roman’s and Mr. Brown’s “involvement in a coordinated strategy to contact Republican members of state legislatures in certain states that former President Trump had lost and urge them to ‘reclaim’ their authority by sending an alternate slate of electors that would support former President Trump.”

&gt;“It appears that you helped direct the Trump campaign staffers participating in this effort,” Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the committee, wrote to Mr. Roman.
The committee said that Mr. Finchem, who was on the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, was in communication with leaders from the “Stop the Steal” movement regarding a rally at the Capitol, and that Mr. Finchem said he was in Washington to “deliver an evidence book and letter to Vice President Pence showing key evidence of fraud in the Arizona presidential election, and asking him to consider postponing the award of electors.”

&gt;In its letter to Ms. Cox, the panel said it had evidence that she witnessed Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, pressure state lawmakers to disregard the election results in favor of Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Michigan and say that certifying the election results would be a “criminal act.”

&gt;After the November election was over, Ms. Ward sent a message to an Arizona elections official warning to “stop the counting,” according to the committee. She also “apparently spoke with former President Trump and members of his staff about election certification issues in Arizona” and “posted a video advancing unsubstantiated theories of election interference by Dominion Voting Systems along with a link to a donation page to benefit the Arizona Republican Party,” the committee said.

&gt;Ms. Ward also claimed to be an “alternate” elector for Mr. Trump, even though Mr. Biden won Arizona.

&gt;Ms. Ward has already filed a lawsuit to try to block the committee from gaining access to logs of her phone calls.

&gt;The committee said Mr. Mastriano spoke directly with Mr. Trump about the legislator’s postelection activities. Mr. Mastriano, a former Army officer, was also on the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, though he later explained in a statement that “he followed the directions of the Capitol Police and respected all police lines” that day.

&gt;The subpoenas instruct the witnesses to produce documents and sit for depositions in March.

&gt;“The select committee is seeking information about efforts to send false slates of electors to Washington and change the outcome of the 2020 election,” Mr. Thompson said, adding, “The select committee has heard from more than 550 witnesses, and we expect these six individuals to cooperate as well as we work to tell the American people the full story about the violence of Jan. 6 and its causes.”

&gt;The scheme to employ the so-called alternate electors was one of Mr. Trump’s most expansive efforts to overturn the election, beginning even before some states had finished counting ballots and culminating in the pressure placed on Mr. Pence to throw out legitimate votes for Mr. Biden when he presided over the joint congressional session to finalize the election outcome.

&gt;At various times, the gambit involved lawyers, state lawmakers and top White House aides.

&gt;The New York Times reported this month on legal memos that show some of the earliest known origins of what became the rationale for the use of alternate electors.",hx3o6iy,t3_stgeoq,/r/MarchAgainstNazis/comments/stgeoq/jan_6_inquiry_subpoenas_6_tied_to_false_protrump/hx3o6iy/,6,MarchAgainstNazis,True,0,2022-02-15

sammyboi558,"My speculation is that this rarely works because of (1) misconceptions of veganism and (2) psychological defense mechanisms.   

The reason carnism was coined in the first place was to describe the invisible beliefs that are so pervasive on the acceptability of paying for the mass slaughter of certain animals. Just being around someone who is leading by example generally won't be sufficient to dispel this deeply ingrained belief system, imo.  

Also, psychological defense mechanisms will keep people from reflecting critically on their own actions unless seriously prompted. Without taking the time to seriously reflect on their own actions, someone is just going to deflect any notion of becoming vegan thanks to their psychological defense mechanisms.   

So, yeah, basically people who have become adults with carnism being a pervasive belief system underlying their justifications for buying animal products are going to continue being carnists unless they do serious self-reflection to evaluate their morals. This is rarely done unprompted.

dobby_rams,"Probably a few centuries, but we know the least about the Eliksni's past. 

We probably know of roughly three eras of the Eliksni. The first is when the ""Skaith"" ruled, and this period is basically completely forgotten. Then there is the period of the ""Elders"", who are also almost completely forgotten, though the Eliksni still follow some of the traditions of that period. The Prison of the Elders is probably the most notable. Then there's the period of the Houses, which is the one we have the most information of. 

&gt; ""Your scribes, your Kells, your Houses—they will all soon be forgotten, like the Elders and the Skaith before them,"" Fikrul growled in Variks's precious High Speak of Judgment.

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/where-loyalty-lies

We don't actually know which of these periods the Traveler arrived in, but we do know that the Eliksni began to spread across multiple star systems under the Traveler:

&gt; ""Eliksni once ruled many stars. Now we fight for one not our own."" —Variks 

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/items/last-battle

Variks describes a time during the Eliksni Golden Age in which they turned to piracy and scavenging, which resulted in a war called the Edge Wars. We don't really know much about this war, but given its name, I think it's possible that the various Fallen factions turned on each other as they fought for territory on the edge of the ever-expanding Eliksni dominion.

Variks blames these days on a lack of hierarchy. He says that the Eliksni had no trust, no honour, and no way to be necessary. The Edge Wars were later ended when Craask, the Kell of Kings, and the House of Judgment joined together to end the war and united the Houses together. 

&gt; But Judgment, true Judgment, required hierarchy. And Eliksni hierarchy died with the fall of the Houses. The Guardians had picked them apart, Kell by Kell, Prime by Prime. Now, there was all but nothing left of his culture—only pirates and scavengers and lone wolves like the days before the Edge Wars. No trust, no honor, no way to be… necessary.
&gt; 
&gt; Yet one final hope among the Eliksni still thrived. Craask, Kell of Kings. The Kings understood Judgment, for together they ended the Edge Wars in their people's golden age. Craask. His last hope to see his dreams of a united Eliksni made manifest. He must make contact.

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/job-undone

He describes this period in a little bit more detail to Eido:

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/illuminus-cloak-majestic

We also know during that by the time the Traveler arrived on Riis, it was finding it harder and harder to leave the civilisations it uplifted:

&gt; This world is rich with family.
&gt; 
&gt; You pause to rest. Life is a balm. You must cherish it where you find it.
&gt; 
&gt; You do not mean to stay, but longing and kinship forestalls your departure time and time again. These little gardeners are such careful stewards of fragility. They sing songs of disasters averted and loved ones lost. They fashion heavy elements combed from the bones of old stars into objects of peace and beauty.
&gt; 
&gt; You must force yourself to be cruel. Your presence is portent.

This led to the Traveler fleeing the Darkness at the very last possible moment, which resulted in some of the Eliksni feeling abandoned and enraged. 

&gt;Variks: Ours was a world of prosperity and peace. Not unlike your Golden Age. We worshipped the Great Machine. But fate intervened. With it, came a whirlwind of destruction. In the chaos, the Great Machine fled... abandoning us all. Eramis, like most, was consumed by rage. In the wake of loss, Eramis rebuilt a life. Found new family, one forged from anger. Eramis saw only destruction of that which abandoned us. Variks fears for Eliksni lives. At the command of Eramis, they will meet their end. We all do. We must all make choices. Eramis chose herself over her people. If Eramis is to succeed, the Great Machine and all who follow it... will meet their end. In Darkness, there is only one truth... death. 

https://youtu.be/vTPJak8dZxs

Chelchis, the Kell of Stone, stood before the Darkness and allowed his people to escape the Whirlwind.

&gt; ""Where is the Great Machine? Where is the Great Machine?"" —Chelchis, Kell of Stone

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/items/doom-of-chelchis

&gt; ""All is silent. Nothing answers me. The hunger comes."" —Chelchis, Kell of Stone

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/items/doom-of-chelchis-adept

&gt; Eliksni songs still tell of Chelchis, Kell of Stone, who stood before the Maw.

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/items/broken-crown

After this came the period that the Eliksni refer to as the ""Long Drift"", which is essentially the period in which they were in pursuit of the Traveler. 

&gt; We have not been still since the Long Drift, and we will never be still again.

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/salvations-grip

During this period, the Houses once again began to fight amongst each other:

&gt; First , the Great Machine. Then, sky fell away. Whirlwind ripped away the past. All honor lost, all hope. Judgment not
&gt; enough. Cannot keep Wolves from Kings, Scar from Winter. Fell to fighting. Fell to hate.

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/variks-the-loyal

The role of the Archons also grew during this period due to the Fallen's new dependence on machines. This was also the period in which Servitors were built in the Traveler's image, to replace the Ether that the Traveler could no longer give them.

&gt; Archons had long been elevated in Fallen society, but their stature grew, and their role shifted following the Whirlwind. As desperation took hold and the last of the Fallen raced across the stars in search of salvation, their dependence on machines evolved into a deep-rooted need—their weapons to fight, their ships to fly, their Servitors to survive.

https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/an-evolution-of-faith

&gt; Tyra: Did you know that Servitors are a relatively new invention of the Fallen? They begin to appear in the records shortly after the event they call the Whirlwind. Quite an interesting correlation, don’t you think?

https://youtu.be/kmg4olePQjI

And then, obviously, the Fallen finally arrived in Sol shortly after the Collapse. It's never really made clear whether they were waiting for the Darkness to pick apart humanity before swooping in, or if they just happened to arrive in that period. But as a civilisation they were in a very hateful state, and they wiped out much of the remnants of humanity that were trying to recover from the Collapse. This is because many believe that humanity ""stole"" the Traveler from them, and they believe that it was rightfully theirs to clam,",hx5gezf,t3_stqk2h,/r/DestinyLore/comments/stqk2h/how_long_was_the_traveller_on_the_eliksnis_planet/hx5gezf/,29,DestinyLore,False,1,2022-02-16
WellSpokenAsianBoy,"Here's my take: the Miranda was the work horse of the Fleet at the Kirk era and with peace with the Klingons they were easily repurposed for other missions.  They need a small crew, you can slap a roll bar on them for added firepower or sensor pods.  They were the backbone of the fleet and Starfleet ship design philosophy was just to make newer experimental designs in relatively smaller amounts to see what worked and what didn't but rely on Mirandas and Excelsiors to pick up the slack.  Because this was an era of relative peace between the time of Kirk and the time of Picard this was fine.  Isolated conflicts or short border wars could be handled by heavy cruisers like the Ambassador or frigates like the New Orleans Class and Mirandas and Excelsiors just did everything else.  

Just as the Mirandas were supposed to be phased out then Wolf 359 happens.  So Starfleet has to rebuild their fleet and while they do that they fall back on the Mirandas and Excelsiors already in service.  There are so many of them and they are easily upgradeable that Starfleet relies on them even as they design Defiant Classes and Intrepid classes and Sovereign Classes.  Because conflict increases post Wolf-359 with the reemergence of the Romulans and ultimately the Dominion War Starfleet can't afford to go back to their old philosophy of single hero ships saving the day.  They need to go on full military footing and they need tough rigged proven ships that they can rely on.

Did_Gyre_And_Gimble,"I think there's a difference between sex (biological) and gender (social construct).  What it means to be ""a woman"" is a loaded question in that it conflates the two.  

Is this person *biologically* female?  No.  Are they - and do they have a right to assert that they are - female by way of social construct?  Sure.  Why not?  Who am I to say otherwise?

I'm an old fart stuck in his ways - my brain will never be able to wrap itself around this concept in any kind of intuitive way.  But I can understand that ""what it means to be a woman"" is a question that very, very much depends on social context.  Ultimately, ""gender"" is really just a made up thing.  SEX is real.  But gender?  That's a question of how we see people, how we think of people, what role they play within society, and how they see themselves.  If this is wildly different from culture to culture - and it is - then it's ultimately just a wishy washy concept over which no one gets to assert dominion.

If \[person\] asserts their gender is female, what does that even *mean*?  They like dresses and playing with dolls?  They want to wear their hair long?  They feel more comfortable shitting in the lady's room?  They want to earn 80 cents on the dollar?  What?

What if a male wants these things?  Does he have to be female to hold these characteristics?

Who am I to say ... whatever *that* is?

And how does it hurt me to respect people's request that I use the names and pronouns that make them feel comfortable in their won skin?

.....

Soo.. all that's to say this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do you honestly think that the man that identifies as a woman is actually a woman?

Sex:  no.

Gender:  this concept has no meaning to me, so I don't assert any authoritative answers.  All I can do is mind my own damned business and let people live their lives the way they want.

Jolly_Jotunn,"Admiral Leyton and Captain Benteen were both confident that the Lakota could defeat the Defiant before the battle, both ships were holding back ( Benteen refused to use quantium torpedoes against the Defiant), and the Defiant was crewed by veteran hero characters up against inexperienced redshirts under a new captain (commander and crew can make a big difference in a Star Trek ship battle!) 

We don’t really have any reason to treat this as a definitive result, it probably could have gone either way with comparable crew. 

Fans tend to discount 24th Century era Excelsior class ships, but Starfleet wouldn’t use them if they weren’t worthwhile. The Excelsior is a heavy cruiser with 500 or 600 odd crew, that is a lot of resources and crew to expand on a ship, it would be highly irresponsible for Starfleet to still use them if they weren’t competitive designs when upgraded. And throughout TNG and DS9, Starfleet seems to demonstrate a great deal of confidence in the Excelsior class; it’s the most common non-hero Starfleet ship that we see throughout TNG and DS9, and the ship is the backbone of the Fleets that the Federation sends out to fight the Dominion.",hx3yhtz,t3_stdmrm,/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/stdmrm/a_defiantclass_ship_could_defeat_a_refitexcelsior/hx3yhtz/,17,DaystromInstitute,False,0,2022-02-16

orojinn,"The leaders Own word to the Press. Do not try to gaslight evidence below the truth is from their own words.


THE ORGANIZERS
JAMES BAUDER: James Bauder is the founder of Canada Unity, one of the groups responsible for the initial organization of the convoy to Ottawa. 

Ahead of the convoy’s arrival in the capital, Canada Unity directed a “Memorandum of Understanding” (MOU) to the Senate and the Governor General, demanding an end to vaccine mandates and the reinstatement of those who lost jobs over COVID-19 vaccinations, or else “RESIGN their lawful positions of authority Immediately” (sic). 

Bauder said in a video posted to social media in January that he hoped the MOU would provide a “referendum” to persuade Elections Canada to trigger an election, which is not within the agency’s constitutional powers. 


In the same video, Bauder said the hoped-for election would be legitimate because Canada does not use the Dominion voting machines at the centre of rigged-election conspiracy theories about the 2020 U.S. presidential vote. Dominion Voting is suing Fox News for defamation after the news outlet’s TV personalities suggested widespread vote-switching contributed to Donald Trump’s election loss. 

As of Feb. 8, Canada Unity had pulled the MOU from their website, writing in a statement signed by Bauder that it had led to “unintended interpretations,” and a message on the homepage also tells visitors the website has moved. Neither explanation nor a link to a new website were provided. 

In December 2020, Bauder posted on Facebook about his skepticism over the origins of COVID-19, perpetuating the disproven belief that the virus was intentionally created in and leaked from a lab in Wuhan, China, as a bioweapon and wrongly implied that billionaire George Soros may have been involved. Soros is often the subject of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories spread online. 

TAMARA LICH: Tamara Lich is listed alongside BJ Dichter as one of the ""official"" spokespeople for the convoy in Ottawa and is one of the organizers of the fundraising page that raised more than $10 million for the convoy before it was removed by GoFundMe. Since then, Lich has said the protesters can receive funds through other means, including the Christian crowdfunding site GiveSendGo where the group had raised more than US$8.1 million by Feb. 10.

Lich, who claims Metis heritage, was initially a member of the Wildrose Party before moving to Manitoba and joining the Maverick Party, which says its goal is to represent the interests of Western Canada. On Feb. 2, a statement was posted on the Maverick Party accepting the resignation of Lich, “as she is committed to remaining in Ottawa until all restrictions are lifted.”

BJ DICHTER: Benjamin Dichter, also known as BJ Dichter, is a truck driver and podcaster who describes himself as vice-president of the Ottawa convoy. 

Dichter has previously run for office, losing in the 2015 election as a Conservative MP candidate in the riding of Toronto-Danforth. At a People’s Party of Canada event in 2019, Dichter made a speech in which he suggested Canada is suffering from the “stench” of “political Islam"" and stated without providing evidence that some then-candidates for the Conservative Party of Canada had ties to ""Islamic extremism.""


A Feb. 9 statement posted to Dichter’s Twitter said he is now one of four authorized spokespeople for the convoy. Before a press conference scheduled for the same day, Dichter tweeted that The Globe and Mail had been uninvited after publishing an opinion piece criticizing the alt-right’s use of the word “freedom.” 

When Confederate flags were seen in the convoy in Ottawa, Dichter said in a Twitter Space livestream with former Rebel Media presenters Keean Bexte and Lauren Southern that he didn’t care about their presence.

“Let’s assume there were guys there who did have a Confederate flag,” he said. “They believe in the confederacy of states rights in a foreign nation? I don’t care.”

At an informal press conference Feb. 7, Dichter has also said that the convoy has had some Conservative MPs reach out “behind the scenes.” 

Before he was an “official” spokesperson for the convoys, Dichter went on far-right Fox personality Tucker Carlson’s show on Jan. 27, telling Carlson that driving through Alberta before the pandemic, he thought it looked like a “third-world country” because the trucking industry had been “crushed.”

CHRIS BARBER: Chris Barber is a truck driver from Saskatchewan and one of the organizers of the convoy to Ottawa. Barber is active on social media, including TikTok, providing updates on the protest in Ottawa.

In one such update posted to TikTok, Barber refers to snipers' presence near the Parliament Hill protest, suggests that his ""sources"" tell him riot police are headed to Ottawa, and that the convoy may ""go dark"" after having their telecommunications blacked out.

""When our phones go dark, that means – I'm going to put my tin-foil hat on – they've deployed the 'no cell phone service' thing,"" he said in the video.

Snipers are often present at large protests on or near Parliament Hill, and while it is possible for police to trace phones used in downtown Ottawa, it is not possible for the government to black out the cell phones and internet of just those participating in the protest.

Barber calls the COVID-19 vaccine mandates ""tyranny at its finest"" and compares the policy to the strict government oversight of North Korea, even though some Canadian students in Ontario and New Brunswick have long been required to be immunized against other diseases including tetanus, polio, measles and chickenpox under the Immunization of School Pupils Act (though this is not required in other provinces).

Barber also said in a subsequent TikTok that he has Confederate flags hanging on his wall at home, calling it a ""piece of cloth"" and telling viewers to ""get over it."" The Confederate flag was used as a battle flag during the American civil war by those fighting on the side of the Confederates, who supported the continuation of slavery in the U.S.",hx8am5f,t3_su4zlb,/r/canada/comments/su4zlb/conservatives_say_they_wont_support_emergencies/hx8am5f/,16,canada,False,0,2022-02-16

&amp;#x200B;

**A pearl for your thoughts**

Unlike the Iguanid Empire, where the currency is strictly regulated by the imperial authorities, the Dominion has no strict exchange policy. While imperial coins are becoming more relevant, the peoples of the Dominion still utilize pearls, shells, and particular seeds as their preferred form of currency.

**Pearl farming in Odir**

Due to its massive underwater structure, the statue-island of Odir is the perfect location for pearl farming. Pearl farms are owned by the local Tritonid clans, who also own a series of pearl vaults in the depths of the underwater city. Odir is particularly renowned for its highly sought dark pearls, often sold for stratospheric prices.

**Odir Pearls - Average Value**

Dark pearl (perfect): 150-250 golden imperials

Dark pearl (imperfect): 50-150 golden imperials

White pearl (perfect): 25-50 golden imperials

White pearl (imperfect): 3-25 golden imperials

ExpectedBehaviour,"&gt;I really don’t think we have any reason to think that an Intrepid is comparable to a Galaxy class ship in combat ability, or that it’s at all obvious one could win against a Defiant or upgraded Excelsior. They are fast ships sure, but they are much smaller than a Galaxy or even an Older Exclesior, they seem to be more long range science ships than dedicated warships like the Defiant class. They don’t carry quantum torpedoes, Starfleet never sends them out to fight in the major fleet battles with the Dominion.

Starfleet sent out *Mirandas* against the Dominion and *Oberths* against the borg. Clearly they aren't necessarily all that fussy when it came to the combat effectiveness of every ship they put on the front line.

The Doylist explanation, of course, is that they didn't want *Intrepid*\-class ships appearing in *DS9* in case it confused the poor viewers. Remember, these are the people who didn't want the *Defiant* to be called the *Valiant* because it began with the same letter as *Voyager*...

The Watsonian explanation is probably along the lines of ""the newer classes of ships were charged with non-combat duties to keep the Federation running, since they were faster and could deal better with unexpected ambushes or lack of support ships"" – we never see a *Sovereign* fighting the Dominion either, though there's no doubt they were amongst the most powerful ships Starfleet had at the time.

While *Voyager* wasn't carrying quantum torpedoes, it doesn't mean the *Intrepid*\-class can't be fitted with them. The first mention of quantum torpedoes is in DS9: ""Defiant"", stardate 48467.3; *Voyager* had already been lost by then (stardate 48315.6 was after they'd arrived in the Delta Quadrant). Per the *DS9 Technical Manual*, Deep Space 9 and the *Defiant* accounted for 50% of all Starfleet's initial quantum torpedo supplies; it makes sense that being as it was on a short shakedown mission to the Badlands that *Voyager* wouldn't have any constrained munitions installed. And *Voyager* did have tricobalt warheads aboard, which were non-standard heavy armaments with a less limited availability than quantum torpedoes in 2371.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When it comes down to it, we don’t have a lot to go on when comparing Intrepids against other ships from the Alpha and Beta quadrants; the only ship from the Alpha/Beta area Voyager goes up against is an old Klingon Battle cruiser that had gone 70+ years without any upgrades, probably almost any Starfleet ship could have won that fight.

I bet an *Oberth*\-class would still have been stuffed 😉

The *Intrepid*\-class uses Type X phaser arrays, the same as the *Galaxy*\-class. Per the *TNG Technical Manual* the type defines the maximum power output – in the case of Type X, 5.1MW per emitter segment. The \*Galaxy-\*class has hundreds of individual emitters in its largest arrays, whereas the largest emitter arrays on the *Intrepid*\-class saucer dorsal hull are a tenth that size. This means that while the individual shots from the *Galaxy*\-class and *Intrepid*\-class have the same power, the *Galaxy*\-class has more phaser emitters on its dorsal saucer array than the *Intrepid*\-class has in total. A *Galaxy*\-class letting rip with multiple emitters at once – as we see the *Enterprise*\-D do very occasionally to a limited degree – would have incredible firepower.

TL;DR – the *Intrepid* is effectively a pocket *Galaxy*\-class in terms of weapons firepower, scaled down to its much smaller size – and it does have double the photon torpedo launchers of a *Galaxy*\-class. *Intrepids* also have a much more capable power plant than a *Defiant*\-class (class 7 warp drive vs class 9).",hx4ctaj,t3_stdmrm,/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/stdmrm/a_defiantclass_ship_could_defeat_a_refitexcelsior/hx4ctaj/,11,DaystromInstitute,False,0,2022-02-16

ChewyYui,"&gt;	This book, the Player's Handbook, and the Monster Manual present the default assumptions for how the worlds of D&amp;D work. Among the established settings of D&amp;D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Mystara don't stray very far from those assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, Ravenloft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further away from that baseline. As you create your own world, it's up to you to decide where on the spectrum you want your world to fall.

&gt;Core Assumptions

&gt;The rules of the game are based on the following core assumptions about the game world.

&gt;Gods Oversee the World. The gods are real and embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, forests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world by granting divine magic to their followers and sending signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its rivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, none can deny their existence.

lunatickoala,"There's so many factors that go into how effective a warship is though that there's no way that a definitive comparison could be made without either knowing all the details of all relevant systems (which can't be done because that level of detail doesn't exist in canon) or unless someone comes right out and says it in canon.

And to be fair, it's a problem that exists even when comparing real world weapons. Armchair generals and admirals like to wage war by stat sheet when soft factors always play just as big a role as the hard numbers.

Does the Intrepid's more advanced sensor suite and computer system allow it to be more effective in combat than the raw numbers indicate? Its much higher speed requires a lot more power so can that power be redirected to the weapons and shields making it more powerful than a Galaxy? Or does its EPS grid limit the amount of power that it can distribute to the weapons and shields? Conversely, is the Galaxy more limited in that regard? When the Galaxy is firing from multiple segments, are those all at full power or does the power feed to the main battery limit overall output? Since Starfleet distrusts full automation, usability would be an important factor so which ship has the better tactical station? Incidentally, Defiant has two tactical stations which is one of those soft factors that makes a big difference because it allows for greater situational awareness and division of responsibilities as well as redundancy in case one of them explodes.

We don't have answers to any of those and any one of them could be the difference in which one is actually better in combat.

As for why we didn't see newer ships in the Dominion War, a lot of that could be doctrinal. When a fleet is positioning or maneuvering, its speed is constrained by its slowest ship. There weren't enough Intrepids (or Sovereigns) for a fast battle group so the best use would have been to send the Intrepids solo ahead of the fleet and make use of their speed and sensors as fast scouts, then to hightail it out of there without engaging since they wouldn't have had the numbers to fight it out.",hx5fig9,t3_stdmrm,/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/stdmrm/a_defiantclass_ship_could_defeat_a_refitexcelsior/hx5fig9/,9,DaystromInstitute,False,0,2022-02-16
Tasty-Fox9030,"They definitely think about it, witness the TR-116. However, if it made strategic sense for those things to be standard issue they would be- you can replicate a rifle easily enough.

My personal guess on the matter is that shields and warp fields are more similar than different, and most weapons in Star Trek have a space distorting effect that allows them to penetrate a shield. 

It's been said before that Warp Drive is not an Alcubierre drive. However. I'd argue that it's more similar than different- space is distorting around the ship. If you distort space around a ship such that there is no direct path from the weapon to the ship, it doesn't matter what amount of kinetic energy is put into the shot; it effectively misses. 

Replace that long rod penetrator with a field that distorts... Nay DISRUPTS the local topology of spacetime, and you could conceivably be battering down said shield and tunneling a path that will reach the target. 

It is pretty evident than infantry scale shields are not practical. They're not in use in scenarios that would effectively mandate them. However. It could be that infantry scale shields strong enough to resist a phaser or a disruptor against its spacetime distorting shenanigans are impractical, and ones that would block a conventional weapon are not.

If I'm not mistaken, there's an example of a ship with lasers threatening the Enterprise in TNG. I believe it's The Outrageous Okona. Riker's take on the matter is that the lasers ""wouldn't even make it past the Navigational Deflector"". That would itself be a specialized, and apparently less grossly powerful version of the shielding technology. 

With all that being said, projectile firing weapons would be trivially easy to shield and armor against. It would end up being an additional bulky thing to carry, that could be quickly replicated if someone was silly enough to try using bullets. They're also likely harder to add smart features to- it sort of beggars belief that things like a type 1 Phaser aren't using all kinds of smart sensors and targeting features that aren't immediately apparent to someone that isn't the wielder. 

As a little side bonus, if Phasers do indeed impart subspace weirdness onto their targets at certain settings, it would go a long way towards explaining why vaporizing people with them doesn't cause an explosion that kills everyone in the building. 

The only real downside I see here is that I'd actually still WANT the personal shield even if it won't stop a Phaser- most casualties are from shrapnel and given the energy of these things I would expect plenty of that flying around in a pitched battle. I'd also expect ""cover"" to be something of a nostalgic memory but that is another discussion altogether.  Honestly it could be that infantry combat is so much of a sideshow compared to fleet actions that very little is spent in the way of resources to think about that sort of equipment. It makes sense for the Dominion or Cardassians to have that sort of stuff given that they want to pacify captured territory but the Federation doesn't do that much at all at least until the war.",hx5aass,t3_stozj5,/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/stozj5/why_does_it_seem_everyone_sleeps_on_kinetic/hx5aass/,9,DaystromInstitute,False,0,2022-02-16
y_sengaku,"My answer will only cover down to around 1470 (1469/72) when the king of Denmark (together with Norway under the Kalmar Union) transferred Shetland and the Orkney Isles into the hand of the king of Scotland in exchange for some payment.  

The first certain turning point for medieval history of Shetland occurred in 1195: King Sverre of Norway (who had grew up himself in the Faroe Islands - see my previous post on: [How did the Faroe Islands get into the hands of the Kingdom of Denmark? Is it a colony or constituted as something else?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/qt2ssr/how_did_the_faroe_islands_get_into_the_hands_of/)) summoned and confiscated Shetland from the Earl Harald Maddadson of the Orkney due to his alleged involvement with the revolt of eyjarskeggjar (the Island-beard faction) after their defeat, and instead put the islands under the direct rule of the king of Norway. King Sverre appointed the local official (*syslemann*) to take care of the royal farmsteads as well as judicial process in Shetland (probably based on confiscated possession of the dead rebels as well as the Earl of Orkney). Archdeaconry (deputy of the bishop of Orkney) also seemed to be set up around 1200, but we don't know much about how the archdeacon worked on field in Shetland in the 13th century (Cf. Smith 2003). Instead, several (almost all) of their archdeacons served the king of Norway well (sometimes as a royal chaplain), and were often employed as the diplomatic envoy to England and Scotland.  

+++

There are at least a few local documents (in Old Norse) issued in Shetland around 1300, and we know the royal local official who was mentioned in these documents rather well than the majority of other Norwegian officials about the same time - his name is ""Sir (*herra*)"" Thorvald Thoresson ""of Shetland"" (middle of the 13th century - after 1330).  

He first appeared in 1289 as one of the diplomats of King Eirik Magnusson of Norway to King Edward I of England, called the knight (*miles*) as well as ""of Shetland (*de Shetland*)"" ([DN XIX-328](https://www.dokpro.uio.no/cgi-bin/middelalder/diplom_vise_tekst.cgi?b=16303&amp;s=e&amp;str=)). At that time, the title (Lord or Sir in modern English, *herra* in Old Norse) of the knight was the second rank of royal liegemen (*hirð* in Old Norse), serving aristocracy in medieval Norway. While researchers don't reach an agreement on his exact origin, but if we accept Crawford's claim (Crawford 1992: 73), he was a native Shetlander who played a role of mediator with the title of nobility between the king and the local society.  

Helle suggests that these preference of Shetlanders/ officials whose post was in Shetland in the diplomatic business of medieval Norwegian kings might be relevant not only to the location of Shetland itself, but also to their possible cultural/ linguistic knowledge of the British Isles (due to the location, of course) (Helle in Crawford ed. 2002: 47).  

The oldest extant local document of 1299 in Shetland tell us the vivid picture of a strife of the island society in which : On Mar 13 (Monday in the Passion week) and 14, 1299, a female called Ragnhildr (Símunardóttir= daughter of certain Símun) came to [a *stofa* (gathering building) (linked to the reconstruction site)](https://www.papastourhcg.org/norse-stofa) in Papa Stour, a small island located west to the main island of Shetland, and accuse Thorvald of cheating a part of the rent payment owed to Duke  Håkon Magnusson, who had been a younger brother of King Eirik of Norway and would become a king of Norway himself as Håkon (V) (d. 1319) soon, from farmstead in that island, in front of other local people gathered in the building. Consequently, local people of shetland investigated the case (the detailed payment from the Island), clarified the alleged innocence of Thorvald against the accusation, and submitted it to the duke in written form - The 1299 document itself is a testimony of this quarrel.  

The document cites the voice of the alleged whistleblower, Ragnhildr, in vivid second-person dialogue style (The modern English translation is taken from: Crawford ed. 2002: 10-11):  

&gt;* ""You must not be my Judas, though you be the duke's.""
&gt;* ""I did not heed (Lord) Eindriði the frenzied, when he ran from the east out of Norway and never knew welcome, but you all who knew have then betrayed the duke.""  

We unfortunately knew neither the social origin of this Ragnhild (generally assumed as a tenant farmer?) nor the exact consequence of the accusation. Thorvald apparently succeeded in defending his influential position within Shetland in about 30 years or more, but it is nevertheless worth noting that the local community in Shetland didn't neglect the accusation of otherwise unknown woman, Ragnhildr, against the royal official, Thorvald, and took heed to it at least formally.   

Another local document from 1307, issued by the authority of the law assembly of Shetland in Tingwall ([DN I-109](https://www.dokpro.uio.no/cgi-bin/middelalder/diplom_vise_tekst.cgi?b=110&amp;s=e&amp;str=)), narrates the process of unsettled payment of fine to Thorvald (as a local royal official *sysleman*) again by a certain woman called Mistress (*Húsfrú*) Bjorg of Cullivoe. She owed 24 marks of fine (it was quite an amount of money, but we don't know what kind of crime she had committed), and couldn't pay it on spot. Thorvald repeatedly gave a choice to her whether she renewed an agreement of due payment to him on behalf of the royal authority or the case should be settled in the local law assembly [of Shetland] - so she finally resorted to the assembly to relieve her property (exactly speaking, the rent from the attached farmstead in question) from attachment that Thorvald had seized. While local assembly (*logrettamenn*) did not accept her claim fully, they at least advised Thorvald to be more lenient to her: Thorvald had tried only to accept the payment in (good) hard currency, but the assembly told him to accept her payment also in butter (at least for the half of the debt), one of the most common form of rent in medieval Norway (and the Atlantic Isles as well).  

Thus, these two legal cases, both Thorvald and a certain local woman involved with, offer an indispensable glimpse of how local society of medieval Shetland worked within the kingdom of Norway (Norwegian Dominion) stretching across the North Atlantic, as well as the legal-social status of woman within it. Even Thorvald, the local representative of the royal authority, at least sometimes had to pay attention to another representative of government, the voice of local community [of farmers] in Shetland and to make a compromise with them. 

We can confirm that Thorvald had at least three or four children, two (or more) sons and two daughters, whose last-born was named Herdis. When Thorvald last appeared in the historical document in 1330 (probably in his 70s or even in 80s), he was mentioned as ""Lord of Papa [Stour] (*dominus de Papey*) - researchers suppose that Thorvald somehow got the former royal estates in Papa Stour, Shetland, that he had taken care of. Thorvald's youngest child and daughter Herdis, who married with the Norwegian aristocrat (probably more than once) in Norway, seemed to inherit this property in Shetland. Widowed and without her child, Herdis decided to donate her property in Shetland for the foundation of Cistercian monastery on her bed in 1363 (though her last request never realized, and her cousin succeeded the property) (Øye in Crawford ed. 2002: 89).  

+++  

Well, this is ""an almost"" end of the story of Thorvald Thoresen and three local women (including his daughter, Herdis), probably the most prominent historical figure from medieval Shetland.  

Some modern authors (since the late 18th century) have collected the folk tale of certain ""Lord Terwil/ Tirvil"", a tyrant resided in Papa Stour with many sons and did many thing as he pleased, without taking any heed to laws. Crawford wonders whether this oral tradition is based on the reputation of Thorvald in the local society of Shetland (Crawford 1992: 85f.) 

As for the modern re-telling of ""Lord Terwil"" and brief profile of Thorvald thoresen, you can also find it at the official site of the Viking festival of Shetland (Up Helly Aa): https://www.uphellyaa.org/recent-festivals/2018/saga-of-thorvald-thorvaldsson/

Frozendark23,"Hammerfell is much more technologically advanced than Skyrim and can be considered on par with the empire and the aldmeri dominion. Now look at Skyrim. With the exception of windhelm, markarth and solitude, the walls are quite bad. Most of the people hate magic and mages in general. People say that the environment are in the favour of the Nords but nearly every single thalmor soldier knows magic. Look at the embassy. Even foot soldiers know basic magic and how to summon bound weapons so basic destruction and conjuration magic.


The legates in Skyrim are mostly Nord along with most of the soldiers. Only tullius, one or two legates and a handful of soldiers are imperial and from cyrodiil. Also, why would Skyrim want to break off from the empire. Also the advantages of skyrim's environment could be used by the empire if they weren't kicked out. Imperial equipment is also superior. Compare the imperial equipment to stormcloak equipment. The best the stormcloaks have is cloth, a bear pelt and some metal. The imperials have full metal armour with a superior sword and shield than what the stormcloaks use. 

To top it off, to answer my previous question on why Skyrim wants to break off from the empire, it is simple. Ulfric wants to be high king. The freedom of religion he talks about during his speeches is not his primary objective. It is important but not his main objective. His main objective is being high king. If it wasn't, he would actually talk to torygg rather than immediately dueling him and killing him. He would understand that going along with the empire is better for the long run. Torygg is a good high king but to ulfric, he is someone that is in the way of him being high king. He also thinks the same about the empire, they are just in his way of being high king.",hx534il,t3_stbxof,/r/SkyrimMemes/comments/stbxof/it_really_isnt_so_complicated/hx534il/,8,SkyrimMemes,False,0,2022-02-16

George Washington said it best, “However \[political parties\] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.”

Slaxle,"So the best bomber I know on PS4 NA runs dagons dominion + dark convergence, although vicious death is good too. Alot of these aoe builds with dark convergence will centralize around using your colossus ultimate with balorghs helm for high weapon Penn. And will utilize Harmony jewlry. If the bomber style isn't for you there's other ways to go. I would not recommend rattleblcage, it's a cheap way to get major sorcery, and isn't that good of a set and will be even worse when the new patch comes out. Use degeneration from mages guild and if you don't have it yet use alliance major spell power potions that can be purchased with AP. 

Some will try to say being a bomber  or using  Harmony traits is the only option, this isnt true. You can pair spinners with vicious death or plaguebreak. I also know some VERY good magcros who do t bomb who use oblivion foe, which is nice for an extra strong DoT. Magcro takes alot of finesse to get down and master. Other recommended sets include clever alchemist and heartland conqueror. I currently run heartland on my Necro. 

No matter what you will probably want to run stage 3 vamp and I recommend either running malacaths or back barring a resto potentates for extra tankyness. The biggest issue you will have is resource management and sustain. 

I'm very new to magcro myself but two of my friends have very good necros

TheBeardedSingleMalt,"That's been my headcanon for some time.  Miranda and Excelsior, along with Oberth and Constellation, were well designed classes for their primary roles which also offered enough versatility that there was no reason not to continue using them.  After the Klingon cold war ended, and with the Romulans going into exile Starfleet got a little too complacent and lax with their starship design.  Sure they pumped out some new classes between ENT-B and ENT-D but those never truly stuck the landing as well; the most successful being Ambassador but even that didn't have the longevity.

Plus I've said that post Wolf-359 Starfleet started rapidly upgrading the fleet mothballing most of the in-service Miranda's and older Excelsiors with the new classes like Akira, Sabre, ect.  That rapid rollout worked in their advantage when the Dominion War hit because they had ships decommissioned less than 5 years prior they could slap some newer weapons on, upgrade the shields and throw together a skeleton crew...hence the large number of Miranda's and Excelsiors.",hx6q6gj,t3_stfl1j,/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/stfl1j/the_miranda_class_why_it_is_so_long_lived/hx6q6gj/,7,DaystromInstitute,False,0,2022-02-16

ObligateLycanthrope,"The only “tarded” people here are the ones who think that there is one ending to the Civil War that could see an Aldmeri Dominion invasion be defeated. I support the Empire every time I do the questline, and believe that unifying the provinces of men is the best way to prevent the Dominion from taking over the continent, but I also acknowledge that the alternative is viable.

The Imperials only fought the Dominion to a truce, and that was with the backing of the Nords and Redguards. If the Dominion were to attack Skyrim, they would either have to provoke neighboring provinces by moving troops through them and then fight in the mountain passes, or they’d have to navigate the Sea of Ghosts and get past the coastline. You said that Hammerfell only won against the Dominion because of the hostility of their home turf? Skyrim is much the same, and the Nords are well adapted to it. This is all, of course, if we ignore the potential intervention of the Dragonborn.

Ignore all of that, though. It’s a singleplayer RPG for goodness sake. There’s no “right” way to play it and certainly no reason to call someone developmentally challenged over their side in the politics of a fantasy world.",hx86mgu,t3_su2r14,/r/SkyrimMemes/comments/su2r14/general_tullius_executes_pows_without_trial_and/hx86mgu/,7,SkyrimMemes,False,0,2022-02-16

Ultimately no matter how much these arguments try to centre compassion, they always seem to draw the same conclusion: that we should continue to needlessly slaughter animals in some form. This is not really related to veganism. The lines we draw are categorically not arbitrary. 

You’re young, so I can understand your lack of knowledge on this subject. Suggest you take to youtube and watch the documentaries Dominion and Earthlings.

*The Chimes of Midnight* is masterpiece, but would make more sense if you listen to Charley/Eighth's background stories. 

*Spare Parts*, *Creatures of Beauty*, *The Kingmaker*, *The Holy Terror*, *Doctor Who and the Pirates*, *Jubilee*, *The Genocide Machine*, *Loups Garoux*, *The Fear Monger* are really good. 

*UNIT: Dominion* is also really good. It's audio epic done right. Highly recommended to listen to *Colditz* first. A bit recommended to listen to Seventh Doctor's Lost Stories (*Crime of the Century, Thin Ice, Animal, Earth Aid*), but it's quite a meh stories. 

*Foe from The Future, Paradise 5, Leviathan, Farewell Great Macedon, The Elite* are the best imo from Lost Stories boxset.

PopGoesTheBuizel,"The majority of these pitfalls are localised to the puppet jarldom of Haafingar and not the immediate responsibility of the Empire itself, sure, but the point here is to illustrate what a tired old argument the Gray Quarter/Argonian Assemblage fallacy is by comparison. The Empire escapes far too much criticism for very real crimes against their neighbours, nowhere can the lifecycle of their ""friendship"" be better seen than in their occupation of Morrowind in the Third Era; they stagnated the nation's economy for centuries, plundering its natural resources and getting rich off the enslavement of men and mer alike, heck even their own citizens (see Manilian Scerius) before abandoning their liaisons in House Hlaalu and the Dunmer people as a whole to their fates during the Oblivion Crisis to save their own hide. Instead, Ulfric who doesn't have a single prejudiced line of dialogue is smeared as a racist for prioritising an active war effort over the standard of living of those with every reason to take up arms against the Empire but whose neutrality he respects all the same.

Yes Ulfric has ambitions for High King of Skyrim but why in Shor's name not? The man's been to Oblivion and back for Skyrim and her people. He inspires the hearts and minds of his supporters because he represents a generation of Nords who laid down their lives for an Emperor who not moments after they retook the Imperial City, spat in the face of the very death-or-glory heroism which turned the tide of the war and surrendered to the Dominion, throwing Skyrim and Hammerfell to the wolves to once again save his own skin. No one's under any illusion Ulfric's a saint, but as Dengier says; he's ""the devil [we] know"", he's the Ysgramor to unify Skyrim and lead her out of this age of oppression under an Empire-sanctioned hostile foreign power dragging people away into the night for practicing freedom of worship. The Empire's a lame horse, it's infected with Thalmor spies at every level of government like maggots in a wound. If Skyrim's going to have a hope at repelling the Dominion a second time, it has to focus on its own interests and Ulfric's the one to lead us.",hx5tw5c,t3_sthc1o,/r/SkyrimMemes/comments/sthc1o/o_haafingar_the_gem_of_the_ocean/hx5tw5c/,6,SkyrimMemes,True,0,2022-02-16
