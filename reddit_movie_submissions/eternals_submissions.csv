Trailer...all visuals no substance...?,"The trailer is visually very good but I'm having my doubts about a movie based on group of superheroes that the average Joe/Jane likely has no clue about or even ever heard about.

Most non comic readers have at least  heard of Thor but how many can actually name an eternal? I would wager that the non serious comic reader would have trouble naming more then 1 or 2 of the eternals or be even able to explain at least partially their back story.

"Can some ppl stop with the whole ""where were the eternals during infinity war and endgame"" thing",I get that a lot of these are jokes and memes but I've seen comments where ppl are legit annoyed and are saying how dumb this is. Well how about we wait to watch the movie and then see for ourselves why they didn't interfere all these years. Maybe they all didn't even remember who they are or there's a very logical and serious reason why they weren't allowed to interfere like how about we just chill and wait for the movie. Maybe they didn't want to reveal themselves because some other villain out in the universe will come for them. Maybe they did reveal themselves once thousands of years ago and it went horribly so they decided never to do it again. We literally know nothing about them and most ppl haven't read their comics. Again I have no problem with the jokes and memes but some ppl are literally complaining that the idea of these superpowered beings living on earth all this time is dumb and doesn't make sense and the trailer was to vague and empty and didn't give anything away. As if that isn't the point of the trailers like who wants to know what they were doing all this time and explain their absence in a trailer and then these same ppl will complain that the trailers spoils too much.,marvelstudios,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nkzoek/can_some_ppl_stop_with_the_whole_where_were_the/,Discussion,wegotworktodo,nkzoek,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nkzoek/can_some_ppl_stop_with_the_whole_where_were_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nkzoek/can_some_ppl_stop_with_the_whole_where_were_the/,11,2021-05-25

Black knight doesn't fit?,"Hi!
I'm really looking forward to the eternals movie as they are introducing both new characters that I don't know much about and the more cosmic side of MCU.

But, after reading up a bit, I still don't understand how the black knight fits into all of this?
I mean the eternals are cosmic along with the celestials.
What the heck does a dude with a cursed magic sword has anything to do with them?

As a solo movie or story I would get it, but not in a cosmic movie.
He really stands out in my eyes.
I don't get it..

Salma Hayek Lost Two Comedy Roles Because Directors Feared Mexican Lead Would Upset Studio,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/05/salma-hayek-lost-comedy-roles-studios-racism-mexican-1234639057/) reduced by 51%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Salma Hayek revealed in a new Variety cover story that two directors informed her she wasn&amp;#039;t getting a job on their movies solely because she is a Mexican actress, despite both filmmakers admitting she was the best actress for those roles.

&gt; Hayek got her Hollywood breakthrough by starring opposite Antonio Banderas in Robert Rodriguez&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Desperado.&amp;quot; But even then the studio did not want to hire a Mexican actress.

&gt; As Hayek revealed in an interview with Elle magazine last year, &amp;quot;I remember Cameron Diaz was huge at the time and her last name was Diaz, so they said she can be Mexican. She was part of the list, and I had to audition againI&amp;#039;m telling you, the studio wanted Cameron Diaz as a Mexican.""

&gt; &amp;quot;I begged for an audition. They wouldn&amp;#039;t even give me an audition,&amp;quot; Hayek told Elle.

&gt; &amp;quot;I was like, &amp;#039;Just hear me read.&amp;#039; And this is for a Latino role. They were not hiring Latinos for Latino roles. They were not hiring Latinos period - unless it was the maid or the prostitute. And that part was not a maid or a prostitute.""

&gt; Next up for Hayek are two studio tentpoles, &amp;quot;The Hitman&amp;#039;s Bodyguard&amp;#039;s Wife&amp;quot; and the MCU epic &amp;quot;Eternals.&amp;quot; Head over to Variety to read Hayek&amp;#039;s new cover story in its entirety.

How good could Marvel Phase 4 be for the movies.,"**Black Widow:** I think this movie be great. I see a lot of hype for this movie. Estimated Grossing: 1 billion

&amp;#x200B;

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: This movie has a lot of hype I think this movie would do great. Estimated Grossing: 1 billion

&amp;#x200B;

Thor: Love and Thunder: This movie doesn't have too much hype, but it's not off the radar. I feel like this movie would be like Thor 3. Estimated Grossing: 750-800 million

&amp;#x200B;

Eternals: I don't think it be great. Their's no hype, movie doesn't have popular characters, and less popular characters tend to make worse movies Antman's 2 movies aren't bad, but not great, same with Captain Marvel. I think Kumail is perfect as Kingo. I seen some people say is Kumail the right choice. Estimated Grossing: 500-600 million

&amp;#x200B;

Shang-Chi: No hype at all, not popular characters, seems separated from other things. Estimated Grossing: 400-500 million

&amp;#x200B;

Spider-Man: No Way Home: Come one this movie's gonna be great. Estimated Grossing: 1 billion-2 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

Black Panther 2: This movie gonna be great. I think Marvel will try to make this in the memory to Chadwick and they gonna try hard.  Estimated Grossing: 800-900 million

&amp;#x200B;

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania: This movie will be great. I think this will be the best Antman movie I haven't been a big fan of Antman movies, but I am hyped for this one. Estimated Grossing 700-800 Million.

&amp;#x200B;

Captain Marvel 2: I think I will hate this movie. I think Captain Marvel was horrible. I personally think the face of the MCU should be Spiderman or Wanda. Estimated Grossing: 1 billion.

"Does The Eternals actually look good to most people? Not shit-posting here, I'm genuinely concerned.","I've watched the trailers and read discussions, but I don't understand why people are excited for this movie. I loved Wandavision, enjoyed the heck out of Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and I'm excited for both Black Widow and Loki. Shang-Chi looks interesting, being a genre that Marvel hasn't tackled yet, but Eternals just looks...bland? I don't really know what it is about it.

This to me just looks like the Inhumans, take two. A group of people who have been around watching humanity behind the shadows, with super powered abilities, are sent to what looks like Hawaii, while all having a bland, bored expression on their faces like their better than everyone else. Plus they even have an actor from Game of Thrones! Lets just drop an Avengers nod out of nowhere, that'll make us cool. There is just way to many characters with individual quirks to be given enough screen time to develop properly. 

Hell, I think the first Guardians barely worked with 5 people, and one their entire characters arch is saying an additional 2 words from the 3 he said on repeat.

I hope I'm wrong, but it only feels like people are only excited because it is another Marvel property coming off a years drought with nothing.",marvelstudios,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nknymj/does_the_eternals_actually_look_good_to_most/,Question,JcFerggy,nknymj,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nknymj/does_the_eternals_actually_look_good_to_most/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nknymj/does_the_eternals_actually_look_good_to_most/,30,2021-05-25
Diversity in the MCU,"I think we can all agree that one of the main themes of Phase 4 is diversity. Racial identity and the implications of it are something that is being brought up in Marvel Studios' films and TV shows, and I for one think it's an important thing to do. Most of their projects this year are really delving deep into characters from other cultures and ethnic backgrounds, and not just showing white men in spandex pulling off god-level feats. The Falcon and The Winter Solder is a prime example of this. Sam being a black Captain America and why it matters so much is well explored within the show, by dealing with topics such as systemic racism. Most studios wouldn't think about tackling such a sensitive topic, but Marvel did it and they did it well. I think the upcoming Ms. Marvel series might deal with some sensitive issues related to immigration and/or Islamophobia, but I'll hold my horses on that one.

Marvel is also exploring new worlds and different cultures in their upcoming movies, Shang-Chi and Eternals. Shang-Chi is gonna focus on the ancient Chinese mythos and the culture surrounding it, while the Eternals seems to explore a broader spectrum of cultures and civilizations throughout time.

Apart from all that, Marvel is also introducing a gay and a deaf character in the Eternals, and although it's nothing we haven't seen before, representation wherever possible does matter. Also seeing so many women being the lead role in their projects is a big plus for me.

All in all, I just wanted to give my 2 cents on diversity and representation of different cultures, races, sexes and ethnicities and why it matters. I think Marvel Studios is doing a good job and I'm more excited than ever before to watch their movies and TV shows.",marvelstudios,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nkfjc1/diversity_in_the_mcu/,Other,crimson_is_red,nkfjc1,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nkfjc1/diversity_in_the_mcu/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nkfjc1/diversity_in_the_mcu/,72,2021-05-25
Eternals theory,"Eternals theory

I think that the Celestials are going to wipe the minds of the Eternals during the Third Host and replace them with Inhumans.

Furthermore, I don’t think the humans will the result of Celestial experimentation in the MCU but rather will be experimented on to create both Deviants and Eternals. 

Lastly I think admixture between Deviants and humans will result in the early mutant race (although I don’t think that will actually be explored in the movie).",MCUTheories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/nkwid9/eternals_theory/,Theory,Objective_Bottle_941,nkwid9,/r/MCUTheories/comments/nkwid9/eternals_theory/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/nkwid9/eternals_theory/,4,2021-05-25

Marvels “ETERNALS” could be social conditioning for a coming reveal of Alien Life / Our Origins,"Okay, so I’ve been on a deep dive into a lot of things involving conspiracies around CERN and the end of the world, The Nostradamus Prophecies, and the UFO intel about to be made public (hopefully). 

To cut to the chase, if you’re familiar with social conditioning you’d understand how TV and media influences how we act/react to or with certain things or behaviors people exhibit. Do you think with all the craze around aliens and UFO’s here lately, they are maybe trying to lighten the effect a physical presence of aliens would have on us?

HC: So why didn't you help us?

Sersi: Because thats not why we were put here

HC: But with the power you have. Yo- you could have saved us all

Sersi: I know it sounds wrong but we had to watch from beyond. The power we have is greater than any who have stepped on the Terra Firma of the universe

HC: I don't...I don't understand. Isn't that the reason you SHOULD have been here

Sersi: Its the opposite. The Eternals were founded with the goal of aiding humanity towards its greater destiny. If we were to intervene, it would destroy this goal. There is no point in raising humans if not to let them stand on their own

Eternals trailer,"So I could be totally wrong, but when I saw the ship in the trailer I thought what if that ship is *THE* Ship! The one that Apocalypse uses, created by the celestials? Marvel could do a unique take on it. Just a neat idea, could tie into The Mutants. Maybe tease En Sabah Nur in the movie, he could retrieve his celestial armor in the ship?

Why all the hate for Eternals?,"I don't understand why people are so enraged by a movie that has just been teased won't be released for months.

Other then the teaser what other bits of news have I missed that point towards this movie being an eternal blunder? 

The most hated argument I hear is regarding the statement that the Eternals have been on earth for thousands of years and in all that time didn't participate in actual threats to the planet like the alien invasions, robot revolutions or when the fate of the universe was literally at stake.

I am bothered by that as well but I have faith the writers will come up with a plausible explanation.",marvelstudios,3,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nll9xi/why_all_the_hate_for_eternals/,'Eternals' Spoilers,VladtheImpaler21,nll9xi,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nll9xi/why_all_the_hate_for_eternals/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nll9xi/why_all_the_hate_for_eternals/,72,2021-05-26

Eternals absence explanation. (THEORY),"After seeing so many people question why the Eeernals didn't show up for Infinity War/Endgame, I think I've come up with a pretty simple theory. For nearly the entire run time of Infinity War, the general public had no idea what was going on until the Snap, and even then they didn't have an explanation. Five years later, again no one knew the events of Endgame were occurring until half the Universe returned. If we take these facts into account, and statement in the released synopsis which states the Eternals will be reuniting, it's safe to say they weren't in contact with each other for some time and weren't active as superheroes for a while.  I think it's safe to say they were just as clueless as the rest of the population until it was too late. It may seem kinda obvious, but I was just a lil annoyed with the ""Lol where were these guys duing Infinity War?

How will we get the last 2 Eternals?,"So we've had the Eternals wave leaked for a very long time now, but there's only 7 figures plus a BAF and the deluxe of the villain. That leaves 2 of our main Eternals, Thena and Ajak, as well as Dane Whitman/Black Knight. Considering these 3 characters will presumably be fairly significant, what with them being played by big-name actors and all, how do you think these characters' figures will get released? A second wave? Three pack? Deluxe/Riders? Exclusives?",MarvelLegends,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelLegends/comments/nl51s0/how_will_we_get_the_last_2_eternals/,Discussion,AmphedUp6214,nl51s0,/r/MarvelLegends/comments/nl51s0/how_will_we_get_the_last_2_eternals/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelLegends/comments/nl51s0/how_will_we_get_the_last_2_eternals/,8,2021-05-26
"AoSLore Book Club: Why should you read ""Hamilcar: Champion of the Gods""?","Greetings and good tidings once more fellow Gate Seekers. It seems that the poll to pick our next slew of entries into our Bi-Weekly has met with roaring success, with the forerunner being Hamilcar: Champion of the Gods.   


Now before getting into my thoughts on why you should read this book. I want to ask those of you who have read it. Without going into spoilers, would you recommend this book? Did you enjoy Hamilcar's first full length adventure? What are your opinions? How would you review you? Did you dislike it? Feel free to comment down below.  


As for me. I am biased, because this is by far my favorite novel in Age of Sigmar. And why? Because in my opinon Hamilcar is one of the most entertaining Stormcast Eternals to ever be chosen by Sigmar. I would fully recommend this book solely based on the quality of Hamilcar, because this big, boisterous cave man taken by Sigmar from the snowy wildernesses of Azyr is the perfect epitome of a Barbarian Hero in the vein of Baldur's Gate's Minsc, He-Man, and all the other strange and frankly whimsical barbarian heroes in fiction who are nonetheless effective at what they do. Plus. He'll glad tell you about all the times his ass has been kicked, even in the midst of bragging.

Advice for Gisa and Geralf (UB Zombie Tribal),"Hey everyone! I thought I'd share the first edh-deck I've built from scratch as part of a random commander challenge from my pod. I drew \[\[Gisa and Geralf\]\] and decided to go Zombie tribal with a big dollop of recursion and (self-)milling. As far as I know, the opponents will be using \[\[Liesa\]\], \[\[Edric\]\], and \[\[Dalakos\]\].

According to agreed-upon budget restrictions, the total cost of the deck is less than €35,00 with no cards over €2,00. The commander costs less than €5,00 and basic lands aren't included. Since we all live in Germany, we've refereced prices set by [miraclegames.de](https://miraclegames.de) 

The main strategy is to mill Zombies into the graveyard and bring them back to hand or into play. They're not a very aggressive bunch but with enough buffing and token-reinforcement, they should manage to take out the other players one by one. Main payoffs include:

Self-milling: Gisa and Geralf; \[\[Mire Triton\]\], \[\[Corpse Churn\]\], \[\[Port of Karfell\]\]

Zombie Buffers: \[\[Diregraf Captain\]\], \[\[Eternal Skylord\]\], \[\[Gleaming Overseer\]\], \[\[Liliana's Mastery\]\]

Zombie Tokens / Amass: \[\[Tormod, the Desecrator\]\], \[\[From under the floorboards\]\], \[\[Necromancer's Stockpile\]\], \[\[Lazotep Reaver\]\] + other Eternals

Possible Wincons: \[\[Undead Alchemist\]\], \[\[Syr Konrad\]\], \[\[Necromantic Selection\]\]

Protection from Graveyard hate: \[\[Cranial Archive\]\], \[\[Perpetual Timepiece\]\]

Any constructive advice for how to optimize the deck would be greatly appreciated. The Maybeboard already has many cards from my collection that fit the budget and replace others. 

Thanks!

A few possible ways that Eternals might tie into existing Marvel franchises and set up others!,"So given that Eternals spans thousands of years and visits locations all over the globe, I spent some time thinking about how the group could fit into the broader MCU world. So, here are some of my ideas of how Eternals will be tied into other Marvel properties!

1. Atlantis/Namor

Since the movie seems to be explaining the origins of human mythology using the Eternals, Atlantis would be a perfect. Perhaps the Eternals were there to witness it sinking into the ocean (or even helped cause it accidentally)

2. Wakanda/Black Panther

With Sersi helping humans grow plants and Phastos helping them with technology, maybe the Eternals helped early Wakandans discover both vibranium and the heart-shaped herb

3. En Sabbah Nur (Apocalypse)/Rama Tut (Kang)

We see the Eternals with some artifacts from Egypt, so perhaps we'll see them cross paths with both these characters in Ancient Egypt. With Kang and the X-Men soon to be big presences in the MCU, this would be the most opportune and organic way to introduce these versions of the characters

4. Shang-Chi

In the Shang-Chi trailer we see some footage of a battle featuring mythological creatures. Given the Eternals' seeming influence on mythology around the world, maybe we'll see what kind of impact they had on China it's mythology

5. Otherworld 

We see some shots of a Medieval setting and Black Knight will be in the film, who has ties to Arthurian Legend. Perhaps we'll get some references to Otherworld to pave the way for Captain Britain, Excalibur, etc. joining the MCU down the line

6. Olympus/Hercules

With Zeus and (presumably) Hercules set to be introduced in Thor, maybe we'll see the Eternals cross paths with (or even create?) the Greek pantheon in some capacity

And I'm sure there are more that I'm not thinking of! Would love to hear your guys' ideas. The more I think about it, the more excited I get about how Eternals could be woven into all these other corners of the MCU!",marvelstudios,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nl4v1u/a_few_possible_ways_that_eternals_might_tie_into/,Theory,Azalea169,nl4v1u,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nl4v1u/a_few_possible_ways_that_eternals_might_tie_into/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nl4v1u/a_few_possible_ways_that_eternals_might_tie_into/,8,2021-05-26

# SSR Character Discussion: Seox

## Journal Entry

*One of the Eternals—they who stand astride the skies and across the path of any would-be calamity. Seox's power is unrivaled, for he bears the mark of destiny. His emotional instability is just part of his mask—his love is hidden deeper. He seeks to reach beyond the sky, where the one he holds dear travels.*

It looks like the “They’re Coming” cards are fortnite related. So is it possible
they are trying to ease the public in for a full disclosure by testing the waters?

"Eternals Theory for ""We have never interfered until now"" quote","So we're all wondering why the Eternals never interfered, right? This includes Sokovia, invasion from Avengers 1, and the Snap.

&amp;#x200B;

All previous conflicts are relatively small in the context of the universe but the Snap is obviously massive. We're assuming the ""we have never interfered until now"" is from a post-Snap conversation, but the teaser shows images of the Eternals in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

Why Eternals would interfere now??,"Many MCU fans have been trolling about what could be bigger than the snap that Eternals would interfere now and not when Thanos came.
I think it would be sort of a fight or debate between the Eternals that would escalate and force them to question thier actions up till this point. Sort of like Wakanda which had been in hinding for centuries until Killmonger, after which Wakandans chaged thier centuries old custom and revealed themselves to the world.

[Marvel Cinematic Universe] Ego the Living Planet and Knowhere are the same Celestial,"As established in the MCU, Celestials are an ancient race of extremely powerful and massive beings that are basically composed of pure energy. So in order for them to actually have a proper physical form, they have to contain that energy (aka themselves) within some form of ""armor"". 

We've seen almost every Celestial in the MCU have this ""armor"". For example, the celestial that wiped out a planet with the power stone, all the celestials that were shown in promotional art for *Eternals,* and the celestial that is the subject of this theory, ""Knowhere"".

Knowhere isn't the actual name of the Celestial, it's the name of the Celestial's decapitated head. But for simplicity's sake, I'll call the actual celestial Knowhere.

Now there is one celestial that is an odd one out. It doesn't have the same armor as the rest. In fact, it's true form is not even humanoid. Rather it takes the appearance of a planet. I'm talking about Ego of course. Why is he so different?

Lets take it back to the beginning. Ego says he started out as nothing but a **brain** floating in space. Afterward he slowly started creating shells upon shells around the brain using his celestial energy until he became big enough to get his own orbit and effectively turned into a planet. And then eventually he was able to use his celestial energy to do different kinds of shit like make extensions and avatars of himself and what not.

Well some of you can probably tell where I'm going with this. There was once a Celestial. A regular one that had armor, like all the rest. He was decapitated. We know he had armor because his decapitated head looks like a helmet. His head began floating in space. But... his brains, his core, his life essence pretty much, survive. It leaked out of his decapitated head and started floating in space too. And from there we get Ego. It's easy to assume Ego lost all his memories because of this.

Now one question you may have is... if celestials are composed of pure energy, why do they have a brain? Well, perhaps they aren't composed of pure energy entirely, and they have a brain that is their core. We know that Ego had a brain at his core despite being a celestial (Groot blows it up later in the movie). Its not too hard to imagine that behind all that armor, every celestial has one too.

I know this perhaps contradicts some comic lore but like I don't care, this is not the comics, this is the MCU.",FanTheories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/nlz4wh/marvel_cinematic_universe_ego_the_living_planet/,Marvel/DC,Doomeranged,nlz4wh,/r/FanTheories/comments/nlz4wh/marvel_cinematic_universe_ego_the_living_planet/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/nlz4wh/marvel_cinematic_universe_ego_the_living_planet/,66,2021-05-27

Why Eternals Didn't Interfere Theory,"Not sure if its been said yet, but, In the comics there is a storyline of them losing their memory, which I think someone may have done that to them pre-snap... (MEPHISTO??) jk... but that could explain why they didn't interfere. I think half of them got blipped... potentially that means the ones that came back when Hulk snapped may have regained their memories of who they truly are, and what there mission is.",MCUTheories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/nma6c4/why_eternals_didnt_interfere_theory/,,Wolffboi,nma6c4,/r/MCUTheories/comments/nma6c4/why_eternals_didnt_interfere_theory/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/nma6c4/why_eternals_didnt_interfere_theory/,1,2021-05-27

Marvel's 'The Eternals' looks dumb,"The trailer was lackluster at best. I don't care at all about any of them. I'm not even remotely interested in who they are or what their deal is. Especially if they were too busy *""not interfering""* when the world has almost ended multiple multiple times over the course of the MCU.

The sad thing is I like most of the actors in it. I think the GoT ppl are great. Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek is a badass. The trailer was just *meh...*

I HOPE I'm wrong.

P.S. My favorite MCU movie is probably Guardians of the Galaxy 1.",unpopularopinion,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nmajer/marvels_the_eternals_looks_dumb/,,Mastro-,nmajer,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nmajer/marvels_the_eternals_looks_dumb/,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nmajer/marvels_the_eternals_looks_dumb/,13,2021-05-27
No Way Home… at all.,"
Eternals aims to reshape the way we view the MCU. Like Infinity War, Eternals could end with a similar end of the world scenario, or at least a time frame for when that will soon happen.


So what does that mean for SMNWH? Well after Infinity War, Ant Man and the Wasp, which took place just before the snap, seeded the key to Endgames success. Scott hiding in the Quantum Realm. 


What if SMNWH ends just before the return of the celestials in Eternals, and Spider-Man gets ripped away by Dr. Strange to another universe just as the one we know receives its final judgment. Paralleling the presumed first scene of NWH which will likely be Peters own judgment in the murder of Mysterio. Potentially giving the MCU an opportunity to clean the slate of this first universe and restart the continuity in an adjacent universe. Obviously the consequences of leaving behind the main MCU timeline will be a huge part of the next string of films like Multiverse of Madness where Dr. Strange may be attempting to form a multiversal Avengers Team to save the sacred timeline from the celestials.

Xmen movie might also have to face the same hurdle . Same questions will be raised. And,similar explanation may seem repititive .

## Journal Entry

*This giant seeks battle with worthy opponents, fighting until there is a clear champion. As victor, he boasts of his powers; as vanquished, he compliments his adversary. He never voices resentment at the end of a fight, only lets out a hearty laugh. His greatest joy in life is the blood and sweat that falls in a contest of strength.*

"For The Eternals, Marvel should have taken more of a risk and cast relative unknowns like it did with other films rather than going with such big names.","Part of the appeal of many of Marvel's prior movies was that it gave lesser known actors (or actors primarily known for their supporting roles) the chance to shine in leading roles. Sarah Halley Finn did a genius job and deserves so much credit. But with The Eternals, so many of the actors are already well established to the point that while I like all of them individually, I worry that they might not mesh well as an ensemble or worse, that my impressions of them from past roles and films will take away from the appeal of the overall film.",unpopularopinion,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nm4x4t/for_the_eternals_marvel_should_have_taken_more_of/,,aandwandsy,nm4x4t,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nm4x4t/for_the_eternals_marvel_should_have_taken_more_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/nm4x4t/for_the_eternals_marvel_should_have_taken_more_of/,12,2021-05-27

Role of the Eternals in the MCU,"So I’m just gonna ask this from a storyline perspective: what is the purpose of the Eternals in the MCU? When all the big events happened and the avengers needed assistance, they were nowhere to be found. Now they want to get involved?

Has civ subtly trained you to identify wonders you've never thought about in real life?,"I was watching the trailer for Marvel's Eternals and in one but they pan over a city while they say ""we watched them build wonders"". I saw it and thought huh that looks like the hanging gardens.

Later, I saw an analysis video that said it was the hanging gardens in Babylon!

Nomadland killed my excitement for Eternals.,Okay so I turned on Nomadland and I thought the film was incredibly boring and uninteresting. I'm sorry I don't find a 60 year old woman wondering the earth compelling or interesting. Everyone was hyping Chloe Zhou up as this master storyteller when she only has 3 movies. I tried Nomadland and I'm sorry It was boring it killed any hype of that Eternals movie I will say thank God She actually shot on location and didn't use green screen.

Will a Disney-produced movie win every weekend of this year's holiday season?,"November 5-7: Eternals has the weekend to itself

November 12-14: Ghostbusters: Afterlife opens on the 11th for some reason, and the last film opened at #2 with $46 million. Eternals will probably top it.

November 19-21: Top Gun: Maverick opens, I see this performing like Blade Runner 2049. Does anyone who's not a 40 year old man or older actually care about this film? I don't see this attracting younger audiences at all, Blade Runner 2049 at least had the sci-fi element.

November 26-28: Encanto and Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City both open on the 24th, Encanto will easily take this weekend.

December 3-5: Encanto will likely stay at number 1, unless Nightmare Alley really breaks out. That's a Searchlight picture, so it would still go to Disney.

December 10-12: West Side Story opens, and will almost certainly be number 1 (20th Century/Disney).

December 17-19: Spider-Man: No Way Home opens, and will easily be number 1, and likely the biggest opening of the year. The film is distributed by Sony, but Disney paid for 25% of the film, and will receive 25% of the grosses, plus it's produced under their subsidiary.

December 24-26: A bunch of movies open on the 22nd, including 20th Century's The King's Man, although Spider-Man: No Way Home will likely win the weekend again.

December 31-January 2: No movies currently scheduled, Spider-Man will likely take this weekend as well, unless The Matrix 4 or Sing 2 hold really strong.

"Theory: Why Eternals Didn't Interfere Till now (Time Travel?, Infinity Stone Destruction???)","Hi, My theories why Eternals didn't interfere till now (Please note that I haven't read the comics much 🙈) Just putting these speculations here 🙊 

Theory 1
What if one of the responsibilities of Eternals is to maintain the 'natural order of things'. And everything was going on as per the natural flow (Be it constructive or destructive), until Avengers disturbed the flow of spacetime.

when Avengers travelled back in time, they interfered with timelines and it has disturbed the flow of Multiverse, the possible reason forcing Eternals to interfere now.

Theory 2 (Most Probable)
In Infinity War, Wong explains that infinity stones control 'essential' aspects of existence and are there since Big Bang, ln Endgame Ancient one also explains that removing on infinity stone would have catastrophic impact on their timeline. But now as Thanos destroyed these stones in Original MCU timeline, Eternals have to interfere now.",MarvelTheories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelTheories/comments/nn5pjo/theory_why_eternals_didnt_interfere_till_now_time/,,No_Discipline1403,nn5pjo,/r/MarvelTheories/comments/nn5pjo/theory_why_eternals_didnt_interfere_till_now_time/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelTheories/comments/nn5pjo/theory_why_eternals_didnt_interfere_till_now_time/,11,2021-05-28

As a person who’s not versed on the Eternals history. Can someone explain what the conflict or who the villain might be in this film?,"To my knowledge, the group is either invulnerable, has regenerative capability, or has immortality. Outside looking in, (sorry to bring DC into this but) this looks like the issue of any Superman video game. how can a credible physical conflict be created to affect a being/group that’s pretty much immortal, while maintaining a sense of consequence from choice and actions?

Who in the Marvel universe or storylines have they faced in their comic lore that can give a movie a worthwhile suspense that something might go wrong given the known abilities of the group.

Confirmed and Possible Time Periods of the Eternals Film,"It has been confirmed that Eternals will stretch over thousands of years of human history, so I decided to list them all.

*PREHISTORY**

The Beach People (from the teaser) - ~10,000 BC? (based on the primitive outfits and basic settlements)

Sersi helping humans agriculture (0:48 from the teaser) - 9,000-8,000 BC? (the time when humans develop agriculture in our universe)

Ikaris-Sersi montage (1:23 in the teaser) - looks to be the same scene as before

**ANCIENT HISTORY**

Babylon (from Marvel Celebrates as well as the teaser) - 575 BC-sometime after 1 AD? (the time frame for both the Ishtar Gate and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon coexisting)

**MEDIEVAL HISTORY**

Some knights in a forest - unknown time period (we might learn more, but this looks to be the same scene where Thena flashes her sword in a fight with Gilgamesh)

**MODERN PERIOD**

Makkari saving the girl - 16th century (looks to be Mesoamerican conquests, based on the girl's attire as well as the architecture and the pyramid like structure)

The ""main"" plot - sometime after October 2023 (as confirmed by the plot synopsis)

**UNKNOWN**

Thena next to the curtains (0:57 in the teaser) (judging by the ""onion dome"", this is sometime during or after the medieval period)

Sprite in a volcanic landscape / the volcano? (1:14 in the teaser) (we need more information, but this is certainly *not* Vesuvius, since it looks different in Loki)

Uni-Mind (1:22 in the teaser)

[MCU] A possible cameo in Eternals.,"Virako is an Eternal in the comics who would become the father of Ikaris (portrayed by Richard Madden in the film). Now, I think he might get a cameo or reference in the film. Why is this?

In the teaser, we see Makkari (Lauren Ridloff) saving a girl using her super speed. Upon close inspection, the symbols on the pillar look Mesoamerican, and the city looks very similar to somewhere like Tenochtitlan or Cusco. Along with knights raiding the city, this makes me think we will get a flashback to the collapse of either the Aztecs or the Inca.

Now, why did I mention Virako at the start?

During the late medieval period in the comics, Virako, along with a bunch of other Eternals including his brother Valkin, as well as Ajak (Salma Hayek) and Druig (Barry Keoghan), pay a visit to the cultures of pre-Columbian America, in particular the Aztecs, Inca, and Maya. Virako is associated with the gods Kukulcan and Quetzalcoatl.

FUCK OFF with the FAKE queer representation shit,"I'm so tired of these major studios exploiting queer audiences and manipulating the press with overblown claims of ""REPRESENTATION!"". Meanwhile, as a queer person, I notice their ""bold"", ""brave"", ""inclusive"" castings and characters are really anything but. It's some joke of a fucking punchline, it's some inconsequential glorified extra or walk-on, it's someone pointedly average and NOT anywhere near being prominent. Like, don't even bother dramatically announcing shit like that to me- it is a slap in the fucking face. Especially considering the fact that queer people MAKE the entertainment industry what it is, queer audiences actually are reliable...you ungrateful shits.

Howard Ashman, a lyricist, wrote some of Disney's best material (Aladdin, Little Mermaid), won them fucking Golden Globes, Tonys, OSCARS. Did you know that his work on Beauty and the Beast was influenced largely by the stigma of HIV/AIDs he experienced? He died of AIDS, actually. You know how Disney repaid him after cashing in on his work a second time in the remake? They made LA FOU (French for ""The Fool""), a spineless fucking pathetic lackey to the villain kinda, sorta, covertly gay. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. And they do this with coding in the queerless Marvel movies, they did this with characters like Bucky or Loki or Captain Marvel- they love to push all the inneundo and stop short as soon you they cash your checks. When they do compromise? Oh it's a weeping, condescending cameo by one of the Russo brothers nobody even noticed. With Star Wars, they said Lando Calrissian is pan pretty much ""coz maybe he fucked a droid?"", they had two Rebel pilots kiss practically off-screen and wanted credit. Also, has anyone seen Raya and the Last Dragon? I've never seen a more thoroughly-trodden lesbian subtext. They'll pull some shit with the Eternals just as paltry and want us all to kiss their feet over it. Fuuuuuck yoooooou.

It's not just Disney, they're just the most prominent. Paramount+ wants their dick sucked today in all the press because their reboot of Rugrats includes Phil and Lil's mother who will definitely, totally be gay. Who gives a shit? She was already a butch lesbian joke in the original series, they don't even have to confirm she's gay, they don't have to change shit.

Why the Eternals Didn't Kick Thanos' Ass.,"Here's what I think, and it's just opinion, so take it with a grain of salt.

Vision said this during Captain America: Civil War: ""Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. Conflict breeds catastrophe.""

I think, if the Eternals stepped in during the Infinity War, Thanos wouldn't have bothered using all six infinity stones. He would know that the Eternals are very powerful, and he'd actually take the fight seriously. And by taking the fight seriously, I mean he would avoid it all together.

He would have just used the power stone to first completely destroy Titan (and Tony Stark and Dr. Strange and Spiderman, etc), then he'd go and wipe out Earth, and then ... well, he'd kill Avengers. 

Thanos, afterwards would probably pick up the Mind Stone in the aftermath and try to Snap his fingers. After all, if Carol Danvers can survive in the vacuum of space, so too can the giant wrinkly plum with the Infinity Gauntlet.

MAYBE Captain Marvel and the Eternals survive, but everyone else would be toast. And sure, they'd probably kick Thanos' ass afterwards, but what would it matter in the end? Earth would be gone. Bye bye everyone.

Anyways, that's why I think the Eternals stayed out of the fight. What do you guys think? Valid, or total shit?",MCUTheories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/nn7ts3/why_the_eternals_didnt_kick_thanos_ass/,Theory,iamnotokaywitthis,nn7ts3,/r/MCUTheories/comments/nn7ts3/why_the_eternals_didnt_kick_thanos_ass/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/nn7ts3/why_the_eternals_didnt_kick_thanos_ass/,5,2021-05-28
"[Excerpts: Ogor Mawtribes Battletome] Ogors can eat absolutely everything, which is hilarious and terrifying","Here are some excerpts from the OM Battletome in which Ogors devour all kinds of things and people, including stuff that is supposed to be utterly inedible. Enjoy! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Nurgle:

&gt;""The worshippers of Nurgle rampage across Ghyran, spreading plague and pestilence. At first, the ogors of that realm are dismayed to find entire stretches of land turned to toxic slurry, but eventually they develop a taste for the stuff. Frostlord Yoruk of the Korbag Alfrostun hunts giant mutated hagfish along the coasts of Glut Lake. Though the gigantic pus-seeping abominations are tremendously difficult to slay, Yoruk judges the hunt to be well worth the risk; he delights in the slimy wetness of their flesh as it slides down his gullet."" 

 Tzeentch:

&gt;""Magister Xerool of the Cult Pandemonius is driven to fury when ogors of the Split Cheek  
Warglutt break into his eldritch tower and devour reams of priceless arcane texts and occult devices. Calling upon his Arcanite Cabal, Xerool unleashes his full sorcerous might against the Split Cheek, blasting the ogors with flesh-warping bolts of wyrdflame and setting packs of capering daemons upon them. However, the vast quantities of forbidden magics that the Split Cheek have devoured begin to repeat on them. Clutching their guts, they vomit up streams of magical fire and bubbling jets of molten silver. One of these unpleasant eruptions catches the unfortunate Magister Xerool full in the face, burning his skull to ashes.""

Kharadron Overlords:

&gt;""Driven entirely insane by his regular consumption of grot shamans and their lunatic concoctions, the Tyrant named Tarrar the Drooler announces that he wishes to eat an entire Kharadron sky-vessel, bolt by bolt. His warglutt attacks the Barak-Zilfin mining outpost of Hailpoint, and before the duardin can retreat upon their Ironclad flagship, Tarrar and his Ironguts clamber aboard and hack the crew into pieces. Over the course of a season, the Tyrant dismantles and consumes the entire sky-vessel, from its vast endrin-spheres to the smallest porthole latches. Unfortunately, just as he gulps down upon the last scrap of metal – the warhead of a grudgesettler bomb – the acid in his gut triggers the explosive. Tarrar explodes in a hail of sloppy flesh and iron shards, splattering his surprised attendants with gore.""

Fyreslayers:

&gt;""Having developed a taste for Magmadroth eggs, Tyrant Blurg Scorchfinger of the Underguts Mawtribe sets his eyes upon Ashen Cradle, a magmahold defended by the Lofnir lodge of Fyreslayers. Scores of blind cavern-rhinoxen are loaded with saddlebags packed to the brim with blastpowder and sent stampeding across the great bronze bridge to the gates of the Cradle,  
terrified Gnoblar riders at their reins. As soon as the Fyreslayers’ elite Magmadroth riders unleash their mounts’ flaming breath, the rhinoxen’s explosive cargo detonates with mountain-shaking force. Chortling with laughter, their ears bleeding, soot-covered Underguts warriors sweep into the magmahold. Scorchfinger feasts well that night, dipping charred duardin limbs into lava-baked Magmadroth eggs.""

Nighthaunt:

&gt;""Furious at the Winterbite Mawtribe’s incursion into the lands of Athanasia, which he claims as his domain alone, the Death God Nagash unleashes the Sorrowful Host upon the Beastclaw Raiders. This innumerable Nighthaunt army sweeps down upon the Winterbite, who fall back before the spectral assault, retreating into the mists of the Everwinter. Masses of Spirit Hosts and Chainghasts follow in pursuit, but such is the supernatural cold of the cursed blizzard that even their ethereal bodies begin to freeze, crystallising into semi-solid matter. The ogors rush to counter-attack, with Icebrow Hunters leading loping packs of Yhetees into the fray and smashing their would-be assailants into shards of ice. The Fraya crunch their brittle foes between their teeth and the Great Necromancer learns a disturbing truth – even the spectral dead are not immune to the eternal hunger of the Everwinter.""

Soulblight Gravelords:

&gt;""The Sanguinarch vampire Contessa Margol de Viresse rules over one of the largest blood-farms in Golvaria. Within the Crimson Gardens of Nescalene, thousands upon thousands of mortal slaves from across the realms are sacrificed daily upon exsanguination tables, their lifeblood drained, blended to the Contessa’s exacting instructions and then bottled to be consumed at her leisure. The tantalising odour of this gruesome distillery reaches the nostrils of the Bloodgullet Mawtribe’s Butchers. They sweep down upon the Gardens, smashing their way through the Contessa’s Blood Knight retinue and hacking apart both Margol de Viresse and her ornate palanquin. In the aftermath of battle, the ogors break into the distilleries of the Crimson Gardens to gorge themselves upon their contents. Drunk on ichor of the rarest vintage, the Bloodgullet depart with great sackfuls of bottled blood, the decapitated head of the Sanguinarch glowering furiously down at them from its place atop a rusty pike.""

Cities of Sigmar:

&gt;""The Coast of Tusks in Ghur has been savaged by the packs of Beastclaw Raiders known locally as the Snow Fiends. Having glutted themselves upon a shipment of prophetic augur-stones from the nearby city of Excelsis, these animalistic savages have launched unerringly well-timed raids upon Freeguild Outrider formations, merchant caravans and shore patrols. All attempts by Vanguard-Hunters of the Knights Excelsior to hunt down and slay the deranged creatures have proved costly and fruitless.""

Stormcast Eternals:

&gt;""The Thunderbellies Mawtribe meets the Lightspear Chamber of the Knights of the Aurora in battle upon the Sky Roads of Chamon. The Stormcast Eternals wish to secure these vital causeways as trade routes between their newly founded strongholds of Order, while the ogors have no intention of allowing their sacred paths to be conquered. Amidst a churning electrical storm, formations of lightning-wreathed Fulminators crash into the Thunderbellies’massed bestial cavalry, the force of the impact very nearly tearing the metal highway apart. Even though the Lightspear’s Dracothian Guard bring down many ogors and their mounts, their charge falters as they are buffeted and crushed under the grinding hooves of Stonehorns and Mournfangs. As slain Knights of the Aurora transform into streaks of celestial lightning, the Thunderbellies rush forward in a desperate attempt to catch the bolts in their gaping maws. Upon returning to their Stormkeep, the Lord-Celestants discover, to their horror, that the souls of many warriors have not made the journey back to Azyr to be reforged. These disappearances are blamed upon the terrible alchemical storms that cloak the Sky Roads, but some Knights of the Aurora believe in a darker truth: the ogors of the Thunderbellies Mawtribe somehow feasted upon the disembodied essence of their comrades.""",AoSLore,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/nn5keb/excerpts_ogor_mawtribes_battletome_ogors_can_eat/,Book Excerpt,lVlarkus,nn5keb,/r/AoSLore/comments/nn5keb/excerpts_ogor_mawtribes_battletome_ogors_can_eat/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/nn5keb/excerpts_ogor_mawtribes_battletome_ogors_can_eat/,17,2021-05-28

"I like the idea of Druig being the ""Hades"" of the Eternals","\*POTENTIAL ETERNALS SPOILERS\*

&amp;#x200B;

In a lot of mythologies, there's usually a god who is depicted as **the outcast amongst their pantheon**. They typically have a personality or powers considered to be terrifying or unnatural and this leads to them to not only be feared by mortals, but also **demonized in lore**, even if they're not actively malicious.

Hades is a prominent example. While the god has definitely done bad things in certain versions of Greek myths, he's definitely villainized a lot more compared to the other Greek gods, mostly because of him being the ruler of the Underworld, and is depicted as the outcast of the Greek pantheon.

Druig can be similar in the MCU. From what I've learned of him, he's an antagonist in the comics and we know based on info from Marvel that in the MCU, he disagrees with the Eternals' feelings on humanity and has become withdrawn from them. Him feeling like an outcast amongst his own ""family"" because he doesn't agree with them and because they care more for humans than him, can add a lot of pathos to the character, especially considering how from what we've seen, they seem to be a very close bunch.",marvelstudios,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nn98p4/i_like_the_idea_of_druig_being_the_hades_of_the/,Discussion,cbekel3618,nn98p4,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nn98p4/i_like_the_idea_of_druig_being_the_hades_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nn98p4/i_like_the_idea_of_druig_being_the_hades_of_the/,7,2021-05-28

I also like having a few creatures in the deck, hence the God Eternal and Bolas Ravager.  I also like planeswalkers, so I would like to have multiple different ones, but if the deck is significantly better without them ill accept it.  Other than Dragon God I don't have any attachment to any specific cards so I am completely willing to swap everything else in favor of better cards.

Interesting section from throwawalien's newer post.,"Here is a little piece of what throawaylien said in his recent post:

""The Friends of Friends have only been here for something like 3000 years. Before that it there were others here to watch us and I think something bad happened and they were completely killed off by the Friends of Friends and they got earth along with everything else that those others had. I don’t know much about those others and this is not a thing I could really ask about so I really filled in some of my understanding here. Whoever the aliens were before, they must have been doing pretty much the same thing as the Friends of Friends because they bothered to take all the videos and everything. But the way Jack and Gina talked about I got the feeling that they didn’t care for those others, like the others might have been their enemies or they might have done something bad. When they talked about it, they didn’t talk about it like it was just a shift change or something. I’m pretty sure there was a war and the Friends of Friends killed all the others. And I’m not sure about this either but I think that the big ship might actually have been built or brought here by those others and not by the Friends of Friends.""

I wonder I this relates to what civilization saw long ago, when there was some sort of all out war in the sky. 

More information on that:

https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/comments/ni11so/it_happened_more_then_once_1561_1566_and_1661_in/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I know what throawaylien said wouldn't necessarily fall into place with these sightings, but then again he did say communication is hard with them. 

Assuming that he is telling the truth, I wonder why we'd be so important to fight a war over? Given his statement, the victor of that war would end up studying us which would mean there is something either special about us or something along those lines. 

This is merely speculation meant to generate conversation but here are some possibilities:

1. We are a science project by the previous others and creating life is illegal. Suppose that this coalition of aliens has some sort of rules. One of those rules is no creation of intelligent life. These previous aliens did just that and as punishment was completely wiped out, or lost any rights to this place. They didn't like that too much and so fought back. They lost, but the Friends of Friends decided not to exterminate us and instead watched us. Or maybe Earth just happened to be where the last battle was fought. 

2. Humanity is special for some unknown reason. So special they were willing to kill/die for whatever it may be.  I have no clue what would make us that special. There are some other entries in throawaylien's newer post that would kind of tie into this: 

""Gina said that there are a lot of different beings out there. I can’t remember if she said thousands or millions, but I think she said millions. And there are millions of planets with life on it, she said, and then there are some forms of life that don’t even have planets. Some planets have just like fungus on them or some fish or plants. But there are I think she said millions of civilizations out there. Many of them are as advanced as hers she said. She said that there are only 7 planets in the whole world that are like the earth where the dominant life form has the simple problems. She called them the simple problems, not me. She didn’t tell me a list of the simple problems, but she told me some of them that were prayer and faith healing and churches and sorcery and magic and all that kind of stuff, mostly all stuff about religion. And of those 7, she said there were only 3 where people experienced deja vu, or believe in prophecies, or that worship idols. We are one of those three and that’s why the Friends of Friends are here. That’s why the others were here, too, and that’s why the next group is coming in July. Gina says that they know that the whole world isn’t really what it looks like but it’s actually the creation of a single intelligence and that we and everything exist inside that intelligence. I asked her if it was like the Matrix and then I explained to her what that was and she said it wasn’t like that at all and so then I asked her if was like when that hospital show ended and it turned out to all be a kid imagining it in a snow globe and she said it wasn’t like that either. But she said that it’s the one thing that everyone in the world agrees on, all these thousands and thousands of advanced civilizations, they apparently all have proof that the world is imaginary or a dream or a computer program or something. And they study earth and the two other planets like it because they are pretty sure that these three planets and the intelligent life on them are either mistakes, like accidents, or else one of them might be the center of the whole thing and everything else is a mistake or an accident. They want to figure out which is which so that they can better understand the intelligence that creates the world.""

Continuing on with point 2, would that research be worth dying or killing for? Suppose you are a hyper advanced race and you know everything, including yourself, is imaginary. One of those planets, the hairless ape planet, is a key to understanding further what everything is, or rather ""why"" everything ""is"". I can see the species that watches us would be very interested in it. Maybe they've made some sort of agreement to take turns watching us until the key is found. 

Lots of what ifs arise from throawaylien's posts. I do not know what to think about it. Him deleting his account makes me think that it is all a sham. ""Adam"" turned out to be a larper, or some sort of marketing campaign for the movie ""The Eternals"" and people are pissed. Throawaylien knows that he too can be doxxed by a few of the internet sleuths who are really good at what they do. This scares him and he wants to not be a part of the fallout that comes post 18th of July. Interestingly he stuck by what he said without flat out saying, ""Sorry homie, it was a joke that went too far."" Makes me wonder if he is telling the truth. I dunno, we will all know something on the 18th of July though. Shittiest part is that there really is no way to prove we are being watched without full disclosure. One cam easily say that only the plan has changed and the plan never included disclosure. One thing is for sure, throawaylien is one of the more popular stories in the history of reddit. Maybe even more so than poop knife, baked potato, and dare I say Kevin. Ok...maybe not Kevin.

Thanks for reading. The thing is, I want to believe him but damn...I hate getting my hopes up because often they are crushed. I am a diehard Cowboys fan for instance. 2014 sucked, 2016 sucked, 2018 sucked but not quite as much as the other two. There's actually been a lot of suck...and 2020...damn, that was just an awful year. The world is going to crap as we speak. Having hope of any sort is in short supply, so I have to be careful where I place it. Anyway, hope this sparks some sort of conversation. Maybe placing a little here won't hurt. 

TL:DR: In the not so distant past our forebears witnessed some sort of war in the sky. Throawaylien mentions war in his newer post. The two could be related, which may give credence to the idea that humanity is special for some reason.",Throawaylien,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Throawaylien/comments/nmqlqr/interesting_section_from_throwawaliens_newer_post/,,The_Calico_Jack,nmqlqr,/r/Throawaylien/comments/nmqlqr/interesting_section_from_throwawaliens_newer_post/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Throawaylien/comments/nmqlqr/interesting_section_from_throwawaliens_newer_post/,92,2021-05-28

"Stormcast Eternals players, why do you like your faction?","I'm primarily a 40k / Fantasy fan, but it seems like every time I look at Age of Sigmar and try to like the Stormcast Eternals, they're just getting dunked on by everyone and their mother. An oft-cited lore tidbit I see a lot was that a Lord Celestant got murdered by the mere handmaiden to Lady Olynder, not even the baddie herself. Do they ever do anything other than get wrecked by Destruction, Chaos and Death? Not only do they seemingly get crushed in the lore, but they aren't really good on tabletop as I understand it. The new ""hype"" trailer for 3rd edition AoS just features the Stormcast reciting how they keep getting their asses kicked before showing it happen again in an almost comedically-fast battle wherein they're obliterated the second they show up. Please help me understand what the appeal is, I have a bunch of Stormcast waiting to be painted and I would like some motivation to get them on the tabletop",ageofsigmar,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ageofsigmar/comments/nnt2wv/stormcast_eternals_players_why_do_you_like_your/,Question,Capnwinters,nnt2wv,/r/ageofsigmar/comments/nnt2wv/stormcast_eternals_players_why_do_you_like_your/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ageofsigmar/comments/nnt2wv/stormcast_eternals_players_why_do_you_like_your/,33,2021-05-29

"Ego, the confused Celestial","It seems as though Ego in Guardians 2 confused his real inert purpose after waking up adrift in space with no memories. 
I say confused bc Celestials generally traverse the universe seeding individual conscious life. Not literally seeding the universe with themselves....

"Which units, FW or otherwise, can be kitbashed, and with what bits?","I've really liked the idea of kitbashing models ever since i learned that was a thing, and since FW units are good, expensive, and are constantly flickering in and out of stock, i figured i would ask. So far I've seen/heard of:

Sagitarrum: Warden bodies, bolter arms.

Discussion: Why didn't Eternals appear in MCU so far,"Not sure if this has been posted/theorised by someone else before. If it has, please feel free to remove this.

So I was reading up on various theories of why Eternals didn't appear in MCU till now and it got me thinking that maybe it's because of Captain America's time travel.

After Endgame, maybe he heard about how Dr Strange looked into the future and there was only 1 scenario out of 14,000,605, in which they could have won. And afterwards, when Cap travels back in time, maybe he ran into Eternals at some point. He might have told them to not interfere as that might deviate/change our Endgame future and might affect the result, so they decided to stay hidden.

Might explain why they never interfered earlier too because Avengers always won (which Cap must have told them) so they didn't feel the need to step in. But now they are coming out because Cap couldn't tell them what happened beyond Endgame's time.

Not sure if this counts as a spoiler, but better safe to be sorry:
&gt;!Maybe the Eternals movie show that they interfered till WWI and then helped with the development of super serum in WWII (I read the bit about serum somewhere else) and then when we had our first super soldier, monitored his progress and didn't have any other world ending incident to step out of hiding - Might also explain why would Eternals listen to Cap to not interfere in the first place. After WWII, the next big event was the attack on NY during Avengers 1 which again Cap must have told them about!&lt;",marvelstudios,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nnnyrs/discussion_why_didnt_eternals_appear_in_mcu_so_far/,Theory,zombie_singh06,nnnyrs,/r/marvelstudios/comments/nnnyrs/discussion_why_didnt_eternals_appear_in_mcu_so_far/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/nnnyrs/discussion_why_didnt_eternals_appear_in_mcu_so_far/,29,2021-05-29

"How Thanos was posthumously retconned from a Greek demigod into an Eternal, despite appearing three years before the Eternals were even conceived","I've seen the connection between Thanos and the Eternals come up a few times online. The understanding seems to be that *Thanos is an Eternal.* Simple and straightforward, right? Sort of. It certainly didn't start out that way. I wanted to share the convoluted background for anyone curious about how these two completely separate creations by different creators got connected…

**[1973: Iron Man #55 by Jim Starlin](https://imgur.com/a/SGmtEWl)**  
**First appearance of Thanos:** Flashback exposition portrays a utopian civilization living beneath the surface of Titan, one of the Moon’s of Saturn. It was this society that Thanos was born into and rebelled against. Desperate for assistance against Thanos’ onslaught, Mentor, the leader of Titan, sought guidance from a cosmic entity known as Kronos, who created Drax the Destroyer to combat Thanos.

**[1973: Captain Marvel #29 by Jim Starlin](https://imgur.com/a/7dQbsf6)**  
**Titan's history revealed:** Later that same year, Starlin continued his Thanos epic in the pages of Captain Marvel and fleshed out the Titanian backstory a little more. Flashback exposition portrays the Titans of Greek myth, Chronos and Uranus in war against one another. Uranus was exiled to the planet that now bears his name. Chronos sired the race of Olympian gods including Zeus and A’lars. After a scientific accident caused Chronos to become of sort of discorporeal cosmic entity, Zeus exiled A’lars, who would travel to the Titan moon. There he discovered a devastated ruins and a lone survivor named Sui-San. He took the name Mentor and with Sui-San, built the utopian society portrayed in Iron Man #55. Ultimately, Starlin’s choice to root the backstory of his character in Greek myth strongly suggest that both Thanos and his brother Eros (Starfox), were originally intended to be comic book incarnations of the Greek figures Thanatos and Eros.

**[1976-1977: The Eternals #1 by Jack Kirby](https://imgur.com/a/5X8oaYg)**  
**The Eternals are created (apart from the Marvel Universe):** Separately, Jack Kirby created the mythos of the Eternals, which seemed to exist apart from the Marvel Universe. Kirby’s series posited the notion that giant space gods used Earth primates to develop three new races: humans, monstrous deviants, and godlike Eternals. The few interactions with these Eternals would spawn the basis of multiple human myths and legends. For instance, exposure to the Eternal Zuras would evolve into that of Zeus, the god of Greek mythology. Kirby’s series would last two years, ending without any kind of conclusion to its grand plot or concepts.

**[1977: Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 by Jim Starlin](https://imgur.com/a/KSofsuq)**  
**Thanos dies:** A month prior to the last issue of Kirby’s series, Starlin’s ongoing Thanos saga which had jumped from the pages of Iron Man to Captain Marvel to Strange Tales to Warlock finally concluded in the two-part Avengers Annual #7 and Marvel Two-in-One Annual #2 with Thanos turned into a statue of granite. Apart from a cosmic dream sequence in The Death of Captain Marvel graphic novel, Thanos was considered dead and gone for over a decade until Starlin brought him back for the Infinity Gauntlet arc.

**[1978: Thor Annual #7, Thor #273-301 by Roy Thomas, with help from Ralph Macchio and Mark Gruenwald](https://imgur.com/a/eYg7mbD)**  
**Eternals formally join the Marvel Universe:** Shortly after Kirby’s series ended, Roy Thomas and Walt Simonson brought the Eternals face-to-face with Thor and into the Marvel Universe proper. This story would be continued in the Thomas’ sprawling so-called Eternals Saga running throughout the pages of Thor well into 1980. Over the course of the long-running arc, Ralph Macchio and Mark Gruenwald — both famed for their devotion to continuity — pitched in on the writing duties on the arc, in which we learn that the Destroyer armor and the enormous Odinsword Kirby portrayed waaayyy back in his Thor run from the 1960s were intended for use against the return of the Celestials.


**[1981: What If…? #23-28 by Ralph Macchio and Mark Gruenwald](https://imgur.com/a/S0pylJN)**  
**Using Starlin backstory to retcon Kirby backstory:** In a series of six canonical backup stories titled “Untold Tales of the Marvel Universe” appearing in the pages of the What If comic, Gruenwald and Macchio reinforced, fleshed out and tweaked the Celestials and Eternals background a bit. Amongst the minor tweaks they made to Kirby’s mythos, the most dramatic element they did was to retcon Starlin’s Titans — Chronos and Uranus were now no longer Greek demigods, but the first generation of Eternals created by the Celestials. So too was A’lars — not a brother to the Olympian Zeus, but to the Eternal Zuras. Also, due to continued advancements of the Earth Eternals after Uranos’ tribe was exiled to space, the Titanian Eternals are physiologically distinct from their Earth counterparts, effectively two distinct subspecies from one another.",Marvel,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/nnj7qy/how_thanos_was_posthumously_retconned_from_a/,Other,bserum,nnj7qy,/r/Marvel/comments/nnj7qy/how_thanos_was_posthumously_retconned_from_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/nnj7qy/how_thanos_was_posthumously_retconned_from_a/,9,2021-05-29

Does anyone else think this Marvel Eternals movie trailer contains some sort of cryptic communication between ET’s and the public?,"https://youtu.be/G8wxsGl-rMA

It’s as if the communication is disguised as a movie trailer. Specifically starting at :49 seconds when she starts talking, it just seems strangely coincidental with all the ufo videos that have been released and especially the upcoming UAP report due in June from US intelligence agencies that she says what she says.

For those that are curious, she says “We have watched. Unguided, we have helped them progress, and seen them accomplish wonders. Throughout the years, we have never interfered... until now.”

All These AoS Reveals... just Reminds me how much I hate AOS,"And it is because of the lore. Or lack of it. 

AoS lore is an insult compared to Fantasy or 40k lore and everything about it is dumb and by extension all of AoS is dumb. In particular everything about the 'Mortal Realms' is so bad I can't believe someone was dumb enough to think that would make a good setting for anything; lore, battles, or anything else. Them trying to add all these maps for the different realms... I

AoS is so bad I can't read more than a few pages without LITERALLY wanting to throw it in the fire and being in a bad mood the rest of the day. Just seeing GW pushing AoS like it is a dumpster fire failure right now is doing the same thing. 

Can you tell stories like Gotrex and Felix or Grey Seer Thanoquil in Mortal Realms? Not really. 

Oh, and Stormcast Eternals are the dumbest thing ever. Their lore is complete garbage; no surprise since it is fundamentally tied to Mortal Realms garbage. But even their Aesthetic, a complete rip off of Space Marines, is a joke. Just play Space Marines.  In general I HATE how they mindlessly just made AoS try to mimic 40k lore. It doesn't work. Not at all. Don't Bastardize Warhammer Fantasy on top of having NO CREATIVE ABILITY WHATSOEVER to add to it.

X-Men changes are not different but inevitable,"This just came to me, but I realized something when reading Hickman''s X-men is that what the X-Men are doing is not out of the blue from a comic book standpoint. As we knew when the Celestials experimented on man, they made man have the genes to not only gain abilities when exposed to radiation like cosmic rays instead of getting tumor. But the genes were also the X-genes that led to mutants. I realized that the mutants on Krakoa are merely repeating things with another group of people that the celestials experimented- The eternals. It kinds of makes sense with their revival protocol being like the eternals' machine, that despite being from earth, have ties the universe with Xavier's daughter being the empress of the Shi'ar empire and the eternals having Thanos. It also makes sense since the eternals who were once defenders of humanity left them and went off a hedonistic path like the mutants are doing now. The relationship between them and orchis is like the eternal's relationship between the deviants, a powerful race vs a technologically advanced one.

"Which (Earth born) race would you want to be, on Earth-616, given the choice?","Mutant: Risk of becoming a blob creature or an omega level mutant. Hated and feared by some other races. You get to visit Krakoa and are basically immortal due to the Five. Robots and humans are trying to kill you currently and constantly.

Inhumans: The Kree might try and kill you or enslave you. You might be a blob or become one with the universe if you go through terrigeneisis. You're still stronger, smarter, more durable and agile, and will live longer than humans and mutants naturally. You get to live in a floating city of wonders.

Atlantian: You can only breathe out of water naturally  for an hour. You're stronger, faster, more durable and agile than humans and will live longer. Namor is your king.

Human: You run the risk of being cannon fodder, watching events from the sidelines, never seeing said events, or if youre possible rich, don a suit of armour and fight crime. 

Human Mutate: Depending on the source of your powers, you might be a strong as a spider the size of a human or be blind with a sixth sense. You still get to be considered human while being better than them.

Other Earthborn races include but aren't limited to; 

Eternals (could commit suicide at notice, become mortal because some man trapped in a child's body becomes bored, or be a slave for your immortal, powerful life).

Deviant: (You will always look unique, but be considered ugly by most standards. You're looked down upon, and your genetic code is random. You might have cool powers, you might just be monstrously ugly and die like a human would of old age.)

"Source magic as ""souls"" and possible missed ending opportunity?","**So heavy spoiler warning**. And apologies if I misremember some story beat as it's been a while.

Does anybody else get the impression that there was a potentially better ending with the choice from Lucian? Insofar as WHAT source magic is?

Source magic, we discover, is a mysterious power that's pulled directly from the ""Source Veil"" - the barrier that separates real-space from the void. And that the whole problem with source magic is that it's continually ""picking"" at this interdimensional tear and letting the void creatures in.

To use source, is to weaken the barrier. Along with attracting the void born to the user.

Lucian plan is to drain the source in the world, particularly that which the seven have hoarded, and use it to patch up the tear, to keep the void out forever. Protecting Rivellon and keeping those nightmarish creatures out.

But there's a twist. The seven, in their search for more source after ripping the veil to begin with, made self-replicating meat-puppets in their own images as a ploy to reap more source.

These are the normal people of the world. Each of the races have not invented their gods, but in an interesting subversion, it's the other way around. The gods made their own ""flocks"" to feed upon.

The seven even refer to the godwoken as *""a wolf among a flock of sheep""* and teach the player how to consume them. Which either kills them outright, making their body explode violently. Or turns them into a barely sentient shambling mute, a Silent Monk (with the technique that Braccus pioneered, at least).

On learning this I stopped and exclaimed *""wait....souls. The game is talking about souls? Are the living using unknowing using source as their souls? The thing that is being harvested as they naturally die?""

Therefore I was disappointed to discover that the ending didn't go where I *thought* it was going.

When Lucian gives you the final choice, to lay down your source to mend the veil, I figured he was talking about *all the source, everywhere*. All of the ""artificial"" living people of the world that The Seven created, in order to return Rivallon into a beautiful, pristine state. A natural utopia, without the corrupting influence of The Seven and their flocks. Returning everyone to their normal state as part of the barrier. Not wandering around as livestock to ""rot"" (in the words of the Eternals).

I even strongly suspected that this was the meaning behind the statement *""The entirety of Act 3 has changed quite dramatically""* when the definitive edition was released.

I somehow feel it was a missed opportunity that would have fit well into the setting. You as heroes reaching the final confrontation to discover that ""saving"" Rivallon, would in turn spell doom for all the people who now call it home.",DivinityOriginalSin,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/nocdyz/source_magic_as_souls_and_possible_missed_ending/,DOS2 Discussion,SovietWomble,nocdyz,/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/nocdyz/source_magic_as_souls_and_possible_missed_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DivinityOriginalSin/comments/nocdyz/source_magic_as_souls_and_possible_missed_ending/,6,2021-05-30

"IT'S ALL CONNECTED - ""Gilgamesh"" from The Eternals appears in both Homecoming and The First Avenger!","I saw this tiktok a while back and didn't think much about it. Then came The Eternals trailer which I noticed that the dude appearing in both Spider-Man: Homecoming and Captain America: The First avenger is ""Ma Dong-Seok"" who is portraying the **Eternal** **Gilgamesh** in the upcoming movie! Idk if it's just a coincidence but if it's not it would be fucking crazy, just your normal eternal lurking before our eyes.

"It's that day again... Trinity Sunday... and so, Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic faith. Which faith unless every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. And the catholic faith is this:","That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Essence. For there is one Person of the Father; another of the Son; and another of the Holy Ghost. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, is all one; the Glory equal, the Majesty coeternal. Such as the Father is; such is the Son; and such is the Holy Ghost. The Father uncreated; the Son uncreated; and the Holy Ghost uncreated. The Father unlimited; the Son unlimited; and the Holy Ghost unlimited. The Father eternal; the Son eternal; and the Holy Ghost eternal. And yet they are not three eternals; but one eternal. As also there are not three uncreated; nor three infinites, but one uncreated; and one infinite. So likewise the Father is Almighty; the Son Almighty; and the Holy Ghost Almighty. And yet they are not three Almighties; but one Almighty. So the Father is God; the Son is God; and the Holy Ghost is God. And yet they are not three Gods; but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord; the Son Lord; and the Holy Ghost Lord. And yet not three Lords; but one Lord. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity; to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord; So are we forbidden by the catholic religion; to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords. The Father is made of none; neither created, nor begotten. The Son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created; but begotten. The Holy Ghost is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor created, nor begotten; but proceeding. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Ghost, not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity none is before, or after another; none is greater, or less than another. But the whole three Persons are coeternal, and coequal. So that in all things, as aforesaid; the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, is to be worshipped. He therefore that will be saved, let him thus think of the Trinity.

Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation; that he also believe faithfully the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess; that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man; God, of the Substance [Essence] of the Father; begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the Substance [Essence] of his Mother, born in the world. Perfect God; and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father as touching his Manhood. Who although he is God and Man; yet he is not two, but one Christ. One; not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by assumption of the Manhood into God. One altogether; not by confusion of Substance [Essence]; but by unity of Person. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man; so God and Man is one Christ; Who suffered for our salvation; descended into hell; rose again the third day from the dead. He ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from whence he will come to judge the living and the dead. At whose coming all men will rise again with their bodies; And shall give account for their own works. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting; and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire. This is the catholic faith; which except a man believe truly and firmly, he cannot be saved.",Catholicism,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/nof2q8/its_that_day_again_trinity_sunday_and_so/,,TexanLoneStar,nof2q8,/r/Catholicism/comments/nof2q8/its_that_day_again_trinity_sunday_and_so/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/nof2q8/its_that_day_again_trinity_sunday_and_so/,7,2021-05-30

What got you into Age Of Sigmar lore?,"There is much to love about Age of Sigmar and although it had a rocky start, the Lore as well as the game grew to be something many people enjoy. With so many different factions and cultures, even inside big groups like Stormcast Eternals, there is much too like and nearly everybody can something for them. 

Around 3 years ago, I walked into my local Book store and being a massive Tolkien fan I straight walked a bee-line to the Fantasy shelf. I had also really got into the whole dwarf fan thing around that time, so when I saw Spear of Shadows, with the familiar ""Warhammer"" Tag above it. Having been into the Middle Earth hobby side of GW for (like 8 years ago now) I kinda knew Warhammer but wasn't too into the setting, because I was more interested in other things back then.

But then it hit me. The cover looks interesting enough. There is a dwarf on it, nice. The human looks also very nice! Huh; what's the harm, I said to myself.

On my way home I read the first chapter and got hit by Grungni's introduction and hit me like a brick wall.

Now, many dispossessed models and some years later I can confidently say it was the perfect intro to the hobby.

With AoS 3rd Ed around the Corner, this got me thinking:

So what was your entry point for the Lore? Was it friends, the hobby, the books or youtube?",AoSLore,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/nodpca/what_got_you_into_age_of_sigmar_lore/,,ThurvinFrostbeard,nodpca,/r/AoSLore/comments/nodpca/what_got_you_into_age_of_sigmar_lore/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/nodpca/what_got_you_into_age_of_sigmar_lore/,68,2021-05-30
