"[Spoilers] Just finished Mass Effect 3, is this 'raw emotions' feeling normal.","First off, I must say, what an amazing series. Bioware is amazing when it comes to character development and making you actually feel something for them. Furthermore, not once did I fall into the Evil is Good trope as most sci-fi tends to have happen.   
I first played Mass Effect 2 after winning it in a giveaway. Being my second shooter game ever, after Half Life I did not expect such a deep and rich story. I instantly fell in live with the series and could not wait to buy Mass Effect 1 during the Steam Holiday sale.   
 Mass Effect 1 felt like a step down from Mass Effect 2 combat wise (especially for a Sentinel like me) but story wise I could see why this series has such great origins. I was excited now to see that I could make discussions and meet characters that would effect the next two games. However in my blindness to the story and ignorance, I never learned about the personal missions. Especially the ones that could have helped me gain Wrex's trust. I also fell into the trap of always using Ashley because of her high combat strength. However, Mass Effect has such a great replay value that I would do it all over again just to get to know the characters better, and save Wrex.   
After saving the council, I then moved back on to Mass Effect 2 where this time it was more like meeting old friends than just people for a squad. In the end, I had everyone survive the suicide mission and FemShep romanced Garrus.   
Next came Mass Effect 3. Initially I was afraid that I would be utterly disappointed form everything I heard but instead I was utterly amazed and in awe. However, the numerous squad deaths and decision on Rannoch whrre I coukd it make peace was heart wrenching. Admittedly, I installed JAM Version A and CEM (because I missed the opportunity before super serious mode) because I could not think of having to bear the pain that might come from Shepard not being back with her friends again and also playing Citadel DLC requires some reason for a living Shepard.   
Mass Effect has been the best video game trilogy I have ever played and I would willingly erase it from my mind to experience it all over again.   
I'll add more later as I think of stuff. Thanks for reading.   

E: Please feel free to ask questions, I would love to discuss the ~~game~~ story.   
E2: Sorry for all the typos, I quickly wrote this on my phone before going to bed. Also, I was wondering, how is it that Shepard can walk through the Reaper Conduit but not the Prothean Conduit (she needed the Mako to protect her). Furthermore, I now know who Marauder Shields is, and I certainly hope that it isn't Nihlus. What an even more grim fate that would be.  
E3: ""A Future That Many Will Never See"" and ""An End Once and For All"" are probably the most emotion packed songs I have ever heard. However, I was not as happy with the credit music as that from Mass Effect 1 (the feeling that something terrible just ended but something bigger is to come) and Mass Effect 2 (an epic feeling of success but also threat to come).",masseffect,27,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/41mhwf/spoilers_just_finished_mass_effect_3_is_this_raw/,Spoilers,IanM_56,41mhwf,/r/masseffect/comments/41mhwf/spoilers_just_finished_mass_effect_3_is_this_raw/,https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/41mhwf/spoilers_just_finished_mass_effect_3_is_this_raw/,45,2016-01-19

Theory: All DCCU films with the exception BvS and both Justice League movies are prequels.,"Suicide Squad: I feel like the death of Jason Todd will play out in this movie, maybe that's who the Joker is torturing?
Wonder Woman: Clearly set in World War I based off of what we've seen. 
The Flash/Aquaman/Cyborg: All of them release after the first Justice League movie, there's been speculation that The Flash is an origin story so it would have to be a prequel. And I feel they'd do the same thing with Aquaman and Cyborg.
It's just a theory I've had since the first Suicide Squad trailer and I've been wondering what other people think. I think it's their way of doing what Marvel did, but doing it backwards.

[Help] Who can I cosplay?,"The theme of the event is superheroes, antiheroes and villains from comic books games and movies. It's in April, so I have time to play around a little.

I'm a short (5ft3) female. I usually cosplay Harley, but with suicide squad coming out I don't want to (Have gone out in one of my Harley cosplays recently and got screamed at because ""that's not harley quinn, she wears gold shorts not a ****ing onesie!"" - want to avoid this at all costs.)

I'm not comfortable in PVC catsuits, or heels, I like to keep mostly covered up, and I love a challenging makeup! (training in sfx makeup at the moment)

I can't find any character that I think I could successfully pull off with a budget under £30.

Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

edit: I'm wanting to avoid femme Jokers, Deadpools, super/batgirl, wonder woman...typical ""first thing that springs to mind"" characters.",cosplayers,1,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplayers/comments/41qee5/help_who_can_i_cosplay/,,LostRocker,41qee5,/r/cosplayers/comments/41qee5/help_who_can_i_cosplay/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplayers/comments/41qee5/help_who_can_i_cosplay/,17,2016-01-19

Idea: Techies aghs rework,"So we all know how techies' aghs works, right? Increased damage on ult and true sight doesnt work near mine sign.

I feel like that doesn't give it justice, so here's my idea:

Techies aghs upgrades the scaling of landmines from 150/190/225/260  to 200/250/350/400. For every mine that goes off, the target loses 1 armor for 5 seconds. Suicide squad attack also deals pure damage instead of physical damage now.

The minefield sign is now invisible, and if an enemy hero is nearby it will take any nearby mines in an 800 unit radius and teleport them to the sign itself, auto-detonating them.

Stasis trap now has no delay and an increase in range of 200 units. This makes stasis traps work in a whole different way, because you can no longer put them slightly outside of the lane without creeps triggering them.

And the major upgrade for aghs will be an aftershock effect. Once an enemy is hit by a mine, it will be stunned for 1 second. 10 seconds after an enemy has been damaged by mines, it will take 10% of the of the damage again.

This is my suggestion, feedback would be appreciated :)",DotA2,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/41mk1s/idea_techies_aghs_rework/,Suggestion,Leopardfire123,41mk1s,/r/DotA2/comments/41mk1s/idea_techies_aghs_rework/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/41mk1s/idea_techies_aghs_rework/,8,2016-01-19

"For the Comics-Naive: Potential Energy (Season 2, Episode 10) (Warning: SPOILERS!!!)","GREETINGS FELLOW FLASH FANATICS!!! Welcome to the first FTCN of 2016! It's been a while, but it's good to be back in the swing of things! So, let's launch into some nerdery with turtles and tropes. I still have yet to see the entirety of this episode (DISH TV WHY?), so I'm putting up what I was able to obtain thus far. PLEASE check back later to see the finished product.

____________________

* You know...[I like turtles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNry4PE93Y). More specifically, I've been waiting for a while for our big-bad of the week: **The Turtle**, also sometimes called **Turtle-Man**. In truth, the Turtle hasn't had too many appearances, but...I dunno, I always liked the guy. Ever since this series came out, I'd been looking forward to seeing the Turtle show up. Two separate individuals have taken up the Turtle shell, but let's talk about [the first Turtle](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/1/18154/844910-turtle_nocostume.png). First appearing in 1945's All-Flash #21, the Turtle was a fairly regular enemy of Jay Garrick. However, he didn't actually have any superpowers. Instead, he was simply very slow and deliberate when planning his crimes. Garrick would do his thing and prevent the Turtle's crimes regularly. But then, after the retirement of many superheroes, including Garrick, the Turtle seemingly disappeared as well. However, during both Garrick and Flash's relative absences, a second Turtle came onto the scene to battle the current Flash at the time, Barry Allen. This new Turtle, calling himself the Turtle-Man, was a fan of the original, and also planned his crimes slowly and deliberately. He was also, incidentally, the first costumed villain that Barry Allen ever faced, first appearing in 1956's [Showcase #4](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/f/fc/Showcase_4.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070104213243). This Turtle-Man eventually started to build devices that were themed around slowness. It's the Silver Age, don't question it. But, time after time, Barry defeated this second Turtle. Then, after Barry's death, the two Turtles finally met and banded together. It turned out that, during his absence, the original Turtle gained power in the underworld over time, eventually building a criminal empire in Garrick's hometown, Keystone City. And he did so while sitting in [this magnificent chair](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/a/a4/Turtle_001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091019102011). He met up with his successor, and recuited him because of his inventing skills and experise. However, the Turtle-Man is crippled by a lab explosion, and the original worked to destroy the Flash at the time, Wally West. He attempted this with a long and complicated plan that involved actresses, dead dogs (not really dead, though), bombs, the Joker, ultrasound, babies...look, long complicated plans are the Turtle's MO. The longer and slower the plan, the better. Anyway, that ended pretty catastrophically, as the second Turtle was arrested, and the first Turtle was killed in an explosion. [Or...was he?](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/0/3146/112072-132330-turtle.jpg) It turned out that the first Turtle survived the explosion, and was eventually found and arrested. But while in prison, he found that he had obtained a metahuman ability: the ability to steal speed from everything around him. In addition, the Turtle had been at least 100 years old at that point, and was seemgly as long-lived as his namesake. And so, he used this ability to escape, then froze the entirety of Keystone City in revenge. Wally West did manage to defeat him, but it wasn't easy, as would be expected. The Turtle...I dunno, he's just always been one of my favorite Flash villains for some reason. Maybe it's the gimmick, maybe it's the power. Maybe it's the fac that he was a villain in the first Flash comic I ever read. Or maybe...I like turtles. It's possible.

* There was a quick name drop of **Markovia** when talking about the painting (which is a REAL painting, and not a reference, just to be clear). And Markovia has the potential to be a VERY important place in the DCTV universe. See, Markovia is a small eastern European country with a long and troubled history. Ruled by the Markov family, Markovia was attacked and nearly destroyed by the Nazis in World War II. At some point after this, two heirs were born: Brion and Gregor. Additionally, the king has an illegitimate daughter, Tara. Tara was sent to the USA to avoid and problems from the public, whilst Brion and gregor remained in the country. But then, when the evil Baron Bedlam (YES THAT IS HIS NAME) staged a coup, the younger Prince Brion volunteered for an experiment performed by local doctor Helga Jace. This experiment linked him to the Earth, turning him into the hero Geo-Force. However, his father was kille during this coup, and Gregor became king. With te help of Batman and a group of other heroes, Geo-Force fended off other villains for hire, such as the Bad Samaritan and the Masters of Disaster (STOP LAUGHING; they were actually pretty great stories). Gregor sent Brion off to the USA to go to school, and ruled the country with his wife Ilona. Until he was assasinated. Of course. His son (well, unborn son) becomes the new king, and...well, Markovia mostly disappeared after this point. There have been any other appearances since, but none that represented a significant moment in the DC Universe. But why on Earth would any of this enter into the DCTV universe? Because it's already been mentioned in *Arrow*! It's actually appeared in there, as a location visited by the Suicide Squad. And, more importantly, it's been mentioned in connection with the terrorist organization H.I.V.E.. And that's a WHILE OTHER thing. Honestly, the most interesting thing that could happen with Markovia is the appearance of Geo-Force. And, actually...we've already seen Katana in *Arrow*. All we need now is Metamorpho (who's also been referenced in the DCTV universe), *Halo* (OK, we don't need Halo, but I've always liked her), and...well, we're not getting Batman, but the other Outsiders are a possilibity. This could be the beginning of something very big!

* **EDIT** (1/21/16): Thanks to /u/NaijaBird for pointing this one out! I unfortunately only caught the episode on live-stream, so I wasn't able to catch that the name of the library was at the time I wrote this article. **The Turtle's headquarters** is in the abandoned **Naydel Library**, where his wife used to work. This is a reference to Martin Naydel, one of DCs artists in the 40s, and one of the creators of the Turtle. He drew for both *All-Star Comics* and, of course, *All-Flash Comics*. Outside of that, he's not very well-known. But kudos to the writers for throwing in this obscure reference!

* I just wanna say that **the departure of Patty** is truly saddening, at least to me. However...it was predestined. And not just because the relationship was doomed by Barry's future with Iris. In the comics, Patty was in love with Barry, but that love was unreciprocated. She took a job in Blue Valley, Nebraska, both to leave a somewhat tumultuous department at the time, and to get her mind off of Barry Allen. She would eventually return to Central City, and would enter a relationship with Barry during the New 52. But Patty was always supposed to leave, guys. Sadly...this ending was inevitable. Honestly, I'm just glad she didn't die. Goodbye, Patty. You were a pretty good love interest, all things considered.

* Patty's been accepted to a program in a college in **Midway City**, apparently. We've mentioned Midway before, but I'll save you all the search and repeat what was said then here. Although there actually IS a Midway City in our world (in California), the comic book version of Midway City a Chicago-like city in Michigan. Like most invented cities in DC Comics, Midway is the home of Hawkman and Hawkgirl during the Silver Age. The Doom Patrol, a team composed on superpowered outcasts, is also based there for a period of time, until being kicked out of the city for causing them too much money in damages. Outside of having a fairly prominent natural history museum (where the original Hawkman, Carter Hall, worked as curator), Midway didn’t really have much history in the DC Universe, outside of bit appearances now and then. Its biggest appearance was in the recent Final Crisis, where it was mostly destroyed and irradiated by Darkseid’s forces. But outside of that…yeah, not very significant as DC cities go. But, given that the Hawks are now in the DCTV Universe, we may see more of Midway City after all.

* Well, well, well, well, well...**Eobard Thawne has returned**. More importantly, he's referred to as ""Professor"" by Gideon. That is most likely a reference to his comic book identity as **Professor Zoom**. ""But"", you ask, ""how is that remotely possible? Isn't he supposed to be eradicated from the timeline?"" Well, in the promo for next week's episode, Harry says something about this being his ""origin story."" But, you know what? I'm gonna elaborate more on that next time. In the meantime, I'm gonna get ready for Thursday!
___________________________

Well, there you have it, guys! Not a particularly long one this time around, but I'm happy with it! If I missed anything, let me know! In truth, I haven't seen the episode very smoothly, so I'll have to rewatch to see if I've missed anything. If you'd like another FTCN before next week, be sure to go to the Legends of Tomorrow subreddit, where I'll start with FTCNs there every Thursday. And those...those are gonna be interesting in their own right. I've also started to do these for *Supergirl*, finally, so check that out on Monday nights! In any case, I'll see you later, fellow Flash fanatics!

"The New Exodus Vanguard [Final, last part]","Riding at dangerous speeds between low hills, the group headed for the rift to the next world while their current one cultivated a rising forest of explosions. Beams of yellow energy sliced across the clear sky above, while bombs on high arcs hit nearby artillery. None of the Grey Riders had spare attention to notice them, or, if they did, there were higher priorities. On this battlefield, human meant ally. It was unlikely that the enraged demi-goddess would be able to tell them apart, and it was unclear whether she would even care about the distinction.
 
Everywhere the squad turned, grey-clad men were taking position behind high portable walls of energy, tanks and artillery were moving forward, and random flak was killing those too slow to find cover in time. Each anonymous soldier that became fatally wounded disappeared in a flash of purple.
 
“They have suicide pyramids on automatic triggers,” Cheng realized. “To hide their identities even after death.”
 
“That’s insane,” Clint responded, riding close. “Who the hell are these people?”
 
Mona flinched as a barrage landed too close for comfort, showering her with snow. “Anybody’s guess. But the blood I drew from the girl charred of its own accord in the syringe. It’s useless. There’s got to be some sort of nanotechnological mechanism in their circulatory system that destroys the blood if drawn or spilled.”
 
The girl in question rode in their middle, her manner tense. She did not try to slow them down or interfere with the escape; she had been told she would be released at the portal, and she was likely terrified besides. There was no way she had seen combat before, or, if she had, it had not become second nature to her yet.
 
Edgar spared a moment to watch the movements of distant Grey Rider squadrons under fire. How many of them were young, old, or out of place on a battlefield? Just what the hell was going on here?! And what was so goddamn important that they had to conscript teenage girls and attach automatic suicide mechanisms to their own soldiers? Were these people even fighting under their own volition, or had they been forced into it?
 
But he had no spare thoughts to dwell on those questions now. Errant shrapnel hit his helmet, nearly knocking him over, and the adrenaline-jacked squad instantly veered hard right to avoid a falling line of fire.
 
Far along the speeding landscape, flickering violet and white made itself known. As they took hope, the sky overhead began to turn eerily void and yellow. It was as if night and dawn had come at the same time, each mixed together in mutual chaos, and that hope dimmed in their hearts. The collective roar of their engines rose as each man and woman used precious turbo fuel. If ever there was a time for speed, it was this.
 
A lone rider in grey approached from the left, heading to intercept at top speed. The squad tensed for the space of several nearby explosions until a voice came over the radio: Lian.
 
“How’d you get a Grey Rider uniform?” Mona asked.
 
Lian slid effortlessly into formation, but did not answer.
 
The snow-covered earth beneath their wheels began to rumble at a greater intensity than the engines themselves.
 
Cheng spoke to countermand what they were all feeling. “We’ll make it.”

Winter’s chill left the air, and a strange heat overtook them from behind.

Edgar held his breath, expecting pain at any moment; the portal rose in perspective and shot past around them, bringing sudden relief. He waved the rest of the squad on to a safe distance while he turned and brought their hostage to the edge of flickering violet. Remaining on his stationary bike with the kickstand down, he waved her forward with his gun. She sat on her bike and looked back, clearly fearful behind her black visor, but she did not move.

The enemy’s frequency was quieter now that many individual squads had switched primarily to team channels, but it still flowed with tense commands and grim chatter. “It’s the Vanguard squad here. We need Kendrick. We still have the hostage.”

Nobody seemed to hear or respond to his request. It was a tough time, he knew, but surely someone had to be in charge of the captive? He repeated his hails for several minutes, watching as light and fire flared across the other reality’s horizon. How could an exchange be made if nobody responded?

A particularly heavy strike beyond shook the ground; Edgar felt a subtle wave of nausea as his eyes registered shaking while his feet remained steady. In the distance, another lone rider approached. The stranger lacked a helmet, and seemed strangely—

Kendrick! Edgar pulled slightly to the side of the rectangular violet rift, wary. When his scarred captain finally pulled through and came to a stop without incident, Edgar took off his helmet and said, “What happened?”

“Go.” Kendrick waved off their hostage. The girl took off at full speed without hesitation, heading right back into the fray. Breathing hard from adrenaline, he said, “They let me go.” 

Edgar frowned. “They just *let you go?*”

“They had bigger fish to fry,” he elaborated with an unhappy and pensive expression. “But I lost my helmet, and they confiscated my handheld radio when they first captured me.”

Handing his over, Edgar felt a strange sensation nipping at the edge of his thoughts. On the surface, this all made sense, but something about it felt wrong. What were the motivations of this enemy? What did the Grey Riders want? Without knowing these things, their moves were impossible to predict. Was that why they spent so much effort hiding their identities? Did they simply want to maintain unpredictability?

“Let’s continue,” Kendrick said on his handheld. “I’m back, and time is still short.”

The rest of the squad radioed happy cheers at his return, but Edgar just followed his friend and captain in a distant daze while his brain churned endlessly over unknowable variables.

The ride began anew, as all were eager to put that ongoing battle far behind them. 

But that was not truly possible, as war raged across the entire region. They would witness two smaller battles between Grey Rider legions and the forces of Her Glory before they finally reached Randy Ellwood.

---

I’ve managed to access a sensor tower, and even set up a small shelter inside it, but Her Glory’s calendar system isn’t the same as ours. Son of a bitch! Is this a cruel joke? Why is simply *figuring out what day it is* the hardest thing in existence?

I think it might be because the date and time only matter to a civilization—and we have no civilization left. Looking at these system reports, Her Glory has kept an eye on not only her own worlds, but many nearby regions as well. With the Shield around the First World Empire gone, there should be *something.* Her sensor tendrils grow under the ground all over the place; they’ve not gone that far yet, but there should still be *something.* Radio signals, maybe. Life signs? Is that a thing? Our homeland is a wounded sphere of silence, colorized only by general temperature readings taken at a distance.

I don’t know what units she’s using, so I can’t tell how cold it is, but the average temperature for our homeland in her data is -24.02. That can’t be too bad, right? It feels cold outside here, but not lethal, and it says the temperature in this reality averages 11.40. I’d prefer to use Celcius, but I don’t know it by instinctive feel; I’m guessing it’s roughly forty to fifty degrees Fahrenheit here, which might put temperatures there at… negative eighty… but I refuse to believe that. I have no way of knowing for sure, and I hate not knowing for sure.

And even if it *is* that cold, it’s still survivable. And it’s just an average over the whole region. There are probably warmer parts of the Earth, and warmer realities, and two hundred billion people working hard to survive. They’re alive and they’re fine. I have to believe that to be the case.

But our tribe, as it was put to us—the three hundred and fifty billion who could not be provided for, the tribe that we were supposed to lead into exodus—I can see them on this sensor network, spreading out into the multiverse on foot like a massive cloud dispersing into darkness. They didn’t wait for us, couldn’t wait for us; or we didn’t succeed in finding a place for them , or we didn’t return in time, or we were never meant to return at all. Every plan humanity has ever had has fallen apart. Now we walk, scattered, into the wilderness.

I wonder what they’re eating. I’m out of food myself.

And worst of all, the old civilization has been broken from us. If we can’t even say for sure what day it is, after thousands of years of the day and time being known to exact degrees thanks to the mechanisms of society, then we are no longer the same people. We are no longer descended from that Empire. Who are we without a calendar? We’ll have to make our own, but it’ll never be legitimate.

How many days has it been? I’m not even bothering to keep track anymore. I’m hungry, and I’m sick, but I know all I have to do is hole up in here and Kendrick will come. They’ll all come. They jumped into the portals. I saw them escape. They’re alive.

But there are too many riders out there to find my particular family. There are Vanguard dispersed all over, but there are far more of the strangers in grey. I can see them on visual feeds, but they don’t register at all on any other data collection mechanisms. I find that very odd. There are three entire realities, too, that have gone silent on the map. They’re there; they’re just blank. Tracing the path we took, I recognize one of them as Amber Two.

The connection is obvious, but I can’t fathom it. Why would the inhabitants of the Amber Worlds be maneuvering around Her Glory’s devastated lands in such a military fashion? And why did they betray our best shot at salvation?

I built a radio out of parts stripped from these machines and tapped into nearby signals yesterday. Sometimes, I get Grey Rider chatter. Their robotic voices grate on my ears, but I keep hoping to catch some hint of what day it is. They talk of timelines and dates often, but their references are all over the place.

Also, after days spent studying maps of the region, I finally found a way out. The far end of Her Glory’s domain was far less scrambled by the Devastation, so her wall realities are still in place. Nobody would survive a trip through one of them. Even at top speed, a trip through one of them cost us half of Kendrick. Those barriers are still in place—all except for one. The distant end of Her Glory’s lands curve along her walls like a bowl down to a hole where fluid might drain. All roads lead to that passage.

Funny thing: I’m not hungry anymore. I wonder how long I’ve been here. Does the hunger stop when you’re too far gone? Well, then I’ll trade one type of energy for another. I’ll continue this entry after I sleep.

“Where is she?” Kendrick asked, studying the jade cliffs with a wary eye. “I don’t like this at all.”

Clint pointed west, along the base of the high jutting crystalline landscape, and the squad continued on along the oddly smooth and beautifully transparent landscape. The light of the sun lit an entire ocean floor in stasis underneath their feet, as if they were riding atop stationary waves, and it was hard not to look down in wonder.

“Keep an eye out for amethysts,” Kendrick ordered on his handheld. “We have no idea if the truce is still on, or if they even understand the concept.” He spied a strange biomechanical tower in the distance. “That it?”

Clint nodded.

As the tower grew nearer, they could see immense mechanical-organic conduits growing underneath the crystal like the roots of some vast tree. About a half-mile distant, violet and white shimmered underneath jade. The roots emerged directly from that light, appearing as if from nowhere.

“It’s growing,” Mona said, mirroring what they were all thinking. “Her Glory’s technology is growing into the fractures!”

“I don’t know how to feel about that,” Kendrick muttered. “And I’m certain the Gemstone Hegemony won’t take kindly to it. They still probably think we completed our initial task and destroyed her, but finding us here—who knows what they’ll think.” He checked an abandoned bike on its side against the tower, and called upward. “Randy!” No response came. “*RANDY!*” He turned to Clint. “You sure she’s up there?”

“Certain.” Clint narrowed his eyes. “This close, I can practically see her. She’s lying down—no, I think she’s asleep.”

Concerned, Kendrick said, “Wait here,” and he put up his kickstand before leaving his bike and gripping the tower. There were numerous handholds and ledges, each blinking and moving in their own ways, and the thirty feet up presented little challenge.

The rest of the squad waited while Kendrick clambered inside the natural bolthole at the top.

Cheng kept watch on the jade cliffs above. Clint nervously bit at his fingernails. Edgar and Mona shared a glance. In her grey uniform, black helmet still on, Lian sat atop her bike and did not move a single millimeter.

The shout came a minute or two later. “*Mona! Get up here!*” There was a pause. “*Edgar too!*”

The two shared a far more worried glance, grabbed their relevant gear, and then sprinted toward the tower. Climbing up as quickly as was safe, they pushed into the bolthole one after the other. The small space within was filled with makeshift monitors and a hand-crafted radio. Supplies sat littered in various corners, and Kendrick was near the greatest pile, leaning over someone.

Mona’s medical training kept her calm as she studied the sight. Edgar went pale and clenched his fist.

Randy was asleep alright—and the biomechanisms had grown along her body. Into it, even.

Kendrick turned to them, eyes wide. “Edgar, get on these computers. Figure out whatever you can. Mona—”

She nodded before he even gave the order. “Cut those fucking things out of her.”

“Right.”

They both moved to action, but space was tight. Feeling leadership fall to her since the situation was medical, Mona said, “Kendrick. You have to wait outside.”

Despite his visible fear for Randy, Kendrick accepted the order and climbed out.

“Alright,” Mona murmured, leaning close to study her patient by the multi-colored light given off by random nodes lining the inner workings of the biomachinery tower. Thin fiber cables had wormed their way through Randy’s clothing and into her skin, especially around her ankles, waist, and neck. Thicker metal conduits appeared to have drilled straight into her head. “Ed, find out what you can about the ones connected to her brain. See if it’s safe to simply cut them. And find out if they’re trying to kill her.”

He went to work immediately, tapping away at a keyboard that Randy had somehow stimulated into growth—among other tools. There was one thing he already knew. “They’re not trying to kill her,” he said, his eyes on his work. “Human brains have been interfaced with her systems before, acting as critical command and relay nodes.”

Processing this, Mona said, “Then we can’t do anything that will risk her life, because death is not already on the line. Worst case scenario: we leave her like this.”

That caught Edgar’s attention, and he turned to look at her in pained dismay.

“Hurry,” she said, getting out her tools to begin cutting away the fibers around her patient’s ankles. First, she removed Randy’s boots and sliced bits of uniform away. The redhead’s skin held mottled bumps where the fibers had penetrated and connected to her nervous system. Reaching up, she stuffed a lump of cloth into the girl’s lax mouth to keep her from biting off her own tongue. “Randy, I hope you can hear me: this is going to hurt.”

But no response came. Stilling her shaking hand using the calm of years of practice, Mona donned plastic gloves, wiped some disinfectant on the target area, and then brought her scalpel to her squadmate’s skin.

The glowing nodes in their cramped little surgical room flickered as the incision brought a swell of blood.

Both Edgar and Mona paused.

Edgar said it first. “She’s connected in some way.”

Wary, but lacking any other option, Mona began cutting again. The colored lights dimmed, and she brought out a flashlight; operating by its beam, she carefully pulled the first squid-like fibers out of her patient’s ankle.

Subtle vibrations moved through the machinery around them.

Edgar gulped, but Mona did not flinch. She kept gently pulling fibers out until the entire cable was freed. Coiling up the loose end and placing the bloody mess far away from her, she stitched up the incision and moved to the other ankle without wasting even a heartbeat.

The tower reacted around them at this second incision, but there was nothing to be done. Cutting and pulling quicker now that she understood what she was dealing with, Mona removed each fiber cable one by one, moving up her patient’s body until the surgeries became more complex in her neck region. Covered in sweat, but hyper-focused, she delicately removed each fiber and sealed up her entry wounds until only the major metal conduits at Randy’s temples remained.

It was then that Edgar spoke. “I’ve got it. See here on this screen? They haven’t penetrated her brain yet. They don’t drill, they grow. They’re slowly integrating with the bone tissue of her skull right now.”

“How’s this thing going to react when we mess with these bigger conduits?” Mona asked, catching her breath.

“Not well.” Edgar gave her an apologetic expression. “They’re higher priority. Its automatic systems will classify it as an attack, and it’ll try to defend itself.”

Mona stripped off her bloodied gloves and threw them with the piled fiber cables. “Alright. Wait down below.”

“You sure?”

She nodded unhappily. “And get ready in case she and I have to jump—or fall.”

“We’ll get you,” Edgar promised.

She grabbed him as he turned to climb out—and kissed him hard without warning.

Red-faced, he stammered, “What—”

“Just go.”

He grinned sheepishly, but did as he was told.

She returned to her patient. There was not going to be an easy way to do this: cutting through metal that thick was possible, but it would certainly not be quick. If the tower was going to defend itself, the danger was extremely high. On top of that, if the decision to leave Randy here like this was going to be made, it would have to be made alone. She would climb down and tell them Randy had died, and Clint would hopefully get her hint and back up her lie. It would have to be that way, because Kendrick would never leave a squadmate behind—and certainly not Randy, his closest friend.

Sweat dripped from her nose. This time, it was not from the exertion of an hour of careful surgery.

But what if there were merits to Kendrick’s stance? Existence had tried to be harsh, tried to be cruel, tried to be mocking—and he’d simply said *no* at every turn. Could one really just say *no* to Fate?

Heart pounding, she carefully placed supports for the metal conduits so that they would not shear too badly, and then aimed her gun at one of them. How long would she have before the tower reacted? And what form would its self-defense take? If it simply crushed both of them—no, it didn’t have that kind of rapid response strength. Like Edgar said, it grew slowly. Would its defense, then, be a projectile? Electricity? She trembled mightily, her finger on the trigger, her gun pointed right at the conduit next to Randy’s temple. It wasn’t an ideal surgical tool, but it was the only thing fast enough.

And it was absolutely, one-hundred-percent, beyond a shadow of a doubt *stupid*. That was why Edgar couldn’t be here. It wasn’t the danger: she didn’t want him to see this crass method. She didn’t want him to see that her skills as a doctor were useless in this situation. She didn’t want anyone to see that.

She held her breath and began to squeeze the trigger.

She froze.

Stupid. Why should she do something self-admittedly stupid before all options had been exhausted? There were still greater stupidities to be explored. Putting her gun away, she turned to the keyboard and monitors and began scrolling through systems. This vast network was all connected, right? Then there was one user who could help.

How could she be contacted? Edgar would know how to do it, but he would also likely ask Kendrick if it was a good idea, and the whole thing would be out the window. Was there an instant messenger system on here? Holy shit, there was! A list of connections, too. One by one, she messaged all of them with a simple message: *help*. In effect, it felt like she was praying at an altar to a new kind of goddess.

Halfway down the list, the inside of the tower went dark, and a single light came on, pointed at her. Was this the opportunity she had hoped for? She frantically gestured toward Randy, and explained the situation even if she wasn’t sure her listener spoke English.

The light went off, and she was left in darkness—save for her flashlight still sitting on a small ledge.

A strange metallic little winding sound echoed, and Mona turned quickly, staring.

Randy groaned. “Everything hurts…”

“Be careful,” Mona told her, helping her sit up. “I had to cut you up quite a bit. Let’s get the hell out of here, and then I’ll explain.” She grabbed her equipment while Randy slowly did the same, and, together, the two climbed out and down.

Mona reached the jade surface first, and helped her patient down to the ground. They both turned to find the squad staring at them in wonder.

Randy was weak, but she ran to Kendrick, who laughed happily and ever so gently hugged her back. She pulled him down and kissed his forehead and cheek repeatedly, not caring one bit about his burned skin or bald head. “I thought you were dead! I thought for sure—”

“I was worried you were, too,” he replied, visibly relieved. He looked over. “It had you, but Mona cut you out of that stuff.”

“Yeah,” Mona said, keeping what she had done to herself. “She should be fine, if a little woozy from blood loss for a few hours.”

Randy looked around happily, smiling at each of them, until—“Clint!” she dashed over as quickly as her weakened limbs would allow and smothered him with a massive hug.

Surprised, Clint let it happen. It was the first reaction he’d gotten that was positive; it didn’t matter that Randy didn’t know about his past. He began to openly cry, and hugged her back for long enough that it became awkward. Randy didn’t care, though: she laughed and asked if he’d succeeded in his special mission.

Remembering the cover story he’d told, Kendrick cut in before Clint could respond and said, “Yes. He did.”

“Good on you,” Randy said. “I knew you’d come through.”

A few moments of greetings and hugs followed with other members of the squad, but the mostly-complete reunion was cut short by Cheng’s warning. “Look!”

Dark helmets glinted on jade. Vast legions of Grey Riders glittered on the horizon, heading their way.

“On your bikes!” Kendrick shouted, already revving up. “Let’s go—”

But even as they donned their helmets and began racing after their bald leader, whose head glinted similarly under the sun, they witnessed vast rectangular violet opening onto the sky in the opposite direction, a terrible maw that emitted two floating mountains and surrounding swarms of flying black dots.

Grey Riders closing in on one side, Her Glory Enraged approaching from another, and a jade cliff at their backs, Kendrick called a stop and turned to his squad in alarm. “Options?!”

Mona froze. Had this been her fault? She’d given away their location—but who had freed Randy? Or had that been intentional at all? Had it simply been the effect of the power being cut to prevent further access?

The first option to consider was the vast flat plain that awaited them in their fourth and final direction. The cliff blocked one way, the Grey Riders knew them as enemies now, and, while there was still a chance Her Glory remained friendly to the Vanguard, Lian wore a grey uniform, and there would be little opportunity to explain. The only route left was out onto the vast expanse to the south.

“Rift compass shows nothing out there,” Cheng found.

“That way feels wrong,” Clint added, shaking his head.

Edgar clenched a fist. “Who knows how far that will take us off our path? We’ll never make it to Pixley and Carmen in time.”

Lian finally removed her black helmet and spoke. “If we go that way, we will survive.”

“No!” Kendrick told her. “We stick to the plan. We can still save both Jennifer and Carmen.”

“Oh?” Lian asked, her expression hard. “How tired are you? How many *days* have you been awake? Stimulants can’t last forever.” She looked to Mona.

Mona nodded unhappily. “The hallucinations are going to get worse, and our decision-making is going to fall apart.” She paused as she thought about what she’d done in the tower. “It’s already happening. We’ll start passing out, too. Falling abruptly at fifty miles an hour could be deadly.”

Like a dark angel of despair, Lian sat unmoving and watched with empty eyes.

“*No!*” Kendrick roared, bringing his fist up and slamming it down as hard as he could.

The flat jade cracked in a fractal rupture under the force of his blow.

The other members of the squad backed up a bit on their bikes, awed and concerned.

“Stop considering options that leave people stranded!” he shouted. “That’s *not* what we’re doing! The rest of this insane nightmare be damned, we are *doing this.* We are going to ride until it kills us if that’s what it takes. Be with me on this!”

The others began looking at each other, gauging the general sentiment among their squadmates. The only exception was Cheng, who peered down between his handlebars. “My beloved brothers and sisters, I must inform you: my gas light has come on.”

The seven stood in stunned silence as the dire meaning of that little warning light sank in. Not only was the end of their journey nigh whether or not they wished it, Cheng might have to be left behind in short order—or he would have to ride with someone else, who would then have greater fuel consumption, thereby unzipping the squad as their bikes ran out of fuel faster and faster.

“Everyone check your fuel levels,” Randy said hopefully. “The one with the most should give some to Cheng to balance things out.”

With an eye on the closing pincer of deadly forces, Edgar added, “And hurry.”

While everyone compared fuel gauges, Lian said again: “It’s time to start thinking about survival. The journey is over.”

“Then let’s save Carmen before we stop,” Cheng said quietly. “Please.”

“And leave Jen out there by herself?” Randy asked, distraught.

Kendrick stood in place, still shaking his head. Jaw tense, moisture pooling in his eyes, he shouted, “*The hell with this!*” and struck the ground again with all the force of his rage-filled denial.

The cracks ruptured fully, and the surface gave way. In a tremendous crash and spray of crystalline debris, he and his bike fell out of sight.

There was no time for gawking or confusion. There were tunnels in the jade, invisible due to the lay of the substance, and hands pulled up their captain even as the surprise way forward became clear. There were only two options from their broken juncture: west under Her Glory’s forces, or east under the Grey Riders. The flickering portal back out was east, so Kendrick picked east, and the squad rode through that underground crystalline tube as rapidly as they dared.

The air beneath was musty and stale, but breathable.

“It must let out in various places,” Mona guessed.

No conversation followed that statement. The rumble of legions overhead silenced all thoughts save quiet desperate hope that they would not be noticed. High above, jade silhouettes rolled past at high speed. There was nothing to be done and nowhere to hide, so the squad simply rode and hoped; heart rates high, exhaustion tailing them, they rolled down that tube single file and, at splits, simply chose whichever route went mostly east.

Edgar later wrote that he thought to say: “*Something* made these tubes,” but he realized at the last moment that such a statement would have been a disaster. He’d seen enough movies to know to shut up and accept their luck. His decision was wise, although he’d had it backwards: nothing had made the tubes. Had the squad been on higher ground, they would have found that this world was not of the Gemstone Hegemony at all; it was the jade lake and cliff itself that had been produced by a lethal organism that happened to have been sleeping that year—directly beneath them, invisible in the same way the tubes had been. Speaking down there might have woken it soon enough to endanger the squad, but the battle certainly woke it only minutes later.

The seven were clambering out of a circular exit when it happened, but they were close enough to the exit portal to escape the fracturing crystal lake and leave that reality behind without ever truly understanding the horror they had narrowly missed. Later records would show that the engagement on the Jade Orb was one of the costliest of the entire Anonymous War—to both sides. In a rare hour of cooperation, a beacon broadcasting in all known languages was left, signed by both, warning that no one should ever return there despite the countless survivors left trapped, preserved, and aware in jade.

Knowing none of this, and struggling with the twin demons Exhaustion and Depletion, the squad pushed on, entering the final stretches of the Week of Hell. The road toward Jennifer Pixley became almost entirely one of flight, dodging, and briefly hiding; few realities along the fracture’s primary route were free from combat now.

It became clear that the Grey Riders numbered in the millions at the very least, and Randy’s information for the squad hinted that they had the full might and technology of at least three mostly undamaged Amber Worlds behind them. In a strange twist, the Earths that had been shot off into the multiverse to die for the Empire were now the only functioning civilizations in the greater region: they had been protected ‘til the last by the very mechanisms that had eventually made them prime for sacrifice. Randy wondered aloud if *they* knew what the date and time were, but none were about to ask.

The others processed her words about the Empire being silent and cold, but no one knew what to say. Through worn-torn lands, they rode on in deep silence, using all their energy in peaceful hours simply to stay awake and fight off hallucinations. When they drew near to their destination, none needed Clint’s confirmation.

It turned out that he had been right about Jennifer Pixley: she could take care of herself.

---

I don’t know if I’ll ever see them again, but I hope I will. I dare to call them friends and family in my head. After I finally got free from that abusive bastard back home, I thought I’d never be able to care about other people. Every bond was just a betrayal waiting to happen, and that’s why I volunteered to secretly carry a different agenda than the squad. It’s funny how far away that seems now—and yet still relevant.

It’s time to get humanity the hell out of here. The Grey Riders and Her Glory have both gone insane, and these worlds are on fire. There are some of us Vanguard left, and a good number of them have given me the secret sign when we’ve met. It seems our collective agenda has not only survived the great scattering from Her Glory’s Heart, but grown stronger as the rest of the Vanguard has weakened.

Twelve riders came with me from the Heart, and we’ve gathered two hundred more along the natural pathways that now seem to be fading. It’s not enough to maintain bio-diversity, but there is also a tide coming in—refugees. Countless refugees. They’re worried about food, because they haven’t eaten in weeks. Instead of turning on each other, they’ve begun cutting off limbs and feeding them to their children. It’s noble, but they can’t see the bigger picture.

I probably won’t be able to either, soon, since I’m out of food, too. Worse, women that don’t get enough calories can’t have children. The bigger picture may be out of our reach for that singular overriding need. We lived in a civilization overrun with food, and now we’re fading without it. If we do manage to get these people to start having babies, things have to be different next time.

We’ll get that food. We’ve stumbled across an Amber World pretending to be someplace else. They have the food we need, and we’re *not* going to ask.

---

The squad emerged from what had formerly been a highly guarded violet portal. For the first time in weeks, they found themselves not in the wilderness, but in a city. Smooth brick walls shot right up to heaven, and sidewalk concrete bumped under their wheels. A wide green sign for a coffee shop caught the eye on the left, and a sandwich chain on the right made the place feel like any city back home. It should have been a relief.

But the streets of this city were not clean. A staggering array of blood spatters, scorch marks, and bits of gore littered an area full of heavy gun placements. Two burning tanks faced each other, their main cannons down, their demeanors depressed.

“Is this a hallucination?” Kendrick asked, struggling to keep his eyes open.

Nobody wanted to confirm that the horrible city blocks full of death were real.

It was Mona, scanning for survivors, who noticed first. “Where are the bodies?”

Cheng pointed. “It looks like they’ve been dragged away.”

Distant gunfire echoed.

Kendrick forced himself to greater wakefulness. “It’s not over! We have to help them!”

While they all kicked up their stands and readied to move, Randy said, “Wait one second—” She grabbed a stray riding helmet that looked Vanguard and handed it to Kendrick. “It’s not safe for you to ride without one, and it’s harder to communicate. Edgar is still missing a handheld, but this is a step in the right direction.”

He smiled as he took the helmet and slipped back into its secure embrace. Randy had been through a strange experience, but some things never changed.

And it *was* Vanguard. The others were too tired to catch the reveal, but Kendrick was forced to see it: Vanguard riders were here. Had they been helping, and gotten caught up in the crossfire of whatever threat had pushed through this portal?

They veered around skyscraper corners and rode down streets filled with burning cars, shattered storefronts, and random debris from damage higher up on the buildings. “Radio silence,” Kendrick murmured, instead leading by hand signals.

The others didn’t need to be told. Something was seriously wrong here. There was no sign of Her Glory’s armadas, which tended to fly in great swarms, and there were no bodies. Clint pointed up twice and then down to his knee, indicating that Jennifer Pixley was *that way* but *getting closer.* His face, seen through his visor, was fearful.

They rolled quietly around another corner—and saw them.

Dirty beyond comprehension, missing limbs in many cases, and ravenous, a good twenty of the creatures sat around a bonfire *cooking and eating* pieces of bodies from a massive pile of gore and death. The larger ones passed cooked pieces to the smaller ones—

Horrified and praying this was a hallucination, Kendrick pulled out his gun, and the others did the same.

“Shit,” Mona interrupted, taking off her helmet to speak without her radio. “Those are humans!”

There were tears of disgust and rage in more than one pair of eyes. Backing up slowly as they comprehended who and what they were seeing, the squad each took another stimulant and tried to keep it together.

“I understand,” Edgar gasped, vomiting once. “I get it—” He choked for a moment, and then breathed in. “This is the consequence of us failing our mission.”

“No,” Randy countered, wiping tears away. “We were never really intended to succeed. We were sent away to start anew.”

Lian offered her brutal perspective. “Those people should have died in the cold. They are now a problem; a threat to our survival, and to the continuation of the species.”

“I won’t kill them,” Cheng said quietly. “They’ve got children with them.”

“If they’re eating people, it’s likely prion disease will become rampant,” Mona forced out between disgusted breaths. “They’ll all go insane and die in a few years. Seven years, maybe more.”

Kendrick held his new helmet in his hands and leaned his forehead against the skyscraper’s wall. “But there’s a chance they won’t, right?”

“A chance. Individually. En masse, though, there *will* be deaths.”

Clint added his point. “Pixley’s not far away.”

“She is likely in danger,” Cheng said, casting aside other concerns.

Kendrick nodded. “Let’s get her and get far away from this place.”

The scavengers were no threat to seven experienced riders on motorbikes. Racing past between abandoned cars, the squad completely bypassed them. Feasting as they were, the dirty families hardly took notice.

More gunfire echoed ahead, punctuated by several booms that sounded like artillery. The squad came around a corner to see a huge number of riders speeding through the streets, using their agility to frustrate a massive tank and its slow-moving cannon. The armored vehicle had been gutted underneath, and could not move. The riders themselves were all wearing Vanguard uniforms.

"Weekly Discussion Thread - January 20, 2015","Hey there honorary Justice League Members - another week, and another discussion thread! 

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Green Lantern* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Green Lantern"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

That means that unless your comment is feedback about the thread or a comment about the week, you should only be replying to other comments.

If there's something you want to discuss and you don't see it, tell me in a comment and I'll edit it in!

As always, spoiler boxes are not required unless you deem it necessary, after all it's incredibly easy to avoid spoilers due to the way this is set up.

"Regardless of how Batman v Superman does, the DCEU is safe. It's going ahead.","For starters, just to clarify I think Batman v Superman will be amazing, critics will like it (even if it's only 'like' and not 'love'), fans will like it, and it'll make a killing at the box office (that much should be certain, so I'm not sure why people worry), and it'll be a roaring kickoff for the rest of the DCEU.

However, I often see it said if BVS fails it'll be the ""end"" of the DCEU, and I say if anything the special today completely disproved that. We are getting a Justice League movie, no question. Suicide Squad is DONE and set to be a massive hit if the trailer's any indicator. Wonder Woman much the same as Suicide Squad looks great, and will probably do well.

The point? Even in the unlikely event things do go wrong for WB with BVS, the DCEU isn't then ""doomed"" as some say. We'll have five entries into it by the end of next year, that can't be disputed, and I think they'll all do well enough to merit the franchise continuing.

A Theory About the Suicide Squad Big Bad,"So as we all know, the cast of Suicide Squad is going to be full of villains. And as of the recent trailer, there seems to be an Antagonist with control of vine like items. So, this got me thinking, what if the antagonist of the film, isn't a bad guy , but a good guy. A good guy named Swamp Thing. What if in this universe Swamp Thing is presented as an eco terrorist with goals in direct conflict with the government. Here's the twist though, he's still a good guy. You'll be following the whole film, rooting for the villains, until the very end, when you see them take down someone who actually is a hero. Something to shock us back to reality, remind is these people we've been following really are the villains.",DC_Cinematic,9,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/41smrz/a_theory_about_the_suicide_squad_big_bad/,DISCUSSION,cliser1129,41smrz,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/41smrz/a_theory_about_the_suicide_squad_big_bad/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/41smrz/a_theory_about_the_suicide_squad_big_bad/,8,2016-01-20

Is Mantis the Suicide Squad Subway Monster?,"After seeing the official suicide squad trailer I began a frantic search for answers as to who the huge green subway monster might be.

I’ve came across several theories but none of which seem to fit.

I'll begin by discounting the various other suspects.
(Or you could skip straight to the explanation at the end for why I think this is Mantis).

1) Martian Manhunter:
One thought is that the green being is Martian Manhunter who had somehow escaped a government facility and the Suicide Squad were sent instead of Batman and Superman as the government wanted to keep the existence of another alien secret.
As much as I wish this was true I don't think this creature in the SS trailer is similar in appearance to the classic Manhunter image (shape-shifting aside). I also don't see why he would destroy the train as opposed to just phasing through it and I doubt there are any immediate plans to include Martian Manhunter in the DCCU since he had recently been introduced in Supergirl.

2) Poison Ivy or Swamp Thing:
Whist both would be an excellent addition to the film I don't think either of them fit as there is nothing natural about the subway monster. Take a look a still image’s below and you'll see that it appears far more alien / otherworldly than anything you would expect to see from a nature based character. Plus the general cinema going audience could get confused between Swamp Thing and Marvel’s Groot.

3) Hawkman / Hawgirl villain:
I also considered that the subway monster may be a Thanagarian villain from Hawkman / Hawkgirl lore since this section of movie appears to be set at Central Station in Midway City where they are both curators of the Midway City Museum. I discounted this mainly due to my lack of knowledge of these characters but also since they have both been recently introduced in Legends of Tomorrow.

4) Demon raised by Enchantress:
Whilst Enchantress clearly plays an important role in this film, I don't think the green subway monster is anything magical, nor is it any type of demon summoned by Enchantress. It’s just far too brightly coloured, but again this is partly due to my lack of knowledge of this character.

5) The Tattooed Man (Possibly played by Common):
This seems to be the Internet favourite so far, particularly when considering the leaked set photo's of Common in costume, complete with various tattoo's including a tentacle inked on the side of his head which may explain the tentacle shooting out of the monster’s hand in the trailer. It has yet to be officially confirmed what role Common will be playing, and I believe that the set photo's are an intentional misdirected, a distraction from a larger, more important role that he may have.

If the Subway Monster is The Tattooed Man then where is the goatee and piercings as seen on the leaked set pics of Common? 

[Subway Monster compared to Tattooed Man] 
(http://i.imgur.com/dwL2GqD.jpg) 

My main issue with the Tattooed Man is that he is not large enough to be the subway monster. Looking at the below side view still shots the creature walking on the subway track is at least 9 or 10 feet tall, given that the tracks will be approx 3 feet lower than the platform the soldiers are kneeling on. Plus the monster is clearly covered in a bright green and yellow armour which looks a lot like some form of energy armour or futuristic / alien-tech.
(I doubt that the armour indicates any involvement of either Lex Luthor or Brainic as I feel this is currently too advanced for Lex and I dont think DC will confuse matters by including Brainiac when Darkseid is already hinted at through the inclusion of Parademons in the BvS trailer. Also from what we have seen from Aquaman I don’t think this is Atlantean tech either.).
I think the armour looks far more otherworldly, like the armour seen on characters from the Forth World New Gods of New Genesis and Apokolips.
The other problem with the Tattooed Man theory is that there is no way he is that powerful, I can buy that he can conjure up various constructs from his tattoos... But there is no way he is powerful enough to cause an entire train or a humvee or a concrete pillar to be disintegrated! The subway monster doesn't just rip apart the train, it is dissolves as he touches it, destroyed at an atomic level. Tattooed Man is not that powerful.
COULD IT BE MANTIS???
In light of this I think the green subway monster is Darksied’s right hand man, the second most powerful being on Apokolips --- Mantis.
This would link the Suicide Squad movie to the rest of the DCCU as Darksied has already been hinted at, well at least the parademons have been.
Mantis’s various power include Immortality, Energy Absorption, Energy Manipulation, Energy Projection and an ability to destroy anything he touches by creating Antimatter.
I believe that the tentacles shooting out of hands could be a visual representation of Mantis’s ability to manipulate and project energy and the train which can be seen to disintegrate in front of him is a demonstration of his use of Antimatter.
When looking at the still images below the first thing that stands out to me is colours of Green and Yellow that are consistent with the classic comic book colours of Mantis. The second point to notice is the ornate headgear which looks like it could be a stylistic approach to the comic book character’s bug-like mask and helmet. Lastly the detail that stood out to me was the banded gauntlets worn around his wrists / forearms which is very similar to the comics.
Also since Mantis is a Forth World being, second in command to Darksied, he would presumably be huge and powerful looking figure similar to the 9-10 tall subway monster.
The monster’s tentacles also leaving a trail of devastation where everything destroyed becomes a blackened mess and I think this is remnants of destructive power of the Antimatter.
Finally, for anyone who watched the Dawn of the Justice League TV Special, Suicide Squad director David Ayer stated “it’ll be a big surprise for the fans how interconnected all these movies are”. It would take more than just a Batman cameo to make SS and BvS interconnected. I assume he means that there were will be a central story arc throughout all movies, like a Darksied invasion?
I don’t think Common is playing the Tattooed Man, I think that is an intention misdirect and that he us actually playing Mantis of Apokokips. My reasons for this is that when looking at the rear view images below, it could be argued that the person beneath the armour is Common. The dark skin, bald head and general shape of his ears seem to fit.
Take a look at the image below and let me know what you think, Do you agree or disagree? Do you have suggestions for any other possibilities?

UPDATE -  26th January 2016:
Today more still images of Batman V Superman were released  by Empire Magazine. One very important image adds to the nightmare sequence featured in the trailer which showed a glimpse of parademons.

The below image clearly hints at Darksied through the massive omega symbol imprinted on the ground with a destroyed city in the background and pillars of fire erupting from the ground.

[Batman V Superman - Darksied Omega Symbol] 
(http://i.imgur.com/cVSJ0dh.jpg)

If Batman dreamt the entire sequence where did he get the idea of parademons and where does he get the vision of the omega symbol? I don't think this is merely a nightmare, it shows that Darksied is coming and will be a future villian of the Justice League. 

I think this confirms Darksied will be a future threat in the DCCU and supports the above theory that the Suicide Squad subway monster is Mantis. 

I feel that the reason Mantis appears in Suicide Squad is that he is sent to Earth by Darksied to carry out reconnaissance by establishing desirable resources and organisms that can be harvested and what threats could be expected from a future invasion.

Suicide Squad trailer popularity,"Just looking at the official Suicide Squad Twitter (@SuicideSquadWB). The trailer has 60k retweets. 

That's nearly as much as Batman V Superman(34k) and Civil War(32k) combined. I'm only using the official movie pages because so many different pages post trailers but the interest in this movie is insane. The trailers barely been out a day and already has this much hype and interest than the other two 'main' movies.

VS Compendium - Maximising 1-12 for everyone.,"So, aside from the great tips from /u/PolishTamales found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureFight/comments/41w1lp/postpatch_19_villain_siege_tips/), we've decided to come up with some of the better ways to get through the All-New, All-Difficult VS experience - from start to end.

###Getting through the usual 1-9 (Perhaps with Bonuses)

Bonus characters are randomly selected, not a ""This character is incredibly awesome and will destroy this boss"". To stay relatively neutral on whether it's actually worth using the bonus 3 characters, keep in mind that:

- Previous PSA of Bonus Characters changing up on restarting the game is inconsistent at best, YMMV.
- In a roster of 66 characters, you'll burn 27 at **least**, some of them being your stronger/favourite/easier to use characters.
- VS7-9 might demand that you use other characters to somewhat weaken the boss before bringing in the 3 bonus characters for the bonus rewards, leaving you even less characters for the much harder VS10-12
- Refresher Tips for 7-9: Tag to stop Maestro's Meteors, Tag 2 seconds after Venom's Parasitic Shot to avoid damage completely, Get silk to cheese Blingpin.

(For those who have yet to try out bonus characters and such, for every bonus character you **complete** the boss with, you get one extra ""Bonus Reward Box"". 1 Bonus Character, 1 Box. 2 Characters, 2 Boxes. Etc. http://imgur.com/5vrrqcq)

To help you decide, here's a quick breakdown of the possible bonus rewards possible (One caveat - my sample size isn't big enough as of yet ( &lt; 300 at the moment) so take this as more anecdotal. I intend to have this bumped up to at least a thousand. Feel free to comment with your results that are **larger**, preferably with pictorial evidence.

&gt; |Reward Type|Min-Max|
&gt; |:-:|:-:|
Gold|3k to 25k
ISO|1 Pc 1Star to 1pc 2Star 
Norn Stones|1 to 3pc 
Debris|1 to 4Pc
Gear Up Kits|1 to 3Pc
Character Bios|1Pc

###Planning the VS Experience

Lets not turn this into a second job. It's pretty easy to break down - how deep is your roster. 

Are you /u/Goodsituation and can smash V-12 out using only bonus characters while stroking his pet cat like an evil supervillain? Or are you limited by X number of full 6* 60s, some half-mastered 6*s, etc. Only **you** know best. 

Just remember that the general power progression of a single character (not relative to other ""God"" tier, ""Crap"" tier, etc.) is usually; in order of priority - 

1. Rank
2. Mastery
3. 8-Set ISO
4. Leveled Up Essential Skills (Summon / Shield / Group Buff / Self Buff)
5. Star/Enhancement Level of the ISOs used
6. Rest of the Skills.

You decide for yourself if its worth going for the bonuses at the risk of not being able to complete higher stages.

###With great power comes great electricity bills. VS10-12

**Preamble** Some useful things to note (some that might even run contrary to the pointers above). VIP heal helps, and you don't have to be VIP200 for it. Anecdotally, my first day's VS was completed by just: Using the 5 and 6 star skills then swapping characters, and I had it covered under 20 characters (all 6* 60). If your roster has this breadth/depth to it, you probably won't be needing much help.

**Some generics:**

1. Time is actually your greatest enemy with the quick-swap strategy. I ran out of time more often than losing characters (only lost a couple to Loki ever.)

2. Leadership is **key**. Energy Attack % Leader? Fill the other 2 slots with energy attack characters. 

3. I would suggest ignoring team-up bonuses if one is aiming to maximise bonuses from 1-9 simply because of the increase in crazy planning required.

4. Great AOE is incredibly important.

5. As mentioned by /u/PolishTamales, maxed gear sets are always great, more damage, less time spent. Some slight disagreements with his tips though, I'd point out that Skill CD % isn't as important as it seems because you **will** go through a few characters during your first few days of attempts. I also do not recommend using Loki his way (box of clones). The bosses are mobile (Shield Backpedal, Ultron Jump Smash, YJ i-frames.) It's far safer to keep the boss in front of your own clones V-formation. *I'll debate you on your thread /u/PolishTamales !*

**~~As we're still unsure if VS10-12 sequence of bosses will change up, no sense in speculating just yet.~~ Sequences change. HP levels remain the same. Onto the individual specifics (Saving Loki for last, since he's the hardest by far)** - 

##YJ - Ye Olde King of Reddit Hype (Now overthrown by Silk)

Why start with YJ recommendations first? Because this is where you burn your strongest speed characters. The only other time you've had a chance to was at Blingpin (maybe Malekith, but no one cares about him aside from a certain Roenism). 

**Quick Recap**: Criss-crossing train-tracks, red glow indicates incoming train (Operator Thogar from WoW anyone?), annyoing spiderbots Bullseye Style.

**Recommended Characters**: 

* The classic speed AB team of SC/Widow/Silk are fantastic here. With increased damage against YJ and the Spiderbots, decent AOE, etc.
* Green Goblin: another classic hero. Great kite-ability, decent AOE from his 3* skill once spiderbots start bunching up.
* Spider-Gwen/Miles/Original /u/Spedwards : AOE CC abiltiies, great mobility. Spidey's 6* also bashes everyone together for more happy fun times.
* Elsa: Her 3* ability's potential to lock up everything is fantastic, her 6* has decent AOE and the rest of her skillset locks up YJ pretty well.
* Bucky Shoutout. Break, break and more break. His 5* skill tumbles him backwards nicely to avoid stuff, his 6* does great AOE. Also, wonderful buff to armor up himself or his teammates.

**Blast/Uni Characters of Note** (Don't use Combat ffs): 
*Caveat - I left out some possible options because I prefer using them at Ultron*

* Wasp. Great Leadership, fantastic movement, i-frames, etc will help you avoid everything in the map.
* Coulson. With correct team setup (Strikers that proc on him attacking or getting attacked), you'll have 4 characters out for the price of one - Coulson, the striker, Capt, May. His 5* skill is also great for decimating everything in range. 
* Red Skull. AOE stun with 5* skill. His 1* Ability (Rapid Fire) also pierces.
* Angela. Wonderful 6* to control bot positioning, 5* does great AOE damage, 1* (War Rage) has great single target damage on YJ, 2* (Blades of Ichor) leaves a flame pool *a la* Ghost Rider if you have her ANAD uniform. I'd prefer leaving her as witchhunter for more damage though.
* ANAD Rocket. Understandably very niche. But the 5 mines from his uniform do great, he's one of the very few characters that can stand at distance and lay down the law, with a nice self-healing 6* massive AOE to boot. 
* Deathlok. He no likey machine. He also has nice 6* AOE, 3* AOE, 2* Covering Fire AOE locks up everything in a cone in front of him. 5* direct damage and his 1* (Combat Shootout) passively backpedals him. 

**Quick Tips**

*Don't overstress yourself with the incoming trains. They don't hurt that much. Or tag another character. 
*Feel free to kite the bots the same way in Team-Up/VS Bullseye. Plus points if you can make them blow up on him, but generally blowing everything up with AOE helps. 

##Ultron - Think of it as beating up on /u/Spedwards, it helps

**Quick Recap** No stage obstacles, just Ultron and all his minions to beat on. No strings attached here.

**Recommended Characters**: 
*Also another caveat, I suggest saving the big guns for Loki of course, so these are the better AOE characters that help chop ~~/u/Spedwards~~ Ultron and his minions faster*

* Black Bolt. BB just **wrecks** this stage. His 6* smashes everything around **and** stuns them to boot, 5* gives a temporary shield to shrug off some damage. Rest of his kit synergizes perfectly.

* Lincoln, Thor. Similar to BB. How do we fight Ultron? **WE BLOW UP EVERYTHING**

**Quick Tips**
* He's really not as tough as he's made out to be (Ultron, not Sped)
* AOE, AOE, AOE, AOE.
* Did I mention AOE?
* Don't forget to AOE.
* AOE stands for Area of Effect (Damage)
* Also, AOE.

## Loki (Low key Lyesmith. +Love for whoever gets the reference)

**Quick Recap**

Ahh. The Flavour of the Month(s) has now come back to bite everyone in the backend. Much credit to /u/PolishTamales for covering most of the tips, I'll just quickly cover what I think are the important ones that I think should be emphasised. 

At just short of a million HP (952158) to be exact, you fight Loki in his little fortress of solitude, *sans* Superman, and he slowly creates more and more clones (First at 1:45 or so, then one every 10-15 seconds or so) His first clone is always at 10-12 o'clock, 2nd at 2-3 o'clock, 3rd at 7 o'clock. He will have a maximum of 4 clones out 40 seconds into the fight, most likely encircling the entire arena (but at times leaving you with a small quadrant untouched)

**Recommended Characters**: 
Your biggest guns need to come out here. Bring out your own Lady Loki to seduce him, or Blingpin to cook him in the rice cooker that Fisk seems to be stuck in. Leadership is everything, you need as much damage in the first 10 clone-less seconds as possible, 

* Captain America is a wonderful recommendation by the man I've credited enough in this guide. Constant bashing with 5 and 6* skills will help you passively avoid many of the clone's scepter bolts.
*  Big-hitter characters will make a huge difference. Combat-wise, I put out Hulk (WWH Costume), Goliath and Blade (Both Costumes) and just facesmashed him as hard as possible in the first 30 seconds before dodging is an issue. I managed to shred close to 60% with Goliath's 5* and 3*, Blade's 6* and 5* and all of Hulk's skillset before having them drop like flies.
* More combat love: She-Hulk Leadership, Warwolf 6* Buff Stacking for her to start throwing Buses instead of Taxis.
* Coulson. With correct team setup (Strikers that proc on him attacking or getting attacked), you'll have 4 characters out for the price of one - Coulson, the striker, Capt, May. With the added benefit of more fodder that the clones/Loki will be aiming add so you an lay down your directorship.
* Nico (Sister Grimm) - Same deal, clones to distract, great 6* and Punish damage when done right.
* Blingpin - I'm not copy-pasta-ing the above anymore.

I won't be recommending as many, because everyone has very different strengths and playstyles. I prefer brute force myself, I brought Loki down with 3 x 3 sets of characters and went ham on him, and had to find out all this additional info on an alternate account (taking it slowly). 

**Quick Tips**

* Do **NOT** Retry (circumstantial, but 99% of the time you shouldn't). You will retry with the clones already present in the arena. **IF** you get incredibly lucky and the clones are extremely bunched up in one quadrant - I've seen a scenario with them at 8, 10, 12 and 1 o'clock, consider going for it. (P.S.  /u/PolishTamales , clones do not spawn at a quicker rate when you exit and retry)

* It **IS** possible to **TRY** game the clone position if you are willing to sacrifice some lowbies to get the above point's scenario. As mentioned, the first clone is very often at the 10 o'clock positioning. If you sacrifice lower level characters by just running in circles for 10 seconds and dying THEN retrying, there's a chance the clones will spawn near each other in that one quadrant.

* If you get by a Sceptre Bolt **TAG A DIFFERENT CHARACTER IMMEDIATELY**. Don't take the damage over time unnecessarily. Although sometimes you get frozen and die, but welp.

* Be vigilant. Roll, Tumble, Be Mobile, Use i-frames, Don't use long animation attacks. Brute force works, but only for deep rosters. With proper avoidance, and the ability to string out the full 2 minutes, Loki can be brought down with less than 10 characters.

* It's a 10 character minimum (I assure you.)

* VS Tickets now actually have value.

###In Conclusion

GLHF farming Cho. And thank you NM for a little bit more spice added to the game, but get that &amp;(#$&amp;(#$ UI changed back, its hard to evaluate team setups, etc. etc. see rest of the sub's complaints.

##Edit Log:

- Changed Min/Max Values for VS Bonus Rewards based on more information
- Changed effectiveness of brute force team (more anecdotal, also more effective)
- Added Bios as possible bonus reward
- Edited fact that 10-12 Sequence can change. HP Levels stay the same.

Anyone else happy that they are making Superman the forefront of the DCEU?,"I'm a huge Superman fan and I'm really happy that DC isn't making Batman despite all of his popularity the forefront of he universe. 

Like all of this is happening because of Superman; Waller says that because of Superman's battle with Zod in MoS it was beacon for the crazies with powers and everything to come out (Suicide Squad) or the fact that batman reveals himself in public because of Superman, I bet Wonder Woman came because of what Superman did.

It would've been easy to make Batman the forefront of the universe, making him the one to unite the heroes or something, but we may have Aquaman for that. 

I noticed in the Justice league promo art that Superman is in the middle and in the front and It made me happier because well he's the whole inspiration for the JL, the core of it all and sometimes a leader in the comics. 

I think DC is trying to push Superman more and more as the forefront of the universe starting with the movies and now they're pushing him more as a complex character in things like Injustice or Gods &amp; Monsters,, the comics are making a good portrayal of him as more of a human character it's fantastic.

All in all I'm happy that Superman became the core of the universe and Zack Snyder knows that without Superman there would be no justice league; its really giving the character more exposure as well as rebooting it in the eyes of the public so more fans would like Superman more.

World Building Ideas,"Hey Guys, I've been thinking for awhile about some world building aspects for BnH. Not too much is known in regard to world building so far within the story and I just thought of a couple things that I at least think would be pretty interesting.


-First, in the beginning of the series we were told that only 80% of the world has quirk abilities which leaves 20% without quirks. Now that's a pretty big amount. What if we get some type of Quirkless Superheroes on some Batman type stuff lol or maybe even a badass Quirkless tactical villain like a Joker or even a Quirkless group of heroes or villains?


-Second, We know that in the BnH world the heroes are the day savers which in a way pretty much makes law enforcement officials pretty obsolete in a way. What if there is some bad blood because of that? Perhaps Law enforcement officials can have preconceived notions of Heroes as only in it for the flash and fame and not in it to save the people and perhaps heroes can see Law Enforcement as in their way?


-Third, what if we have like some villains working with Law Enforcement on some Suicide Squad/Shichibukai type stuff? Perhaps working together for a common goal for their own benefits? Maybe less time on their jail sentences perhaps?
That's all I got. What are some of you guys' ideas for BnH world building greatness? Would love to read em!",BokuNoHeroAcademia,12,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/41xvlo/world_building_ideas/,,albertoduro1xx,41xvlo,/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/41xvlo/world_building_ideas/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/41xvlo/world_building_ideas/,15,2016-01-21

Why I WANT Enchantress to be the main villain of Suicide Squad.,"OK, I know the main villain is still unknown, and after seeing both the new trailer AND the trailer for Batman vs Superman, I think DC is planning on stuffing quite a bit into each of these movies, meaning there will likely be multiple villains in both. But even if the protagonists go on multiple forced missions in the Suicide Squad, there will likely be one big bad. Here's why I want it to be Enchantress.


I'll start with this. Imagine essentially Alma from F.E.A.R. but the government sending super powered villains after her. That would be so mind blowingly enjoyable to watch! It would also strengthen the idea that this is a suicide mission/cruel and unusual punishment for the squad. The team COULD be going up against some terrorist like the Joker, or some other super powered mutant like the Tattooed Man, or even some Alien or Cybernetic villain, all standard action movie villains. But what if the Government saw a supernatural HORROR movie type villain. You know? The type of villain that kills off every main character until you think it's finally dead except it turns out its not in the last 5 seconds of the movie. ""Hey, if it were a robot or a terrorist we'd just send a missile firing drone after it, but since its a demon/ghost/witch possessed young girl with powers and an existence we mortals cant even comprehend...we're going to send you after it. Good Luck!""  I think that'd be so fun. Marvel has been criticized for having generic, non-memorable antagonists. Well I think something like the girl from the Ring would be super unpredictable and so fun to watch super powered badasses try to figure out. 


Now, that is why I want it to be the Enchantress, but I'm not sure I think it WILL work out that way. There's no guaranteeing they'll make the Enchantress a creepy Alma or Alessa from Silent Hill or Kayako Saeki from the Grudge type. But given the character design they've gone with and how it differs from the comic book design enough already, I think it's definitely possible.",DC_Cinematic,11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/41xohp/why_i_want_enchantress_to_be_the_main_villain_of/,DISCUSSION,sycophantasy,41xohp,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/41xohp/why_i_want_enchantress_to_be_the_main_villain_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/41xohp/why_i_want_enchantress_to_be_the_main_villain_of/,18,2016-01-21

Future Pop Theory Time #1 - Suicide Squad,"Hey guys,

Well, seeing how quite a few people wanted me to do a regular theory series - I figured I would start with one that, while we know we will get Pops for it - speculating on this one will be fun. That is - the Suicide Squad movie coming this Summer after the BvS movie.

Now, for the record, I'm actually looking forward to this movie more than BvS because in live action form, aside from the Arrow tv series, we haven't seen a lot of villain group centered movies and especially this one, which could arguably be the most recognized bad guy team up group, aside from the Masters of Evil, Legion of Doom, Sinister Six, etc. So, this movie could jumpstart some solo villain/bad guy movies or potential other villain group movies. But let's get started with the analysis before we get to good stuff.

For those who do not know, the Suicide Squad, officially known as Task Force X, is a group of various supervillains that are forced by the U.S. Government to do dangerous missions for them that can literally get them killed, hence the name. If they complete their mission, then they would get reduced jail sentences or receive pardons (but not usually). And if they refuse to comply, then the government activates the bombs they put into their necks and no more jobs, ladies or retirement plans for the bad guys. This is one of the main reasons why the team consistently rotates out members because to the US government, they are disposable &amp; replaceable.

Now, in the original and new 52 DC comics - there are a few staple characters in the group. For example, Amanda Waller is the one who always appears to assemble and lead the Suicide Squad. Deadshot, Captain Boomerang and Harley Quinn have usually appeared together regularly but most of the time, the Suicide Squad changes considerably. For example, in the Arrow tv series, the team consisted of Deadshot, Bronze Tiger, John Diggle, Lyla Michaels, Shrapnel and Amanda Waller/Mockingbird. It has sense changed to include Cupid, Captain Boomerang, King Shark and officially, Harley Quinn. But let's focus the movie version primarily.

Now, for the Suicide Squad movie - I'm going to list to the characters that I personally believe we will see in Pop Forms for various reasons but also on what we know currently since not every character has probably been revealed for the Suicide Squad. Some choices are probably going to be obvious while others are probably wild guesses. I will also list potential exclusives for each character as well based on what we have seen in terms of the trailers, promotional material and other behind the scenes stuff. So, here we go:

**Main Character Pops and Exclusives**

* **Deadshot** - We are obviously getting Deadshot but not just because he is in the movie. The main reason, to me at least, is that we haven't gotten an official Deadshot Pop - not even one from the Batman Arkham series or the Arrow Tv series. And the costume appears to be quite faithful to the original comic design and the Arkham games. The main common Pop will be him wearing his mask obviously. As for exclusives, there will most certainly be an unmasked one since he is seen quite often without his mask on. We could also see him in his prison uniform as well as a variation but probably not likely. There are probably more options but we'll see.

* **Killer Croc** - We are definitely going to get a Killer Croc Pop from this movie and we know how good he looked in Pop form based on the Arkham game version. Now, in terms of exclusives, I would say we are going to get one of him hooded since he appears to wear a hoodie quite frequently &amp; probably a bloody variant since he does pop (no pun intended) out of the water to attack somebody and we know he likes to eat a lot of, let's say, fresh meat. Also, wouldn't suprise me if we get some form of a flocked hoodie version.

* **Captain Boomerang** While I'm not entirely confident about Jai Courtney, he definitely from the trailer reminds me of how Captain Boomerang acted in that animated movie Arkham Assault a couple years back. We also don't have an official Captain Boomerang Pop either, which is weird so the main outfit will be a Common. In terms of exclusives, I would say probably one where he is in his prison uniform or him with his boomerangs and the boomerangs having a metallic finish. Hey, Funko has done weirder stuff before.

* **El Diablo** - While I don't think this character is going to get as much love and attention as the ones we know better, I will say that we haven't gotten a Pop of this character in any incarnation and if he had to have an exclusive, either he would be in his prison uniform or they would do something along the line of maybe his flames having a glow in the dark effect or a new exclusive effect.

* **Enchantress** - Okay, first off - surprised Marvel hasn't gone after DC for this one since they also have a character named the Enchantress who may or may not appear in Thor: Ragnarok. Second, we don't know much about this version of her but hey, we are probably getting a Pop of another new character which is always exciting. I also do know of the speculation that she could be the main villain or a secondary villain but we don't know anything for sure yet. As for exclusives, probably a glow in the dark with markings.

* **Rick Flag Jr** - For those who don't know, Rick Flag in all his incarnations has a long history with the Suicide Squad. From the original Rick Flag Sr who served in the World War II version of the Suicide Squad to his son, also named Rick, involved with the modern Suicide Squad. We also don't have a Rick Flag Pop so this will be something new. As for exclusives, I got nothing right now.

* **Slipknot** - This one kind of perplexes me a bit unless he is either working as a side villain for the main bad guy in the movie or he kind of acts like a side ally with the Squad. But we don't have a Pop of him so I think we should expect one. Exclusives - none.

* **Katana** - This one will always perplex me because why make a new Katana when you have a pretty good one in Arrow already and they pretty much look the same. But anyway, we don't have a Katana pop yet - not even one from Arrow so get ready for one. I would say the common will be the one with the mask on. As for exclusives, I would predict an unmasked version (exclusive to Walgreens) and probably one with a glowing sword since her sword, Soultaker, literally can take and store the souls of those it defeats.

* **Amanda Waller** - Just for giggles, I want to see how they do an Amanda Waller Pop - we don't have one yet and even Arrow didn't get one. I think it would be hilarious to have one to display and you could probably make her Pop alone the convention exclusive.

* **Johnny Frost** - All we know about this guy is that he was a henchman of the Joker in the comics and that is what he is in this movie. Wouldn't surprise me if we get a Pop for him since we have gotten Pops for very obscure characters before. No exclusive.

Now, you are probably thinking - where are those particular two characters you are missing. Did you forget them? No, I didn't but simply put, I left these two for the bottom since to be perfectly frank, these will probably be given the most exclusive treatment and the biggest push for this movie. If we learned anything by now, the characters pushed the most always get the most treatment.

* **Harley Quinn** - There is so much Harley Quinn hype that even before this movie came out, we have over a dozen different Harleys and more I'm forgetting. And more are coming like that white and Strawberry Hot Topic exclusive and the Black Friday one just two months ago. But yes, we probably will get a main Harley Quinn Pop with the baseball bat. As for exclusives, here are some ideas:
    * Harleen Quinzel (before she turned)
    * Harley in jailhouse clothes
    * Harley hanging like a cloth dancer
    * Harley with the silver purse
    * Harley blowing gum

There are so many others that I probably have left out but get ready for a lot with this character. But more so, with this one:

* **Joker** - I think Funko has a thing for Joker because there are so many versions of the Joker we have gotten - we even got a Joker Batman Loot Crate exclusive. So, in terms of common - I think it's going to be Joker in his signature purple suit. In terms of exclusives, oh boy - this is going to bankrupt some people's wallets. But let me get the big one out of the way. 

     * Joker Pop Ride - This has to be the only one that a Pop Ride or even a Dorbz ride would work from this movie. The car is stylish, it would work well with promoting the movie and the design of the car definitely opens up the possibility of having at least this one.

Now, I think at the very least - we are going to get 4 exclusives of the Joker. Here is what I predict are the main four:

* Joker in that tuxedo with the white flower holding a machine gun
* Joker in only white shirt and black pants like in that weapon circle scene
* Joker without his shirt on - only showing his tattoos
* Joker without his shirt holding those tools in the first trailer

Again, I can't imagine what type of exclusives they are going to have for the Joker since Funko loves him so much.

**Creative Picks**

Now, this one is going to be tough since they have pretty much already announced most of the cast members. But if you look on the Wikipedia page for the movie, they are several actors who have not had their role revealed yet, such as Ed Harris or Common. So, I'm going to make some creative picks here and potential Pops.

* **Ed Harris - Rick Flag Sr.** As I mentioned earlier, Rick Flag was a member of the original World War II Suicide Squad so the speculation right now is that Ed Harris could be the father of Rick Flag Jr, played by Joel Kinnaman. A Pop of him would be sweet. 

* **Batman** - While I personally don't believe that Batman will get another Pop so soon since the BvS movie just opens in March  - there has been speculation that the picture shown of Batman in the trailer had some sort of robotic right arm or device on his right arm. And, you know Funko will eat that up quickly so we might get yet another Batman Pop with some sort of robotic arm unless it's Armored Batman again.

* **Alex Meraz - Bronze Tiger** - Now, this is one guy whose role hasn't been clarified yet but if I had to guess who he would be playing - it would be Bronze Tiger. One, Meraz has a background in mixed martial arts and has won numerous karate tournaments. Bronze Tiger is sort of the assassin or martial arts master of the Suicide Squad in most versions. He also could be the character that quells infighting between the Suicide Squad since he really isn't a full bad guy. Plus, who doesn't want to see a humanoid karate tiger? A Pop for this guy would be extremely cool and if we know exclusives, a flocked is obvious and maybe even one with a karate outfit.

* **David Harbour - Antiphon* - I have read about this rumor that the main villain might be this guy called Antiphon who is the leader of a group called Jihad/Onslaught. Apparently, he is a regular antagonist for the Suicide Squad and when I look at this design in the comics and David Harbour - the similarities appear to be there. So, we might get a Pop for this character if we do see him.

* **Common - Tattooed Man** - I have seen production shots of what Common looks like but in terms of what character he is playing - that is not clear. It is speculated that based on his look he could be the minor supervillain Tattooed Man but he really wasn't a member or enemy of the Suicide Squad but he does, at least in the comics, have history with the villain Slipknot, who is in the movie. So, I'm not sure if we might get a Pop of him but if we do, that would be interested to see since we know how tattoos look on Pops.

* **Scott Eastwood - Deathstroke** - It is inevitable that Deathstroke will appear in the DC Cinematic Universe. The question is who is playing him. I even heard a rumor that Arnold Schwarzenegger would be playing him - I laughed out loud for about 5 seconds hearing that since we know how agile and quick Deathstroke. And then, I heard about this guy being a potential Deathstroke and it could be possible since the physical looks about right, he is a soldier and something involving the Suicide Squad could change him into the character. Plus, as a side note - Deathstroke and Slipknot have a bitter feud because in the comics, Slipknot killed Deathstroke's son at some point in the timeline and Deathstroke brought Tattooed Man to help him find Slipknot. Since Slipknot is in here - we could see the beginnings of Deathstroke here and quite possibly, another Deathstroke Pop. Exclusives - probably unmasked and metallic.

So, that's what I have based right now - tell me what you guys think and hopefully, I didn't cause people's wallets to tremble already.

TL:DR - Predictions on Suicide Squad Pops and Creative Picks",funkopop,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/funkopop/comments/422eyk/future_pop_theory_time_1_suicide_squad/,Discussion,ZakarosTarsus,422eyk,/r/funkopop/comments/422eyk/future_pop_theory_time_1_suicide_squad/,https://www.reddit.com/r/funkopop/comments/422eyk/future_pop_theory_time_1_suicide_squad/,1,2016-01-21
Halo 5: Guardians Written Review,"Halo 5 deals with two main characters this time around. Good ol' Master Chief with his Blue Team and John Locke, leader of Team Osiris. And it's pretty good. The campaign itself is pretty short, probably about ten hours, if not less. But there's a lot of quality to be had in this game. The pacing felt a little rushed towards the end, but this was the first time I've played a Halo game (and I've played them all) and was actually INTO the story and felt immersed. 343 Industries tries to fill you in on everyone's role and why now you're playing with a team of spartans instead of going solo like previous installments, and you come to learn how deep the story is and how alive these character's actually are. Only two complaints with the story: One, there wasn't enough of it. Two, while executed fairly well, the ending was predictable and cliched.

**EyeCandy:** The visuals are astounding. There were no texture loading issues, lo-res sections of the map, and care and detail went into all of the environments and models. Halo takes you to different worlds throughout the galaxy and they all feel organic, refreshing, and genuine. All artifacts and landscapes have their own history, fauna, civilization, and at some points was even amazed. This game has moments where you want to stop and take in the scenery and search around the level (because if you know Halo then you know about the skulls and intel). I was truly impressed with what 343 came up with. Once again, only two complaints: One, which is pretty minor, there were sections of the game with water and when you crouch beneath it there's no water effects, the game just becomes clear instead of murky, or blue, or whatever, but it doesn't actually take away from the game. Two, the animations of characters in the distance end up coming off really choppy. At first I thought it was the framerate, but then realized it was how the engine handles in-game events. It looks weird and takes away from the fluidity of the game. But other than those, this game is B-E-A-UTIFUL.

**SoundDesign:** This is easily one of the best part of Halo. As far as sound design goes, I put it right up there with Battlefield and The Witcher. At first I had it coming through my TV speakers and it sounded fine. Nothing great, but not lacking. Then I put on my Astro headset, changed the sound option to 'headphones', and it elevated the game to a whole new level. Each team member's footsteps are differentiating, you can hear the individual breathing of the character's and covenant when you get close, the list goes on. The effects are high quality, all weapons sound realistic and authentic (even the fictionalized ones), and it never blended all together as one muddy ""blah"" in the background when the game or cutscenes got really intense *coughcough*CallofDuty*coughcough* but actually became more immersive the louder I turned the volume up. And the soundtrack is top notch and mixed excellently with all the chaos, yelling, and explosions. The game has three-dimensional sound and you can tell who's far off, who's next to you, what weapons the enemy is using, everything. The main menu's title theme holds plenty of texture and sounds are full and satisfying with a hint of nostalgia, while the battle music amps up every conflict and makes all firefights intense. This is a soundtrack I will purchase. I just wish during the quiet and ambient parts of the game there was a little more melody to give the worlds and environment just a little bit more culture, but honestly that's just a personal preference of mine. Not one complaint in this department. Everything is absolutely perfect.

**Gameplay:** As far as a FPS goes, there's not much to talk about. The story was on the shorter side, BUT there were parts that were straight pissing me off. I played through the campaign on Heroic (hard) difficulty because the game said that for Halo veterans, this difficulty is the best one. So I chose it and launched myself in. Halo puts you through the game with squad members, four in total including yourself. And it ain't no Ghost Recon or anything, but you can ""command"" your squad to go places, focus on enemies, or pick you up when you fall down. But let's take a moment to talk about this AI real quick. Something that Halo as a franchise has always put emphasis on. They utilize the ""feature"" horribly. Your teammates are awful companions and are 'too smart' for their own good which ends up hurting you in the end. What I noticed 343 tried to do was to make your squad tactical, but it leads to a lot of frustration. When the team is told to focus on a certain enemy, only one will focus on said enemy and the guy even told me, and I quote, ""As soon as I kill this soldier, I'll get to him"". Um, no, I'm your commander, I'm your leader, and you do as I say. If I tell you to focus on this enemy because I need some cover fire, then you put your attention on that enemy. If I need suppression so I can flank this turret, then that's what you do. If this were real life, that would be completely understandable. But it's not. And they put in a new feature where instead of dying, you have about 15-20 seconds for a member of your squad to make it you and pick you back up before you actually die. It's so you can get a second chance (you can be dropped infinite times) and keep the momentum and the fight going. BUT a lot of this game was spent waiting for my team and reloading from the last checkpoint because my teammates barely ever revived me. Never mind the countless times I picked them up, they would either be a couple tens of yards away (all three of them) for whatever reason, or they would stand about four feet away from me and watch me bleed out. Just stand there and watch me die. And of course there's no suicide option so you HAVE to wait for them to get you. And the driving, oh Lord the driving, is the worst part of their brain. I sat on the back of a mongoose for a solid half minute while my partner just chose to not drive anywhere. But it's a good thing they didn't because when they did drive somewhere they were too busy flipping over and running into walls ""Austin Power-ing"" themselves while we get shot at and blown up. This is the worst team AI in the Halo series and it was a serious step backwards. But enough about that. The actual missions themselves vary in length and hold a lot of nice variety to keep the game fresh and interesting. Halo has been an open world-esque type of shooter and it plays in nicely and is definitely a good change of pace than the usual go-here-shoot-follow-this-npc formula. The stupidest, and shortest, mission though is when you're at a friendly camp and you have to eavesdrop on people. It was very strange and horribly executed. Other than that, Every gun has a zoom type option, when you jump and aim in mid air, the spartan actually stabilizes himself for a couple seconds so you float and can pull off a couple headshots, but the side to side sway is really slow and can't be edited in the options menu even when the sensitivity is set to a higher amount. I've died from the simple fact that I couldn't turn to shoot the enemy. I couldn't figure out why it played like that, but it did.

**Multiplayer:** Arguably the only reason why Halo ever got to be so popular was because of it's competitive aspect. The company took a little bit of a different take on it and split it into two sections. Arena and Warzone. Arena is the traditional 4v4 Slayer, Swat, the classic halo multiplayer. Warzone is a big team battle where it melds a lot of what other games did. First off, the type I found the most fun was its Warzone mode where it was team against team, with AI enemies included. It consisted of a Battlefront/field type where you take control of certain command points, and at the end destroy the enemie's home base all while killing the Prometheans and Covenant for extra points to win. I experienced very little lag (I think it was me in all honesty) and even when I lost I wanted to keep playing. At the end of each match you gain your experience, and get REQ cards. Their earned when you rank up, or when you buy them. There's three different types of packs, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Which can be bought with the points that are earned in every game, or with an actual credit card transaction. Within the packs are special weapons, boosts, armor upgrades, etc. What it reminded me of was Mass Effect's special packs, Titanfalls cards, and Advanced Warfare's feature where you earn outfit customizations and experience boosts. Overall it's a whole separate experience from the campaign and it's still a hell of a lot of fun.


Halo 5 Guardians is a professional game with faults that shouldn't be holding the game back and can be considered rookie mistakes. But all in all, everything one should expect from Halo is there. Immersive story, excellent score, phenomenal actors, addicting multiplayer, character customization, and worth every dollar. If the AI was polished then it would be a top notch in my book.",ghettotorture,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghettotorture/comments/41yvio/halo_5_guardians_written_review/,,abloobudoo009,41yvio,/r/ghettotorture/comments/41yvio/halo_5_guardians_written_review/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghettotorture/comments/41yvio/halo_5_guardians_written_review/,0,2016-01-21

Suicide Squad Joker Theory!,"Here's how I see it going down. Early in the movie it'll flash back,  Joker is gunna kill Jason Todd, Batman is gunna beat the everlasting shit out of him, nearly killing him. He'll get his shiny new teeth in the hospital, and then this is where Joker and Harleen meet. Joker falls for Harley, she's reluctant. The Joker will probably get his tattoos in prison. Naturally he escapes, but before leaving decides to go see his favorite doctor. He'll put her through some electro shock therapy, somehow she'll get away. The Joker will follow, and this will lead to the chemical bath they end up sharing and create Harley Quinn. They'll be a happy new couple doing crazy things, Batman will catch wind and go to catch them. It's here where I'm thinking he catches Harley but not Joker, and this will be how Harley ends up in prison. Now after this It could go two ways. Harley gets caught and The Joker escapes, orrrrr. I think they both get caught, and The Joker spends the rest of the movie locked up while the Suicide Squad goes to fight the crazy ass monster wreaking havoc. This brings me to my main point! I believe, and it's just a hunch. I believe that by the end of this movie The Joker is going to cut his face off ala the comics. Just a crazy thought I had but it really would make Jared Leto's Joker stand out and just seem crazy as fuck. This might be a little too demented to put in a PG-13 Warner Bros movie but we'll see. They keep saying we're not ready for Jared Leto's Joker, and if he actually beats Jason Todd to death then they'll already be on the darker side of things. We'll see how it all plays out.

‘Suicide Squad’ Trailer 1 Reaction and Review!,"##SuperheroNews.com Description:

We had the pleasure of collaborating with DC Entertainment for their highly-anticipated film Suicide Squad. Through their new fan-verified YouTube channel, [DC Fans](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Ua5arV3Xl5eoDjeP1tvng), we created two videos for the official first trailer.

Behind Waller is 6 pictures, of Harley Quinn, Deadshot[behind Waller], Killer Croc, Captain Boomerang, Slipknot and El Diablo, all in front of the wall they take the pictures in front of to show height in Police Stations(I hope that makes sense with my shitty explanation)

Missing are Rick Flagg, Katana, and Enchantress. We already knew Flagg and Katana were voluntarily a part of the Suicide Squad, but IMO this further proves that Enchantress is there voluntarily, and confirms that the other 6 are all convicts(which we pretty much knew).

[Discussion] Joker's role in Suicide Squad,"(Brace yourselves, this is long)
The title is self-explanatory.
Lets keep in mind 2 things:
•Geoff Johns said Joker isnt exacty a part of the Squad, which gives me the idea that the Squad and Joker will work together at some point.
•Joker and Harley are separated and (knowing Harley) they are sure to reconcile at some point, even if they arent together at the end of the movie.
I was watching the trailer again and caught a glimpse of Bohemian Rapsody's lyrics: ""Do you think you can love me and leave to die?"". Do you guys think that can be a simple explanation as to how Joker and Harley split up? (No, Im not implying this is some kind of hint)
Doesnt it seem too convenient that Joker is free precisely at the right time when the Suicide Squad is assembled? All of this makes me think of these possibilities:
1-Harley abandoned Joker for some reason in a life or death situation and he wants revenge, eventually being forced to ally himself with the SS (less likely to happen)
2-Joker abandoned Harley amidst a life or death situation, she backed away and now Joker wants her back, and tries to regain her trust by working with the SS
3-Joker is the main threat the SS must originally face, and then Enchantress gets out of control, and Joker gets together with them for some reason
4-Joker is just free for the time (no explanation given) and the Squad will go after him, because they need his help
5-Joker and the SS randomly happen to cross paths and eventually ally
6-Joker and the SS cross paths because they have some common interest and that leads to an uneasy alliance

My older siblings have been doing NOTHING besides talking about the new Suicide Squad movie, which I'm fine with IF THEY'D STOP STATING FALSE FACTS.
As a true DC fan, this is annoying. Very annoying, becuase 1: They've always said DC is stupid and marvel is better 2: They've never read a DC comic, or know nothing about them.

Stupid rant, but very annoying. Now, because they've seen a trailer they think they know everything about Suicide Squad and all that.

My Thoughts about the DCEU so far,"What bugs me the most is that people classify DC as just ""Dark movies"" having only seen the Nolan Batman trilogy and Man of Steel.

Although I agree that the darker tone in man of Steel may not have fit the character, I do think it was an interesting take, that really sets up some interesting possibilities for the future of the DCEU. I think, based on the first trailer, that BvS will analyze the implications of Superman's actions, and really develop Superman as a character to a satisfactory level.

I think the DCEU will delve deeper into the different characters and their respective worlds, because each major hero comes from a vastly different and new background. Based on the tv special, it seems like they're really focusing on that aspect of the universe, and that is why I think that each movie released will be its own separate entity, while at the same time, fitting into the bigger universe. I do really enjoy the MCU movies, but they can seem kind of redundant after a while, especially in the character development. No offense to the MCU because they're doing a fantastic job, but it feels to me like those movies are made more to get the biggest box-office draw rather than being a unique and beautiful piece.

That being said, from what I've seen so far, the DCEU seems to be employing a different formula for each of the movies that have been revealed so far, which differs from the cookie-cutter superhero blockbuster that we have gotten used to. BatmanvSuperman looks to be a more psychological view at a conflict between two godlike figures. Where each character is well defined in their motives. It feels to me like kind of a Watchmen vibe, where there is no real ""bad guy"" but more two very powerful people clashing about the right way to do things. However, it will go farther than that to show that there really is a bad guy, Luthor, pulling the strings in the background and causing the conflict. No more speculation about the third act of BvS, but based on the first trailer from Comic-Con, pretty sure that that's what the beginning is about.

Suicide Squad is a more rough and tumble action flick while at the same time bringing together many contrasting characters and viewpoints. I don't think that Ayer will go into motives and backstories for the characters, which is probably a good thing, but each character's personality will be prevalent and distinct for what is, in essence, a dark comedy shoot'em up. From what we've seen of the other movies, they will each have not only their own distinct tone, but also a whole new world to introduce us to for each film.

From what I've seen from the DCEU so far, I have nothing but positive comments, especially the television special, which really gave me confidence in their ability to treasure each specific character and transfer them from the comic books to the big screen without compromising their characteristics for a monetary box-office gain. Really happy with the job they've done so far, and I sure hope they don't prove me wrong.",DC_Cinematic,2,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/423oeu/my_thoughts_about_the_dceu_so_far/,DISCUSSION,ShamWauw,423oeu,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/423oeu/my_thoughts_about_the_dceu_so_far/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/423oeu/my_thoughts_about_the_dceu_so_far/,4,2016-01-22
Suicide Squad is coming,"When I first saw the release info for [Suicide Squad](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386697/) I was not sure if I would want to see it or not.

It already has a [release date in the UK](http://www.filmdates.co.uk/films/8580-suicide-squad/) to which I say let's try to get an outing together.

I do plan to see the film with a friend who does not live in nearby and we will either see it here in Bristol or closer to her (Oxford), I for one am not afraid of seeing it twice but can only do weekends.

"For the Comics-Naive: Pilot, Part 1 (Season 1, Episode 1) (Warning: SPOILERS)","Hello, Legends lovers! I am otusasio451, and I welcome you to the very first FTCN for this series! In case you don't frequent the subreddit for *The Flash* (or, now, the one for *Supergirl*), these posts aim to inform those people non-affiliated with comic books of the history behind the characters and references seen in this show. I've been waiting for this series for a while, especially because it's themed around time-travel, and the potential references are MANY. Ironically, despite this show revolving around time, I'm a touch late with this particular review. But we've got a lot of stuff to discuss. And so, let's jump right into this wibbly-wobbly-timey-wimey stuff!

______________________________

* When Rip Hunter is attempting to appeal to the Council of Time Masters, he lists off a few famous dictators: Ceasar, Hitler, and ...**Per Degaton**. And that is when I knew I'd like this show. [Per Degaton](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/7658/342395-59487-per-degaton.jpg) is an example of an obscure comic book supervillain that really shouldn't be obscure. He'd also be an EXCELLENT fit for this show, and is a character I was hoping to see on this series since it was announced. Why? Well, let's start with his origin. Introduced in 1947's [*All-Star Comics* #35](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/7/7a/All-Star_Comics_35.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090101115922), Degaton (and yes, that's the only name we're ever given for him) was a part of an organization called the Time Trust. The organization had developed time travel, and during World War II, he was tasked with retrieving military secrets from the future. The Nazis and the Justice Society of America ended up getting involved, only for Degaton to sabotage such secrets. He leaves the Trust and joins another group, Project M, which was notable for creating the supernatural paramilitary group known as [the Creature Commandos](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/11352/770407-creaturecommandos_wwt093_01.jpg). However, he left there after meeting the villainous time-traveling robot [Mekanique](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/7/7e/Mekanique_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20110701181959), an enemy of the American superhero group known as the [All-Star Squadron](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/8/87/All-Star_Squadron_02.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100207074522). And it's at this point that you may be thinking ""JUST HOW MUCH STUFF IS LINKED TO THIS CHARACTER'S ORIGINS?"" Exactly. And I haven't even gotten to his actually villainous acts. This one villain has so much DC mythology surrounding him, and his appearance in the show would open so many doors. Anyway, Mekanique teaches Degaton the secrets of time-travel, and the two of them eventually fall in love. With the help of Mekanique and evil scientist Malachi Zee, Degaton builds a device that will allow him to travel 40 years to the future, to 1987. But, when he kills Zee to use the machine for himself, he accidentally causes Zee to fall into the machine, activate it, and travel into the future without him. He lunges into the machine and (now follow me on this one), creates a *chronal duplicate* of himself, due to the energies of the machine. Just...comic books, guys. Go with it. Neither Degaton or his duplicate know this, and the original Degaton is angered by his failure. In a rage, he buries Mekanique (who was only a head at the time), and goes it alone. He joins the Injustice Society (enemies of the Justice Society, clearly), and leads an army to march upon Washington D.C. He's stopped, and sent to prison. He stays in prison until 1987, when the machine is supposed to appear once again. He rebuilds his ex Mekanique, and they go to the machine, only to discover his chronal duplicate. Since you can't have duplicates in the same place at once (time rules, you know), the older Degaton dies. Fearing betrayal again, Mekanique kills the younger chronal duplicate. And that's the end of Degaton. But...what did his chronal duplicate do during this time? Turns out, he went time-hopping, trying the change the course of various historical events. But when he's stopped by the All-Star Squadron and the JSA, they end up messing with his personal timeline, and COMPLETELY ERASE EVERYTHING I JUST TALKED ABOUT. Yeah. So why did I mention any of it? To demonstrate both that Degaton has a ridiculously complicated history, and that time-travel based characters in comic books have some of the craziest paradoxes. This show...this show is gonna be interesting. Anyway, Degaton's duplicate survives, and ends up traveling to the Modern Age (1980s, pre and post-crisis). He steals missiles from the Cuban Missile Crisis, and tries to blackmail Earth-2 into iving him control over it. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that he has a way to travel between Earth-1 and Earth-2. Oh, yeah. You see why this character would be AMAZING for this show? He's again defeated by several heroes, like he ALWAYS is. And he's frustrated about that, so he decides to visit each of the heroes of the newest JSA in their final moments, just so he could see them suffer. He later visits these heroes to torment them, giving them hints about their final moments. That understandably messes up the JSA. He doesn't stop there, as he proceeds to mess up their lives by killing the relatives of Stargirl, making the break-up of the JSA in the 1950s permanent by framing them all as traitors. This also erases all superheroes from history after this point. He is then stopped by a time-traveling JSA, who were not affected by the changes because they were outside of the time-stream. Atom-Smasher then proceeds to BEAT THE EVER-LIVING HELL out of Degaton, and his deeds are undone. However, he still survives, and proceeds to watch his enemies' deaths for his own enjoyments. And before anyone else says this...yes...he's basically an evil Doctor. He's a villainous Time-Lord. And THAT, above EVERYTHING ELSE, is why he'd be a PERFECT VILLAIN for this series. You have NO IDEA how excited I was when Rip said his name. If he's in the second season as the main villain...I will be overjoyed. Well...I've talked far too much about him. Sorry. Shall we move on to something takes up more than 2 seconds in the episode?

* Rip Hunter (and I'll get to him) works for the **Time Masters**, who...aren't really a thing in DC. Well, not like that, anyway. Let me explain. Rip Hunter in the comics is an independent inventor, who creates the Time Sphere. He recruits a group of people to travel through time with him and fight the forces of evil throughout time. And those people are called...[the Time Masters](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/7183-2032-7874-1-rip-hunter---time-.jpg). Alongside friend Jeff Smith, girlfriend Bonnie Baxter, and her...little brother...Corky...it's...it's the Fantastic Four. IT'S THE TIME-TRAVELLING, POWERLESS FANTASTIC FOUR. Not entirely sure why I hadn't caught that until now. Way to rip off Marvel, DC. Anyway, introduced in 1959...wait...1959? The Fantastic Four debuted in 1961...which means...Marvel ripped DC off? I...I gotta look into this, guys, hold on. (checks internet) Guys...nobody else has noticed this. HOW AM I THE FIRST ONE TO HAVE NOTICED THIS. Just...huh. You know, I don't really have much more to say about the Time Masters, but...wow. Didn't expect that revelation today...

* And now for the only main character not previously intriduced in other shows: **Rip Hunter, Time Master**. Now, I haven't really covered him on an FTCN before in detail, but this isn't the first time I've detailed his history. And so, I'm gonna say now what I said then: hang on. This might be a long, weirdly complicated one. First appearing as a side-story hero in 1959's [*Showcase* #20](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/a/a0/Showcase_20.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20071214172230) (and yes...that cover's real and AMAZING...), Rip Hunter is a time-traveler, who invented his own time machine, known as the Time-Sphere. He's also not an easy character to talk about, as his character constantly changes as a result of his time-traveling (and inconsistent writing over the years). But, some things remain constant. For example, he's always human. His time-travel abilities come from his machine, the Time-Sphere (a version of which appeared in *The Flash*). Hunter was a normal guy who went time-traveling with his compatriots, the Time Masters, a term that was eventually applied to him as a nickname. He'd go around fighting evil through time, and all that good stuff. This team eventually retired (due to being magically aged by a golden pyramid; you know, normal stuff), and Hunter was de-aged and recruited by the Immortal Man to become a part of his team, the Forgotten Heroes. I'll get to them later, I promise. During the multiverse event *Crisis of Infinite Earths* in 1985 (after which the entire DC Universe was rewritten, and the Multiverse was erased), Rip and the Forgotten heroes fought against the Anti-Monitor, a universe-devouring threat. Yes, that's right. Universe-devouring. If you want a good read, check it out. After the *Crisis* destroyed and rewrote the universe, everyone's history changed. Except for Hunter. As someone outside of time, he was the one of the only ones who remembered the original universe. However, no one remembered him, not even his old teammates in the Forgotten Heroes (IRONY). Additionally, there was now ANOTHER Rip Hunter running around, one that was part of the new universe. The original Rip Hunter joined a group of time-masters called the Linear Men, in an attempt to get back to his own time. He finally did it, but essentially broke time in the process. This erased him and the Linear Men from existence, and left the Post-*Crisis* Rip Hunter around. However, breaking time also let some characters erased during the original *Crisis* back into our world. And that...that was bad for the universe. They caused the SECOND Crisis, *Infinite Crisis*. And that recreated the Multiverse, and killed a BUNCH of people. But that's another, LONG story. Either way, Rip Hunter did it. As for the other, Post-*Crisis* Rip Hunter... 

* **Post-Crisis Rip Hunter** did pretty generic time-travel stuff for a while. Fought villains, fixed damage to the time-stream, all that good Doctor Who-eqsue stuff. He becomes a frequent collaborator with fellow time-traveling hero Booster Gold, who (and I'm putting this in spoiler tags JUST in case...) [is another time-travelling 21st century hero](#s ""who turns out to be Rip's father.""). This Hunter is also WAY more crueler than the original, torturing those who would pervert time, and protecting the time stream at ALL costs. Additionally, ""Rip Hunter"" is not his real name, but an alias to prevent time-travelling villains from finding him and killing him as a baby. He wasn't TOO notable until a THIRD crisis, *Final Crisis*. In that Crisis, [and this is a ***SPOILER***, for the record](#s ""*Batman is killed by Darkseid.*""). Well...sort of. Darkseid actually sends his consciousness through time (because comics books: they reject your reality and substitute their own.) in the series *Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne*. Hunter, alongside Booster Gold, Superman, and Green Lantern, travel through time to try and find Batman somewhere in history. And, eventually, they do. And that's the last time anyone cared about Rip Hunter. Basically. Long story short, Rip Hunter is basically the Doctor Who of DC Comics. Except he's not an alien, he travels in a Time Sphere instead of a police box, and he usually travels alone (now, anyway). As for his team...well, hold on a bit for that, if you would.

* Now, let's talk about **Rip Hunter's ship, Waverider**. I've already mentioned his classic ship, the Time-Sphere. That ship appeared in *The Flash* previously, and will probably appear again, somehow. But I'm not really talking about his ship in this bullet point (and his ship IS COOL, don't get me wrong). I'm talking about it's name: Waverider. Because that's a reference to two DC Comics characters, and one VERY RECENT REVELATION in comics. To talk about Waverider, we have to go to [an alternate future](https://d1466nnw0ex81e.cloudfront.net/n_iv/600/914475.jpg) in the year 2030. There, the villain [Monarch](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/0/40/140977-5402-monarch.jpg) (not [that one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz4PdpfI7zY)) has taken over the world, much to the dismay of scientist Matthew Ryder. Wanting to fight back, Ryder invents a time machine to go back in time and find the past Monarch, who was once a superhero in the 20th century (the identity of the Monarch is not something I'll reveal here, but it's a great example of early comic book leaks; someone revealed this plot point early, and caused DC to completely revise their plans, for the worse; if you're curious, feel free to ask). However, his machine had some technical difficltires, and in the process of time-travelling, he became merged with the time-stream. Thus he became the (admittedly very Silver Surfer-like) [Waverider](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/b/b7/Waverider_01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091023170910), gaining the ability to time-travel at will, fly at lightspeed, fire energy blasts, and predict the future of anyone he came into contact with. After defeating the Monarch with the help of the heroes of the past, Waverider met himself, pre-superpowers, through the time-stream. This was a version of him from the now-reset future, which is why they didn't erase each other via temporal paradox, and all that wibble wobbly timey wimey jibbery-joo. The two of them decided to work together to protect the time-stream by fixing time-paradoxes (hmmmmmm...that sounds familiar...). They formed the team called [the Linear Men](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/4/4d/Linear_Men_001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100406070034), which also included the previously discussed Rip Hunter. Waverider would later return to help Superman fight the resurrected Doomsday, who had already ""killed him"" at that point. They took him to the end of time, and all was good...until Waverider was killed by a resurrected Monarch (now called Extant). However, an untransformed Matthew Ryder was still alive, and was fated to become Waverider to preserve the time-stream. He then helped to create a new Big Bang. Yeah, I'm not going into the events that led to that. And again, all was good for a while...until [he was killed again by Skeets in *52*.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rGG2VfQRWew/VQAxcSuZqAI/AAAAAAAAW_Q/H6UKbE6J2uY/s1600/27.JPG) Who's Skeets? ...I'll get to that. Let's just say that he's SO EVIL, that he actually skinned Waverider, and wore his skin. Geez. That wasn't the end of Waverider, though. Yeah, that sounds impossible, but hear me out. Travelling through time, the villain known as [Black Beetle finds Waverider's skin](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W6GXxw1amPs/TckUunrcmkI/AAAAAAAABMs/dwfNl7hRQn8/s1600/bbeetle+linear+men.jpg), planning to use it to gain his powers. But he's stopped, and the skin instead fuses with Liri Lee, one of the Linear Men. She becomes [Linear Woman](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/55747/2154634-linear_men___liri_lee_2.jpg), taking over Waverider's position. And then...I don't know, actually. She just disappears from all comic books, and NOT because of the reboot. And that brings me to the OTHER reference that this whole thing implies...

* OK, this is a spoiler. A HUGE spoiler, both for the comic books, and potentially for the show. I'd put this whol bullet point in spoiler tags, but I can't get pictures in the article if I do that. And so, Im just gonna tell you to stop reading right here by doing this: ***SPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERSSPOILERS***. Good? Now...Booster Gold, time-travelling superhero, is Rip Hunter's father. In the VERY recent DC event [*Convergence*](http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2015/05/bgoldconv-cv1-ds-137121.jpg) (which, surprise surprise, is one of the few New 52 affiliated events that I legitimately enjoyed), it's revealed that Booster Gold (from the pre-New 52 universe) is dying. Working [with his sister](http://www.boosterrific.com/pics/comics/panels/bfe101_17.jpg), [his son from the future](http://i.newsarama.com/images/i/000/143/923/original/10-BoosterGold-COLOR_580_547d0b0fe27059.83764469.jpg?1424703932), and his New-52 incarnation, Booster attempts to save himself and the time stream, while dealing with the over-arching events of the comic. And in the process, Booster is healed...and [something happens that I legitimately didn't expect.](http://insidepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Convergence-Booster-Gold-2-spoilers-7.jpg) Booster Gold...becomes Waverider. Yeah. Booster Gold, THE FATHER OF RIP HUNTER, becomes Waverider. And now, you might understand how excited I was when the name of the ship was revealed. Now...this may not have been planned, and the WHOLE THING may be a huge coincidence...but I'm not sure I believe that, honestly. So, what am I saying? I'm saying that we very well might see Booster Gold in this series. And, OK, [the show producers have denied that](http://screencrush.com/legends-of-tomorrow-booster-gold-jay-jackson/), but I CAN DREAM!!! Plus, I rarely believe show producers with that kind of stuff. Only...time...will tell, I suppose.

* I'm not going to go into **each of our various team members** here, as I have a lot more to talk about in this post. I may write a separate post just to catch you all up on these characters, in case you've never seen them before. So, in the meantime...

* ...let's talk about **Carter and Kendra's relationship** a little. Yeah, OK, I've also talked about this in a previous recap, but there's one specific aspet that needs to be discussed: Kendra's memory loss. In the comics, Kendra Saunders' origin is what does not allow her to remember her past lives, whilst Carter Hall remembers all of it. Specifically, Kendra Saunders WAS a young woman who had sadly committed suicide, and was immediately possessed by the soul of her aunt, Shiera Saunders, and the most recent Hawkgirl (calling herself Hawkwoman, actually). Saunders lived, but with her OWN memories, rather than the memories of Shiera or priestess Chay-Ara. So, yes, that is actually a reference to Kenda Saunders' comic book incarnation. It's small, but I appreciate that. She'll probably end up regaining her memories completely in the show, which the comic book version of Kendra only did after she DIED, and was resurrected. Of course, at that point, Kendra herself essentially ceased to be. So, if Kendra regains all of her memories in the show...will there be a Kendra anymore?

* When we first see the Hawks, and when we go back to the '70s, we go to **the city of St. Roch** in...the city of New Orleans? Wait, what? Huh. Let me explain. This is a fusion of the DC Comics city, a New Orleans-like city located in Louisiana, and the [REAL St. Roch](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/StRochsCampoSantoArch.jpg), a neighborhood within New Orleans. I won't go into the real St. Roch here (although  might visit for nerdy reasons someday), but I'll talk a bit about the comic book version. In the comic books, St. Roch, once known as La Moyne, was a city plagued by ywllow fever and rats. It was cured by a travelling priest, Saint Roch, and the city was renamed in his honor. Then, in the 19th century, western heroes [Nighthawk and Cinnamon](http://www.theouthousers.com/images/jck//ThanosCopter/NightCinn.jpg). And if you've read my FTCNs before, you may remember that they are reincarnations of Khufu and Chay-Ara. In fact, a number of reincarnations of the Hawks have lived in St. Roch since then, essentially making that their homebase. And as this episode (and the show, let's be honest) is heavily focused on the Hawk's mythology, it's nice to see pieces of the city realized for the first time.

* ...You know, the LAST person I expected that Boba Fett bounty hunter to be was **Chronos**. Why? Because [THIS is Chronos!](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/5/5d/Chronos_0001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091116070454). Yeah. Talk about a loose adaptation. I'm not gonna go intro detail with Chronos here, because...I dunno, I'm not really convinced that this is really him! I'll go into a little, though. David Clinton was a petty thief who had very good timing. Yeah. He was a villain, and really the archenemy, of the Atom, Ray Palmer. And this wouldn't seem like a threatening guy, UNTIL he got his hands on technology that allowed him to manipulate time and time travel, essentially making him a master of time. However, at the end of the day, the vast majority of his time-based schemes involved doing something only for his own personal gain, rather than Per Degaton level goals. He's not the only Chronos, but he is the most notable. Again, I'll go into him once we learn more about him. And if we don't learn more about him...I'll figure something out. But figuring that he is a pretty major villain of the Atom, and he Atom is a main character in this series...I'm expecting great things from this character, despite the weirdness of this adaptation.

* Huh. Did not see that one coming. So, Aldus is **the son of Hawkman and Hawkgirl.* In the comics, the Hawks have one biological son: Hector Hall. And, yeah, Hector has NOTHING to do with Aldus, but...I dunno, maybe they had another son after Aldus. It's absolutely possible. In the comics, Hector has attempted to take up his parent's superhero legacy in multiple ways. First, he was the [Silver Scarab](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/3/3a/Silver_Scarab_Hector_Hall_002.png/revision/latest?cb=20120103183113), then the [Sandman](http://www.writeups.org/img/fiche/5313.jpg), and then [Doctor Fate](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/hawkman/images/9/9c/Doctor_Fate_Hector_Hall.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100829005500). His son, Daniel, eventually became the character [Dream](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/c/c9/Daniel_Hall_001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080322180543), and I am NOT going into that right now. Will we see another son of the Hawks later down the line? Well, I wouldn't be opposed to it!

* So, it's all a lie. These ""heroes"" are meant to be ""forgotten,"" huh? OK, this is in NO WAY referenced directly, but...I got a hunch. This series, and the ""Legends of Tomorrow"" team may actually have another name: **the Forgotten Heroes**. You may remember from earlier in this article that I mentioned that Rip Hunter joined another team: the Forgotten Heroes. The Forgotten heroes were called that because, in the real world, they had pretty much vanished from comic books for one reason or another. Created by the Klarn the Immortal Man (guess what his powers are?), the team included: [Animal Man](http://www.classicmarvelforever.com/cms/assets/images/profiles/comic_book/Animal_Man.jpg), who harnessed the powers of the animal kingdom; former spelunker [Calvin ""Cave"" Carson](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/Cavecarsondcu0.jpg); giant golden gorlla [Congorilla](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/6/6a/Congorilla_003.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090713222739); amnesiac underwater vixen [Dolphin](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/2/2e/Dolphin_001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100503020724); Sea Devil [Dane Dorrance](http://www.comicbookreligion.com/img/d/a/Dane_Dorrance_4.jpg); army man and Suicide Squad leader [Rick Flag, Jr.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111113706/4689225-4221028915-Rick-.jpg); and, of course, Rip Hunter. And they were brought together by the Immortal Man to fight his immortal enemy...[Vandal Savage](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/0/05/Vandal_Savage_0003.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100511032017). See the connection now? The heroes of our show (and they aren't all heroes, I know) may not truly be forgotten by the season's end, but the theme certainly isn't lost on me.

* And FINALLY, let's talk about Vandal Savage, the big bad of the episode. I've already talked about Savage in a previous episode FTCN, so I'll simply repeat that dialogue here. First appearing as a villain of Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern...you know what? No. We're doing this right. Let's start at the beginning; 50,000 years ago, to be exact. Vandar Adg was a Cro-Magnon Man, and leader of the vicious Blood Tribe. One fateful night, a mysterious meteor crashed to the ground (because OF COURSE it did), and it was found by Vandar. He was bathed in radiation, and granted intellect and immortality. The same meteor would also create his enemy, a member of the rival Bear Tribe. This other immortal man would become known as...[the Immortal Man](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/0/00/Immortal_Man_001.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080815184652). Immortal, not creative. Vandar became a great and terrible leader on his people, gaining powe throughout history. The first thing he did was destroy a large and ancient civilization, plunging it into legend. You know this city as Atlantis. Oh, yeah, Atlantis was a HUGE thing in the DC Universe. But let's not get into that now. Vandar Adg changed his name to Vandal Savage, and made MANY marks on history. He has laimed to have been Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Jack the Ripper, and Vlad the Impaler (the vampire crack that Cisco made mayhave been a reference to this). He also served as the advisor to Erik the Red, Napoleon, Ra's al Ghul, Otto van Bismarck, and HITLER. He became an enemy of the Justice Society during World War II, and the Justice League in the present. You name a hero, they've probably fought him in one way or another. He's had THOUSANDS of children (including his daughter in the modern day, [Scandal Savage](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/batman/images/d/d0/Scandal_Savage.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120729020712)), and his inluence on history wil never be equaled. What I'm saying is, the guy's pretty awesome. And I am THRILLED to see him in this series. But he's never been truly magic in the comics, although he definitely has some affiliation with magic in the DC Universe. Plus, he's also been worshipped as a god once or twice. DUring *Final Crisis*, it was revealed that the Church of Crime worshipped him as their ancient god...Cain. Oh, yeah, THAT Cain. First murderer Cain. After being stabbed by the mythological Spear of Destiny, Cain was reborn in Vandal's body. As Cain, Vandal enslaved the Spectre. Oh, yeah, he enslaved a SERVANT OF THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN GOD, and the SPIRIT ON VENGEANCE. Just...Savage is awesome, guys. But, after *Final Crisis* (and after he was defeated, because OF COURSE he was), he didn't appear too much more. He did appear briefly, showing that Savage has now been cursed by the biblical Mark of Cain, which he yearns to be free of. He has appeared in the New 52 in various times. He fought Etrigan and his team in medieval England, then met Jonah Hex in 1800s Gotham City, and is now a member of the Secret Society of Super-Villains, in a high-ranking position. I don't know what the future holds for him, but I know this much: he'll be alive...and we'll be dead. Morbidity aside, I love Savage, and I can't wait for more of him!

____________________________________

And that's it for now, everybody! This was a long one, as expected. I'm looking forward to next week's continuation of the pilot, and the various adventures through time that this show will present. We'll be seeing Jonah Hex at some point (I AM SO EXCITED TO WRITE THAT RECAPYOUHAVENOIDEA), and we *might* see the Legion of Super-Heroes (if that happens, I may cry from sheer, unadulterated joy). There's no telling what the future holds, but I guess that's why this show has a time machine in it. See you next time, Legends lovers!

Villain,"This should clear up concerns of who the villain is: 
Okay, I'll presume everyone's seen the new Suicide Squad trailer? If not, it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmRih_VtVAs

Of note is the fact The Joker doesn't seem to be the real villain, as some previously assumed. 

I invite you to stare at it paused at points where the villain appears (although not clearly) and you can see evidence of his devastation (1:07, 1:13)

Lets look at possible culprits, offered by various journalists (who are morons who no nothing of the DCU);

THE TATTOOED MAN

BRAINIAC

Firstly, the tattooed man does appear to be in the film, portrayed by some rapper or something. And at first glance he seems to be a reasonable suspect. He is bald, he is capable of firing dark projectiles (possibly in a tentacle like appendage). HOWEVER it appears who ever or what ever the real villain is can alter/control others (see: terror soldiers that deadshot fires at 1:48) and appears to have some form of golden and green regalia (see: Subway scenes 1:44 and 1:51) which just doesn't make sense for him. Lastly I think that whatever this is is powerful, not ordinary super level, I mean powerful... Magical (and my suspect will address this).

Brainiac? No. No. Dear god no. Jesus H Christ why? No.

Allow me to explain: Yes, brainiac having tentacle appendages is a reasonable interpretation. Yes, brainiac having altered terror soliders is a reasonable interpretation. Yes, brainiac being/possessing a bald man is a reasonable interpretation. Yes, brainiac having the power to waste half of Central City is a reasonable interpretation. HOWEVER and I mean HOWEVER it would be a waste of potential and wouldn't fit the rest of the (admittedly more circumstantial) evidence.

And so... I invite you to look upon the name of my culprit:

HERMES TRISMEGISTUS, FATHER OF HERMETICISM 

""WHO!?!"" I hear you cry? Please, allow me to explain.

Hermes Trismegistus is a Pseudo-Greek/Egyptian writer and possibly magical entity. Who has appeared in the DCU before, with ENCHANTRESS, specifically in the DAY OF JUDGEMENT story arch where she met ""a succubus working with a group of Mafia-styled demons to resurrect Hermes Trismegestus"".

So, Black Adam and Wonder Woman is in this DCU film adaptation, so Egyptian and Greek magic CHECK 

The latter subway scene shows a very pharaoh like headdress and armour on our culprit, so again CHECK

Resurrection magic with demons and shit? 2:03=CHECK

A terrifying magical entity that may be predicted by enchantress and so would be reasonable for her to turn up in the white house (1:27) and warn the US government to subsequently form a Team (or Squad) to go on a Suicide mission to stop this entity, making sense how the team was readily assembled and primed before the massive destruction of a major US city?

Need some help regarding Batman comics.,"I'd like to introduce my slightly younger cousin to some comics (13), and he's interested in Batman. Now, I've read some Batman storylines,  (DKR, The Long Halloween) but I've never really read any of the original Batman series, as I prefer characters like Green Arrow, Green Lantern, Teen Titans and Suicide Squad. Any of the original run I should keep him away from? What's the darkest in there? I'm not willing to individually read up about each issue on the internet.

Kevin Hanchard in Suicide Squad?,"So, as a fan of the show Orphan Black, I eventually stumbled upon Kevin Hanchard's (one of the main actors in Orphan Black) IMDb page, and as I browsed his filmography, I noticed it has him listed as ""Casino Boss.""

Out of curiosity, I Googled that various times, but I never found a source of that casting. There does seem to be a casino scene (there's a shot in the trailer of Harley in what appears to be a casino), but I just found it odd that they'd cast a moderately big name for what sounds like a very small role.

Suicide Squad trailer is awesome (Even though it's tagline is very cheesy),"So the Suicide Squad trailer was released a couple of days ago and i liked alot. looks like DC/WB are going to inject a little bit more fun to a cinematic universe that's wants to be dark and serious in tone, and let me tell you it's twisted and weird as i hope it would be. Margot robbie's comedic moments work. The Joker looks Chaotic and fun, and the idea that Jared Leto is bringing something to the character of the Joker that we've never seen Before, we are going to have a Joker that looks like really loves being this person he enjoys every fucking minute and that's one of the element that this film has going for.


One of the Biggest surprises of this trailer is how Colorful it is, how well shot the movie looks the cinematography is great. the choice of Bohemian Rasphody by Queen is amazing and bring a twisted feel to the trailer. We get alot of new footage of all the characters, Like Enchantress (that visually looks creepy) and that brings an important thing. One thing that is the best thing that this trailer could have done 
is that it looks like DC/WB is embracing weirdness and magical elements. Something they are doing for Wonder Woman too.

But the biggest surprise of the trailer is Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang. Jai Courtney is a very infamous figure in the film World for some Film fans due to his ""Wooden Acting"" in movies like 'Terminator: Genysis' and 'A Good Day To Die Hard'. but the reason that this trailer convinces me that his performance in this movie is going to be awesome is that he looks like he's having fun in the movie, And i know that's not a reassuring answer but honestly looks like he's doing a character that really suits him well (Captain Boomerang being a Drunk anti-hero)

It's 4:30 am... I've been celebrating and reading and watching... I'm upset at you guys and I'm honest...,"Demarcus had an incredible night. WCS has show to be exactly what we wanted. We turned a possible HOF turned deadbeat/washup into a hero and restored his career. Mclemore has shown he deserves to be here and has shown that he is a force within himself. Omri stepped up tonight and played against the best SF in the Eastern conference. Bellinelli is trash so fuck it. With all these we are still missing three big points and we all need to see this as a community, family, sub, and SACRAMENTO KINGS FANS....

1. GEORGE MOTHERFUCKING KARL!!! I know some cry about malone... and the minutes players get.... he has turned our shit team into a suicide squad that has the potential of a huge 6-5th seed upset. Remember that he is a small ball coach with a I'll tempered all star center and he has turned that into hope... Don't believe me? Look at fucking Cousins smirk while giving a humble interview. He is fucking happy... we almost lost the best thing to happen to the cowbell kingdom because we had shit owners and we were overzealous to expect a brand new owner not to make mistakes.. next point...

2. Vivek has been nothing but a god send... he saved our city... saved our arena... gave us hope... but crushed it because just like a high school freshman... he just wanted to prove himself... to the NBA? no.... to Sacramento. I reme.ber leaving work early because I heard we traded for Rudy Gay and I just freaked the fuck out. He made impressive moves but I still read comments and articles that he was an idiot.... WRONG! He was Naive... why do I love this guy? Because he knew that he tried but wasn't capable of making it happen and brought in the Vlade father. A man who spent millions to accept that he cannot do it on his own is a man that deserves just as much praise as Demarcus does for a 48 win streak. Don't agree? Fuck you.

3. Lastly.... as a 9 year season ticket holder.
 (2001-2005, 2011-2016) this has been the most exciting and liberating basketball I have seen in the city I was raised in for over a decade. No drama, no Bullshit... just hustle ball. This is the first season where I paid for a seat but I can't fucking sit down. That isn't a complaint. We aren't a championship but if you fucking can't see that we can be in a few years.... go buy a Curry jersey... every sports apparel store sells it but good luck finding Kings gear unless it's the Kings store... THIS IS IN FUCKING SACTOWN!!!!

Celebrate this.. believe what you are feeling because it's real. Enjoy the hype... most of use haven't had this and some of us haven't had it in 10 years... but do not act like it's because of pure talent... well it is. A HOF Coach, An incredible Kings HOF Vlade and an amazing fan base.

No more Malone BS... No more trade Gay BS. No more negative BS

VA question," So, Backstory - OIF vet, ets'd in 2011. I had deployed to Iraq, no CAB, however saw combat just we were away from our parent unit and never got a CAB because of shitty leaders. A bunch of other shit happened in the military - sexually assaulted as well(never reported, as a male...would you?)

Been in an out of jobs, depression and anxiety since I got out of the service. Was very isolated and contemplated suicide. Moving along, I decided in october perhaps joining the guard my life would get stabilized. Upon reconnecting with vets I realized I should of claimed some sort of VA stuff when I was getting out. Since I was ignorant I didn't. 

So monday I'm going to start the claim process. Most of the guys I was with on my deployment got 70%+. Do you think the fact that I joined the guard the VA will think I'm full of shit? My life outside of the military has been tumultuous at best, and my team mates and squad mates all have PTSD ratings. I also have back issues as well which were documented in service. 

The only thing available in my city is a VA outreach clinic. ",Veterans,9,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/42eb0a/va_question/,,disgruntvet,42eb0a,/r/Veterans/comments/42eb0a/va_question/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/42eb0a/va_question/,8,2016-01-24

Different DCEU genre films.,"Do you think DCEU should do what Marvel does and give each film their own template, a genre? Or make them all epic or epic and different genres as well?

MoS was kind of a scifi film that Zack Snyder himself said wanted it to be. BvS I'm not sure. Some kind of idealogical thriller? Suicide Squad is going to be a Dirty Dozen kind of a movie. Wonder Woman is a period drama. Justice League is going to be this epic movie.

Aquaman I think is going to be a Game of Thrones style movie. Flash is gonna focus on time-traveling. Justice league 2 is going to follow the first JL by being epic. Shazam is at least a comedy. GLC is hinted at being a buddy-cop movie with Hal and John.

Thoughts on possible antagonist(s) for Suicide Squad?,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD AND IN COMMENTS!!!***

We know Joker isn't on the team, but that doesn't confirm he is an antagonist or the 'big bad. 

Rumor had it that it would Enchantress going rogue and is strengthened by the fact she is in little footage with the rest o f the squad, seen in the white house (could really be nothing). The weird train monster, deformed humanoids the squad fights in that office area, and the mini-tornado thing in what looked like a train station all clearly have some magic involved so I think it could be Enchantress.

Also, the previously mentioned monsters and such could be the work of the Tattooed man, rumored to be played by Common based on leaked set pics. One split second shot of the train monster looks like a human is at the center of the monster as it tears through the train, and many claim it looks like Common.

TL;DR Could be Joker, Enchantress, or Tattooed Man. Or the possibility its someone we haven't seen yet.",DC_Cinematic,1,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/42iacr/thoughts_on_possible_antagonists_for_suicide_squad/,DISCUSSION,Prometheus237,42iacr,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/42iacr/thoughts_on_possible_antagonists_for_suicide_squad/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/42iacr/thoughts_on_possible_antagonists_for_suicide_squad/,7,2016-01-24

Who else thinks that FNV is a million times better than FO4? Warning: Rant,"Roleplaying is dead in FO4 for me, in New Vegas I roleplayed a shitload of characters such as:

    One of the only Enclave Remnants alive looking for other survivors

    An Enclave Remnant with ""For the enclave"" installed with a vertibird pickup, enclave soldiers to protect me and an enclave base to top it off

    A random survivor whos home is an nonoperational crashed tank

    A junkie thats willing to steal, rob or kill for his next fix

    A 10 year old kid and his sister that survived the attack on their barbaric village and now they go around with Brahmin skull masks and blunt objects to kill giant rats, mole rats, and homeless people to eat.

    A special operative that got separated from his squad

    A Roman Spartan that got zapped into the Fallout Universe and he thinks nothing is wrong, he thinks Caesars Legion is the Roman Empire

And the list goes on. My point is theres so much roleplaying in FNV but nearly none at all in FO4, mainly due to the dialogue. Oh god the dialogue.

What the fuck is with the dialogue now? In FNV if you had enough Science, barter, speech, specific perks, low intelligence etc. you could say a million different things, and now it has the speech of the walking dead game or Mass Effect, Yes, No, Maybe, Sarcastic Yes, gimme monie, which is always 100 caps ffs.

And Power Armor is just utterly ruined for me in FO4 as well, it used to be a thing to look up to, like: ""Wow, I wanna be like that guy!"" Then you go half the game in FNV looking for some veteran rangers to murder, find out they only spawn later in the game, level up enough, murder a BoS paladin for that sweet armor annnd... Power armor training. After all this hassle... It's sooo worth it, you feel like a goddamn god, you might not be one but you feel immensely badass finally wearing what you've looked up to for so long.

But in Fallout 4 you get that shit so damn quick, and then for some reason fight a deathclaw right after? What the fuck?

Also I'm pretty sure everybody here agrees that prestons missions are all repetitive bullshit about settlements and blah blah blah, go kill this, collect that, blah blah blee blah.

I guess the game is pretty cool if you've never played another Fallout game, it's not even an RPG anymore, it's just a shooter aside from the creating your own town thing, which I didn't even give a shit about after like 2 hours, I didn't buy Fallout 4 just to play fucking Sim City without the alien invasions and shit.

And the voice actor (At least the male one) sounds like hes on fucking suicide watch, like hes swallowing his anti-depressants as hes recording the voice, I mean sometimes he has a bit of pep in his step but usually hes just a fucking potato sack squeezing the smallest amount of air out of his system to record these lines.

Again, if you've never played Fallout 1, 2, or New Vegas you'll probably love it, but I don't think anybody can really defend this dumbed down game.

I know I harshly just criticized Fallout 4, ON the Fallout subreddit and I'll probably get crucified but to be honest, I don't HATE Fallout 4, I just think it's massively disappointing to actual Fallout fans that the game turned out to be like this. But there are some good things about it like the V.A.T.S system is a bit nerfed which is good because it was a fucking mess in Fallout 3 and NV and trying to play without it makes you realize how shit the combat is, so good job on this one FO4.

Overall though I'd give this game a 3/10, I tried SOOOOO hard to love it but I can't, 40 hours of gameplay later and I can't even bare to start the fucking thing, I know there's gonna be people who agree with me and some people that just joined Caesars Legion so they have the chance to crucify me but either way I wanna hear your opinions in the comments, hostile or passive.

Which Voyager crew members would and would not be arrested upon their arrival to Earth?,"Or to put things another way, for whom would the Nuremberg defence be sustained?

I know this is a topic that many don't like taking about for whatever reason, but as someone who spent time in the RCN it always rubbed me the wrong way that Janeway and the crew not only got no punishment for their many crimes but got promotions beyond what was reasonable (Janeway becoming a Vice Admiral was hard to believe given it was a triple promotion after 7 years of command). In the real world many, potentially all, of the crew would have faced some form of prison sentences even if many of their actions where written off as circumstance permitting. A few examples are as such:

**Murder in the first degree**

Prison sentence unavoidable: Janeway, Equinox crew

Prison sentence possible: remaining Voyager crew

Morality: debatable

Legality: unambiguously criminal

Sentence range: 25 to life

The actions of the Equinox crew are fairly well defined as being murder, and they are aware they shall be prosecuted for their crimes if they reach home, so there's no real need to discuss that here. However Tuvix is a situation that is far less discussed or mentioned in the series. While one could argue about the morality (or even pragmatism) of his murder, the legality is fairly rigid. A sapient individual had his existence terminated for no wrong on his part against his will. The closest real world analogues situation would be mercy killings, which, outside of a few areas which have legalized ""death with dignity"" laws of medical assisted suicide, such actions are nearly universally considered murder, and that is in situations where one is doing the action to end suffering, often with the consent of the person being killed.

While the Federation is likely to be a nation in which doctor assisted suicide is legal, it is unlikely they would view the killing of a sapient individual against their will as something that would be given free pass given the circumstances. Janeway would have no realistic chance of winning such a case, and due to the assistance and bystander syndrome of most of the crew there is a possibility many would be charged with assisted homicide. Frankly, Tuvok, Echeb, the Doctor, Seven and Naomi are the only ones on the ship who don't have any risk of prosecution for this one.

**Torture**

Prison sentence unavoidable: Janeway

Morality: unjustifiable

Legality: unambiguously criminal

Sentence range: 15-25 years

This crime only applies to Janeway as she is the only one who committed it, and only avoids being another count of first degree murder due to the intervention of Chakotay. In part 2 of Equinox the actions she did against Crewmen Noah Lessing constitutes torture and may even be argued as legally attempted murder (it did only avoid being murder in the first degree due to Chakotay after all).

**Treason**

Prison sentence unavoidable: Janeway, Chakotay

Prison sentence avoidable: remainder of Voyager crew

Morality: unjustifiable

Legality: unambiguously criminal

Sentence range: life without parole in peace time, death by firing squad in wartime

The Borg and Species 8172 have an odd relationship with Voyager. In the first encounter with Species 8172 Voyager does at least one and possible a second act of treason in the two party Scorpio by aiding the Borg, an entity with with the Federation is in a state of war with, in fighting 8172, a species who through proper diplomacy could have been made into the single greatest ally the Federation ever had. Instead Voyager joins forces with the Borg to fight them, an act which set 8172 into an active state of war with the Federation, and led to at least one species being exterminated as a direct result of their actions, with untold millions or billions potentially also being assimilated as a direct result, potentially putting the Federation in an unknowing state of war with Delta and fringe Beta Quadrant powers viewing Voyagers actions as representative of the Federation (and likely doing enough damage for them not to care).

On top of that a second (potentially third) act of treason was committed by her when, in a war Janeway started, she gave over classified Federation military technology to an enemy in wartime as part of a treaty she had no sanctioning in signing, had no ability to enforce or even monitor its adherence, and did so solely on the words of people who had no reason to be trusted due to how they 
had no reason to trust Janeway.

While it is incredibly arguable as to whether the ""only following orders"" Nurenburg defence would work for most of the crew, in the case of Janeway and Chakotay it's a pretty open and shut case, with the real argument being whether the acts would be treated as having been committed in peace time or wartime.

**Terrorism**

Prison sentence avoidable: surviving Maquis crew

Morality: debatable

Legality: varied, pardon possible

Sentence range: various, possibly none

This one is worth mentioning, though it was actually dealt with in the series unlike the others. Plus it is realistic to consider their actions over the course of the series to be both repayment and punishment in itself for their crimes, and when added to the fact their organization is long defunct by that point it is actually somewhat realistic that the outcome we saw would happen. Though I'd say a slap on the wrist would likely be more tame then would be realistic.

That's the most obvious and most egregious crimes committed by the crew of Voyager over the course of the series. I know I'm probably going to get a lot of downvotes for this, I felt as though getting this off my chest would do me good since it's something that has been urking me for a while.",DaystromInstitute,51,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/42jlkh/which_voyager_crew_members_would_and_would_not_be/,Discussion,Z_for_Zontar,42jlkh,/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/42jlkh/which_voyager_crew_members_would_and_would_not_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/42jlkh/which_voyager_crew_members_would_and_would_not_be/,99,2016-01-25

Suicide Squad Game Possibilities,"I was thinking about the ending of Arkham Origins and how Arkham Knight kindof killed any possibility of Batman encountering people like Deathstroke and Firefly after Origins took place. Obviously through in game dialogue like Garfield  saying ""You fought me once. But that was a long time ago.""  and Slade saying ""You did some damage, the first time we met. I'm looking forward to paying you back.""

So i thought what about instead of getting an ""Arkham Origins 2"" where you play as Batman and you go against the Suicide Squad, you actually play as the Suicide Squad. Slade, Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang etc. It would be really cool to play as a bunch of different characters and use their specific abilities. Any thoughts?",BatmanArkham,20,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BatmanArkham/comments/42jbcy/suicide_squad_game_possibilities/,,HT52,42jbcy,/r/BatmanArkham/comments/42jbcy/suicide_squad_game_possibilities/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BatmanArkham/comments/42jbcy/suicide_squad_game_possibilities/,19,2016-01-25
"I think I've solved the mystery of the ""Subway Creature"" (Suicide Squad)","Today I downloaded [u/NoImagination85's high bitrate version of the new Suicide Squad trailer](https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/41wc29/very_high_bitrate_version_of_suicide_squad/) and I noticed a few things.

I've seen people suggest the [""Subway Creature""](http://imgur.com/W6cYBK5) is Tattooed Man, Joker, Brainiac, Swamp Thing, Poison Ivy, Enchantress, some demon Enchantress summoned, and all kinds of other interesting possibilities. However, I now believe the Subway Creature is OMAC. Here's what Wikipedia has to say about OMACs:
&gt;The OMACs are cyborgs, human bodies transformed by a virus into living machines to assassinate any and all beings with superpowers. The virus was created from Brainiac-13's nanotechnology, which had been acquired by the U.S. Department of Defense and Lexcorp, and was then secretly introduced into general vaccine supplies.

So let's look at some evidence (if you can call it that):

- This Subway Creature seems to have [a](http://imgur.com/bBlPhrD) [prominent](http://imgur.com/8a09mPr) [mohawk](http://imgur.com/wuXGthu). OMAC also has a distinctive mohawk.

- It's very mechanical, so it can't be Poison Ivy or Swamp Thing. Tattooed Man's constructs aren't metallic, and that tentacle/vine thing the Subway Creature shoots out doesn't seem related to his powers at all. And since this movie seems to be emphasizing her magic-ness, Enchantress or some character related to her would be more magical or demonic than technological, as some other users have pointed out.

- OMACs are humans whose bodies have been ""taken over"" by a nano-virus. We see what appear to be [soldiers infected with something](http://imgur.com/iSBXeEt) fighting the Squad in the trailer. Some have suggested they could have been infected by Enchantress, but I believe the trailer has been misleading us on her role. Judging by the trailer, she appears to be a villain in the film, but Rick Flagg seems to list her among members of the already-formed squad, referring to her as ""you."" The Suicide Squad is already formed, and he's speaking to Enchantress. So they *probably* weren't formed against her. (I'm reaching a little here.) We also see implications of a relationship between her and Rick Flagg.

- In [this scene](http://imgur.com/MbjpE6m), we see... something. Upon [closer inspection](http://imgur.com/XvRxtDl), our ""something"" definitely appears more technological than magical. I've got no idea what [these things](http://imgur.com/UBwtwtq) standing around it are, though.

- As a matter of fact, I think there is plenty to suggest there is some hidden technological character in this film. In [this shot](http://imgur.com/yUpzZxI) of Harley jumping, that's a laser behind her. Not bullets. There are sparks and an explosion. Joker and Enchantress, or their minions, don't shoot lasers (as far as I know!).

- The Subway Monster launches out that tentacle-like appendage at the soldiers. [This](http://imgur.com/SLuezms) is the most interesting shot to me. First, we see the mohawk and we get a glimpse of the Creature's [face](http://imgur.com/dz8OgPH). And it looks suspiciously like Joker. *Maybe* Joker was infected with our nanovirus, but I don't think that makes much sense. Second, I noticed that the air around the Creature is definitely [swirling or distorted](http://imgur.com/hstTJNX). Like a force field. I'm not sure if OMAC has that power, but I did find this:
&gt;the OMAC unit can morph its extremities into blades and pincers.

So, we have an unidentified, metallic villain with a prominent mohawk and the ability to extend its appendages and possibly generate force fields. Also, there's a lot of unexplained weirdness in this trailer, from the infected soldiers to the lasers to the swirling nanobot-like stuff at the end. I really think OMAC, possibly created by Waller, Lexcorp, or even Brainiac, is our Subway Creature.

[Spoilers S3] So is ____ really dead?,"Deadshot? They made it somewhat clear that he blew up along with the building, but they never really declared it did they? It's possible he is still alive? He was one of my favorite characters throughout the seasons.

I read that it's a possible decision made by DC to kill off Deadshot in the show so they can re-introduce him in the Suicide Squad movie with Will Smith, but I refuse to think Deadshot didn't have a way out of that hellhole.",arrow,15,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/42omdl/spoilers_s3_so_is_really_dead/,,ILoveScottishLasses,42omdl,/r/arrow/comments/42omdl/spoilers_s3_so_is_really_dead/,https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/42omdl/spoilers_s3_so_is_really_dead/,17,2016-01-25

A Planet Named S'less,"OOC: First of all, let me explain this thing. So, the ship that had Sky crashed in 2555... And Sky arrived in the canyon in 2558. This leaves a three year gap between Sky crashing on a desert planet named S'less and Sky getting to the canyon. ""Oh, Sky, my good friend and senpai, what happened in those 3 years?"" I hear you asking... well... read this backstory thing... and stuff.

*In the year 2556, in a galaxy far, far away, the UNSC Vengeance (A ship specialized in cryo tubes and shit... you know, the one that had the 13 century idiot on it? Yeah, that's the one) crashed in the middle of the desert on the planet of S'less. Sky has looted white rogue armor with blue trims from a dead mercenary, and escaped the ship, trying to find a nearby settlement. The one thing he doesn't know is* ***[REDACTED]***. *The suspense intensifies.*

Is Harley stupid or is it just the Arkham series ?,"I always like harley although I have never read any comics or anything, she just seemed like a cool character. And now that she will be in suicide squad I decided to do some research. 

Now I know arkham games are just small portion of DC universe, but as I dont like comics very much and dont know where else is she featured, I watched her story in the arkham series. 

Question, is she stupid ? I always though she is crazy, manipulative and well, individualistic. But the way she is portrated in the games makes her look really dumb. What is her position in the DC universe ? I know she was a doctor and she got where she was through manipulation so I figured she acutally is smart. Maybe joker did something to her that made her, well, dumb ? I think she is the only character in DC universe that appeals to me and I would hate it if she was really that dumb as she is in the games.

Discussion: Batman v Superman Wave 2 Predictions?,"Nothing's been announced as far as I know but with so many characters I think it's a given. For starters:

Lex Luthor,
(6 inch?) Doomsday,
The Flash,
Cyborg,
Lois Lane (it's kind of criminal she hasn't had a Pop yet),
Alfred

Anyone else you'd like to see? I guess anything's possible with Superman Soldier making the cut

Does anybody feel that New Vegas is WAY better than Fallout 4?,"Roleplaying is dead in FO4 for me, in New Vegas I roleplayed a shitload of characters such as:

- One of the only Enclave Remnants alive looking for other survivors

- An Enclave Remnant with ""For the enclave"" installed with a vertibird pickup, enclave soldiers to protect me and an enclave base to top it off

- A random survivor whos home is an nonoperational crashed tank

- A junkie thats willing to steal, rob or kill for his next fix

- A 10 year old kid and his sister that survived the attack on their barbaric village and now they go around with Brahmin skull masks and blunt objects to kill giant rats, mole rats, and homeless people to eat.

- A special operative that got separated from his squad

- A Roman Spartan that got zapped into the Fallout Universe and he thinks nothing is wrong, he thinks Caesars Legion is the Roman Empire

And the list goes on. My point is theres so much roleplaying in FNV but nearly none at all in FO4, mainly due to the dialogue. Oh god the dialogue.

What the fuck is with the dialogue now? In FNV if you had enough Science, barter, speech, specific perks, low intelligence etc. you could say a million different things, and now it has the speech of the walking dead game or Mass Effect, Yes, No, Maybe, Sarcastic Yes, gimme monie, which is always 100 caps ffs.

And Power Armor is just utterly ruined for me in FO4 as well, it used to be a thing to look up to, like: ""Wow, I wanna be like that guy!"" Then you go half the game in FNV looking for some veteran rangers to murder, find out they only spawn later in the game, level up enough, murder a BoS paladin for that sweet armor annnd... Power armor training. After all this hassle... It's sooo worth it, you feel like a goddamn god, you might not be one but you feel immensely badass finally wearing what you've looked up to for so long.

But in Fallout 4 you get that shit so damn quick, and then for some reason fight a deathclaw right after? What the fuck?

Also I'm pretty sure everybody here agrees that prestons missions are all repetitive bullshit about settlements and blah blah blah, go kill this, collect that, blah blah blee blah.

I guess the game is pretty cool if you've never played another Fallout game, it's not even an RPG anymore, it's just a shooter aside from the creating your own town thing, which I didn't even give a shit about after like 2 hours, I didn't buy Fallout 4 just to play fucking Sim City without the alien invasions and shit.

And the voice actor (At least the male one) sounds like hes on fucking suicide watch, like hes swallowing his anti-depressants as hes recording the voice, I mean sometimes he has a bit of pep in his step but usually hes just a fucking potato sack squeezing the smallest amount of air out of his system to record these lines.

Again, if you've never played Fallout 1, 2, or New Vegas you'll probably love it, but I don't think anybody can really defend this dumbed down game.

I know I harshly just criticized Fallout 4, ON the Fallout subreddit and I'll probably get crucified but to be honest, I don't HATE Fallout 4, I just think it's massively disappointing to actual Fallout fans that the game turned out to be like this. But there are some good things about it like the V.A.T.S system is a bit nerfed which is good because it was a fucking mess in Fallout 3 and NV and trying to play without it makes you realize how shit the combat is, so good job on this one FO4.

Overall though I'd give this game a 3/10, I tried SOOOOO hard to love it but I can't, 40 hours of gameplay later and I can't even bare to start the fucking thing, I know there's gonna be people who agree with me and some people that just joined Caesars Legion so they have the chance to crucify me but either way I wanna hear your opinions in the comments, hostile or passive.",Fallout,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/42jthd/does_anybody_feel_that_new_vegas_is_way_better/,Discussion,Kittty_Jones,42jthd,/r/Fallout/comments/42jthd/does_anybody_feel_that_new_vegas_is_way_better/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/42jthd/does_anybody_feel_that_new_vegas_is_way_better/,53,2016-01-25

[Arrow grave scene theory-- why I think it's not_____ or ______],"After the 2nd grave scene, many people are now saying that it's either Diggle or Donna who's in the grave. I honestly think that neither of them will die. 

Diggle- If Diggle was the one who died, why wasn't Layla there in the first grave scene?  if there's another grave scene, I assume he'll be revealed as the driver of the limo Felicity and Oliver was on.

Donna-it's not Donna. I mean, if your mother was killed, would you react the same way Felicity did? I dont think so. 

So basically, the 4 choices we have now on who is in the grave is Laurel, Quentin, Malcolm, and Thea. Maybe Katana as well since the Suicide Squad movie is coming up and she HAS to be written off because of the ""no same character bet. TV and movie"" rule  ",arrow,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/42o80g/arrow_grave_scene_theory_why_i_think_its_not_or/,,Avenged7fo,42o80g,/r/arrow/comments/42o80g/arrow_grave_scene_theory_why_i_think_its_not_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/arrow/comments/42o80g/arrow_grave_scene_theory_why_i_think_its_not_or/,8,2016-01-25

I think the Joker will lose his tattoos in the chemicals in Suicide Squad.,"Okay, so the trailer for Suicide Squad showed The Joker jumping into a chemical pit and holding Harley Quinn. 

In another scene, he's laughing around a bunch of knives and guns without his damaged tattoo.


My theory: 

Joker loses his tattoos in this chemical pit and is reborn as a more conventional looking Joker for other DC movies.

Why is Katana in the Suicide Squad,"I was under the impression that Katana was a hero. So when I heard that Katana was going to be in the Suicide Squad movie, I was confused.
