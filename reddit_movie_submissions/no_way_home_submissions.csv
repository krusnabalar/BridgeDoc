AITA for locking the bathroom door?,"I (24f) usually don‚Äôt lock the door. I get up at 4:30am and everyone else (my parents and 22yo brother) were always asleep when I‚Äòm in the bathroom. 
None of us ever really locks it since the outside doesn‚Äôt show if it‚Äôs locked and there have been a few injuries by running into said door - a broken foot, broken nose, concussion, list goes on.
So last week, my brother had his first early shift after a few weeks of afternoon shifts at his new job. 
Now suddenly, my peace and quiet are gone. 
Something to know about my brother: He‚Äôs an absolute brat and will find a way to take everything that‚Äôs not handed to him. 
My other brother (26, he moved out) and I have to back down or we‚Äôll be the idiots blamed in any given scenario.
So, 4:30 am. 
First morning went considerably well, him coming in as I‚Äòm brushing my teeth. No knocking but ‚Ä¶ tolerated for now. 
In the afternoon he asked me to see to it that the bathroom was free for him to use. 
Big nope, buddy. I take less than ten minutes in there, be happy I don‚Äôt shower or do makeup.  
Second morning, he comes bursting in while I‚Äòm on the toilet. I had had cramps all night and knew I‚Äòd be on my period, so I was tired and grumpy. I asked him to step back out for a second but he refused since he ""gotta get ready for work too"". Fine. Deal with me inserting my menstrual cup then. 
Big mistake. He‚Äòs grossed out, yelling at me.
Who told him to watch though? I told him to knock next time if he didn‚Äôt want to see me on the toilet again. 
When I got home that afternoon, mom was waiting for me with a lecture on appropriateness. Like ‚Ä¶ is this 1621 and periods are sin? How could she still take his side? Also, his early yelling woke her up and of course that was my fault, too. 
I told her I‚Äòd make sure that didn‚Äôt happen again. 
So, third morning, I lock the door. 
As it had to be, of course my brother ran into the door head on while I was on the toilet again. I have a feeling he faked that though. 
Picture a 22yo bawling on the floor over what had to be less than an actual head bump. So now my parents are awake and once again I‚Äòm at fault. Because ‚Ä¶ why would I lock the door? Even worse, I took a second to get off the toilet before unlocking to help my poor injured princess of a brother. 
So now I‚Äòm told not to lock up again and just get out of his way if I couldn‚Äôt share. I wouldn‚Äôt even mind him coming in if he would knock and be a tiny bit considerate. 
But hey, that‚Äôs my life. 
I‚Äòm just waiting to move out now, but I‚Äòve been incredibly unlucky to do so. I got cancelled on twice, once I nearly fell for a scam, and one apartment literally burned down the week before we were going to move furniture. 
I was called ""incapable to do something as simple as finding a home"".
For now, I‚Äòll keep the door locked for those few minutes I‚Äòm in the bathroom and wait until he goes back on nightshift. 
Still, I‚Äòm wondering ‚Ä¶ AITA for basically locking him out of the only bathroom we have?",AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pa1l6h/aita_for_locking_the_bathroom_door/,,onebigfluffypillow,pa1l6h,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pa1l6h/aita_for_locking_the_bathroom_door/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pa1l6h/aita_for_locking_the_bathroom_door/,26,2021-08-23

Nightmare Hide and Seek Ambush,"John and Pete hid in the family room, huddled beside the sofa, scrunched up against the wall. The house was dark and quiet, the only sound they heard was one another‚Äôs breathing.

Pete leaned to stick his head out and look beyond the sofa, but John pulled him back with all of his strength. The two buried their faces into the side of the sofa, unsure of what was happening or what to do. 

Barely an hour earlier, they had been playing with the other neighborhood kids. John and Pete were both on the younger side, but the older kids always included both of them without too much grumbling. The two wanted to play, they were always eager to spend as much time with the big kids as possible. 

In the evening glow, the older kids came to the decision to play a night game of hide and seek in teams.

The kids split into two groups, and the seekers went inside Sally and Tammy Butterfield‚Äôs house as it was the closest, to wait for five minutes as the hiders all went to different corners of the spacious, connected backyards to hide. 

John was on the seeker team, while Pete was with the hiders.

One child got inside a bush, while another hid on top of a playhouse, smashing his body flat against the surface of the roof. 

Pete was excellent at climbing trees and though they had all played hide and seek before, those times were in the daylight. In the night, he found a small, shadowed spot where the edge of one of the houses kept the streetlights from reaching him. From above the connected yards, about 10 feet from the ground, he could see the scene play out before him. He saw where most of the other kids had hidden, some putting in more effort, while others took to more obvious spots. 

In the tree, he was just high enough to be out of the finders‚Äô line of sight, but not so high as to not be supported by the thicker, meatier limbs.

The glass door of the Butterfield home opened and the children emerged in a row.

‚ÄúReady or not, here we come!‚Äù shouted one of the Butterfield sisters. 

The children ran at full blast down the hill into the basin of grass, trees, swing sets, sheds, gardens, flowerbeds, and basement landings. They slowed down and fanned out, checking in around the obvious places to hide. 

Cassidy was first to be found, a teenager named Tony marched straight up to where she had been hiding, around the corner of a shed, barely hidden at all. Cassidy was a step sibling of two of the regular kids, only appearing every few weekends. When she wasn‚Äôt frowning, her lackluster, expressionless face, wrote volumes about how she felt interacting with kids she barely knew, banished outside, as she called it, as the parents insist she participate in the neighborhood even though she didn‚Äôt regularly live there. 

She was a permanent grump. Her step brother and sister constantly teased and berated her, doing anything they could to poke fun at her during these group games. 

Cassidy sulked back towards their house. In the night glow, Pete watched her cross the hill. Then, another kid ran up behind her and grabbed at her hand. The child, who was quick and didn‚Äôt look like one of the others, appeared to emerge from nowhere. He or she wore black from head to toe, with a hood pulled up around the face. The outline of their body shifted, like he didn‚Äôt want to stand completely upright, but rather shifted weight back and forth from one foot to the other. 

The teen yanked her hand back.

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, someone already found me!‚Äù she shouted.

This new kid took her hand again, but as she shook and pulled it back, it wasn‚Äôt let go. 

‚ÄúGet off!‚Äù she yelled, pulled hard and stumbled to the ground.

It held her still, without even a hint of going off balance as she fell.

For the first time since her hand was taken, Cassidy turned to look up at the cloaked figure and screamed. 

She screamed so loud that both the kids searching and hiding turned or poked their heads out to look in their direction. 

She shrieked over and over backpedaling from the thing that held her hand firm. It loomed over her, moved in closer, and launched onto her.  

More of them emerged then, all identically dressed, each the same height and shape, from the darkness. These children in black, at least at first, they looked like children, came from all corners of nowhere, behind houses, over fences, and into Pete‚Äôs line of sight. Dozens of black hoods scattered into the connected yards from all corners. Four more engulfed Cassidy, her screams accompanied by what sounded like ripping, tearing, gnawing, and growling. 

Pete watched transfixed. When the children finished with her, there was nothing left. The four bounded off in different directions. It was still pretty dark, despite the illumination from the neighborhood lights, but except for some crushed grass, it looked like no one had even been there. Everything was gone, even her clothing, even her short dark hair and wire framed glasses. 

Pete looked down onto a slaughter. One of the hoods yanked the teen boy hiding in a bush with impossible strength, threw him back to the ground, and devoured him in massive chunks. The two closest hooded ones joined in. They hissed, scratched, and clawed until he too was no more.

The Butterfield sisters were in the center of the chaos when it erupted, passed by several of the hooded children, huddled together, and crying. It was over quickly for the two of them also, at least eight figures descended down on them and ripped them to nothing.

Children and teens abandoned their hiding spots and their searching for others and fled towards the exterior of the neighborhood, towards the main road. Others ran off towards the retention pond. Swaths of the evil, hooded monsters followed and quickly caught up. 

With how the hills crested, Pete was unable to see if anyone got away, or if they all were consumed too. 

He stayed still as a stone. He didn‚Äôt know if they all had gone after the kids who ran or not, or if they would return to hunt for him or anyone else who was remaining.

The tree shook with a thunk, like a squirrel had launched from a nearby branch. The top of three wobbled and waved from side to side.

He looked up and gasped at the short, hooded figure who had somehow jumped into the tree well above him. He hadn‚Äôt seen a full face until this moment, and didn‚Äôt realize the skin of the creature was a pale blue. It looked almost translucent, with eyes that were black marbles. Holding onto limbs, it hissed at him, and began a descent. 

Shakily, Pete had also begun his quick climb down, even as he looked up at the thing, who continued to shake the tree wildly as it moved downwards. It pursued with one arm outstretched towards him, its eyes fixated on his. Pete nearly fell backwards, unable to break his gaze, but caught himself and lifted his body onto the thick branches below, and around the trunk. 

The thing climbed down with less grace and stability, tearing through the branches, unsteadily gaining on the boy. 

When Pete was about five feet from the bottom, his legs hugging the trunk, he flung himself backwards into the grass.

He landed and tumbled into a somersault and rolled back onto his feet, in a panicked leap.

He ran towards the open door at the top of the hill, his heart thumping wildly in his chest, he ran as fast as his slender legs could carry him. 

A different small figure emerged from near the basement door and ran next to him. Pete flailed and shoved them, as he pushed towards the door. When his hands connected, he realized it was his friend John he had shoved, not one of the hooded figures. 

Hisses and thumping feet followed them. 

Gulping for air, he pulled John back up and the two of them pulled one another into the house, fumbling with the sliding glass door, watching as three hooded creatures chased after them and pawed at the door handle. 

The lock on the sliding glass door latched into place, as the hooded creatures smacked into the window and pulled at the door. They banged on it with hard, open palms. 

The boys trembled and shook from head to toe. They stumbled towards the darkest place in the room, away from the windows and doors, in the far corner of the family room, behind the edge of the sofa.

Eventually, the screams from the other children stopped. The creatures too stopped banging on the sliding glass door, and the only sound the two boys heard was one another‚Äôs breathing and even that seemed too loud. 

They sat in agonizing stillness and doing their best to stay as still and quiet as always, clutching one another, not letting the other move to look out, burying their faces into the soft, carpeted cover of sofa, through tears and sweat.

A window broke. 

The glass shattered and was followed by three distinct crashes, loud thumps. It came from above them, the ceiling heaved and the beams squeaked and moaned. The children clutched on another even closer now.

Pete whispered to his very good friend, ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt open your eyes, whatever you do, don‚Äôt open your eyes.‚Äù 

They held one another tight, their two bodies pressed into one another, clutched, the sound of two thumping hearts thumped as one, Loud, heavy footsteps ran down the stairs. Hisses and growls filled the room. 

It felt like any second. They could feel the creatures looming over them in an instant, ready to strike.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶. Open‚Ä¶ your‚Ä¶ eyes‚Ä¶‚Äù Pete choked out in tears again. John nodded and pressed into his friend‚Äôs shoulder even more. 

And with that, the captive sense of dread befell them, still as statues, they waited to feel the first bite and tear.

Instead, the sound of a light switch being flicked filled the room.

A girlish voice said in a cheerful tone, ‚ÄúLast two, we found you!‚Äù 

Still, the two didn‚Äôt open their eyes. 

And when Tammy Butterfield touched Pete‚Äôs shoulder, they both screamed.

‚ÄúHey, hey, what‚Äôs going on you two?‚Äù She laughed. 

‚ÄúWay to be a bunch of babies!‚Äù Tony teased.

The two boys looked up in the room. The sliding glass door was closed, but the latch was wide open. The room was clean and bright. They were surrounded by the entire group of teens and kids watching them, laughing and cackling at the two embraced in fear. 

Even Cassidy wore a grin. Tony teased some other words, about them being babies, but the words were lost on both John and Pete. 

The whole room laughed as in a daze, they walked towards the front door.

No figures met them. Nothing seemed broken or destroyed. 

‚ÄúWait, where‚Äôre you going?‚Äù one said, but the two boys didn‚Äôt answer. They couldn‚Äôt. They wandered to their homes, looking behind them every few steps, and in the trees, and behind cars and houses, but they saw nothing. The night was warm and as friendly as ever.

John‚Äôs house was first. He said nothing, but nodded at Pete as he went inside.

Pete, exhausted from the adrenaline having worn off, stumbled as quickly and quietly as he could to his own house and locked the door behind him.

The clock read just after 8. His father looked up at him from the living room. ‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù

He uttered, ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù headed upstairs to his bedroom, not looking at his father, and not looking at anything.",scarystories,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/p9rq52/nightmare_hide_and_seek_ambush/,,Lute_Graves,p9rq52,/r/scarystories/comments/p9rq52/nightmare_hide_and_seek_ambush/,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/p9rq52/nightmare_hide_and_seek_ambush/,5,2021-08-23

Tips to Improve Social Skills in Children: In the Classroom &amp; Beyond,"  

https://preview.redd.it/msh4dpf5a3j71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3839c2fe8d0a1d8bf3d19c6465786e71eb1447f

Do you wish that your child can play with others, is not shy to talk in front of people, and make new friends? If yes, then this paper of content is for you as it is jam-packed with five methods to help your child be a better socializer. These methods open up on teaching children social skills in the classroom and at home.

**The golden tips to make your child a better social person**

Before we begin, let‚Äôs ask you an important question, what makes a school an [**Ideal Education Point (New Choudhary Public School)**](https://newchoudharypublicschool.com/) for students? It‚Äôs a school that teaches its students everything, and we at Ideal Education Point (New Choudhary Public School) do just that. Now for the methods.

**Help your child build a sense of emotion**

Expressions are not always delightful, and your child should know that it‚Äôs completely fine. You should teach your child about the five feelings as it will help achieve affinity and understand others. Your child can read books with such themes, or another way is to watch movies with your little one where characters have strong emotions.

We at Ideal Education Point recommend anime or animated movies such as weathering with you, the polar express, the boss baby, etc.

**Teach your little one how to ask for help**

The best way to improve your child‚Äôs social skills is to teach your child how to ask for help when in need. Teaching your child this essential skill is helpful in social situations. This way, your child will not feel shy or embarrassed in situations when asking friends or adults for help.

For example, in situations like what game to play in recess or choosing a role-play, the child can learn how to play and study along like this. 

**Help your child build a social circle**

A better way is to bring the social to your child, rather than take your child to a social. Did you understand anything? No, allow us to explain when it comes to helping your child create a social circle. Nothing is better than doing it from the comfort of your home.

To do it, you can invite your child‚Äôs friends to your home for parties and playdates. Personally speaking, children love these things. If you do it on a, let‚Äôs say, weekly basis, your child will create a better social circle and will get more confidence in making friends while growing up.

**Letters work better when your child needs help**

As parents, it is common for us to help our children right away by giving them the required help before they even ask. This method, however, will make your children lazy and introverts over time.

So what to do? Make your child write a letter to you, which should specify the exact requirements and feelings. This way, your children will become more confident and not hesitate to talk to others over time.

If you wish your children to learn other such ways to become more socially confident, enroll your children at our school, **Ideal Education Point (New Choudhary Public School)**, the [**Best RBSE School For Commerce**](https://newchoudharypublicschool.com/academics-departments/commerce/)**.**

My (f24) sister (f26) has destroyed my room and its okay because she has mental health issues and I don't know what to do,"
Hi guys. long time lurker, first time posting on here so sorry for any errors or anything. I am really sorry but this is super long. 

TLDR: My sister (26f) has pretty much traumatised me from stealing my things, and making me grow up fast from a young age potentially has mental issues, has destroyed my room and has made me relive the bullshit that she used to do when we were younger. family want me to forgive and move on, im still pissed. What do I do?

So a little back story; I come from a big family, I have 4 sisters (twins f17, f26, f35 and myself f24) and two brothers (m23 and m34). Currently, the twins, my younger brother and I are living at home. My parents divorced when I was 4 and my dad lives abroad. 

So I just want some advice about my sister, but I want you to understand where I am coming from so I'm just gonna give you guys some insight into our relationship. So my sis Catherine (f26) and I were pretty much raised as twins, we weren't particularly close ourselves but whatever. When we got older, she starts staying out late, missing school, going out with boys, the works. Me and my mother would be out all hours of the night looking for her and would find her with strange men and women drinking and having sex. She would only come home to get money from my mom and my mom would give it to her. My mum back then was so weak when it came to her, she thought if she gave in to her requests then maybe she'll listen to her. Stupid, I know, but my mom regrets this. Catherine pretty much moved out at this point. At 15/16. We would constantly report her missing to the police and half the time they couldn't find her. if they did, they'd being her home kicking and screaming and drunk out of her mind and as soon as the police would leave, she would trash the house and leave literally within 20 minutes. Social workers were involved but there was literally nothing they could do, this girl was uncontrollable. I feel sorry for my younger sisters as their childhood is tainted with this girls bullshit. 

At this point, she started to steal my stuff. She was like a fucking roach, anything new or cool I left in my room she'd take. If I was out and I knew she'd be home I'd literally cry because I know all the gifts and anything remotely nice I had was gone. This sounds like nothing, but it was really scarred me. I remember my mother bought me a brand new outfit from head to toe and a cute bag for school when I was 16. I was getting into fashion at this age. When I got home I just saw Catherine wearing the whole outfit and bag and getting ready to go out. She literally ripped the tags off and put it on. I was like what the hell, take off my stuff. and she said no, what are you going to do. my mum was just sat there and I was like mom tell her to take it off. And Catherine straight up said 'I control mum, she's not gonna say shit to me.' and my mom was just silent. I literally just went upstairs and balled my eyes out. My mum didn't think it was a big deal, she has the mentality sisters share stuff blah blah blah. yeah share, not destroy and keep. Guys I can list so many instances as infuriating as this. Her stealing money I saved, taking my brand-new items, my family knowing, me finding it a month later absolutely mangled and in crap condition or finding my perfume bottles empty. Even sentimental stuff, she did not care. I go out and see her deadbeat friends wearing my clothes. Like head to toe. Do you know how infuriating that is? Me and my family learnt the hard way that Catherine is really a pathological liar and you genuinely cannot believe a word she says to this day. This may sound so trivial to you guys but it really fucked me up.

She is someone who likes to know everyones weaknesses so that in an argument, so she can bring them up. when she got older around, 20-25, the only reason she would come to the house is for money and food. my mum would just give it to her and basically enabled her behaviour. me and my other siblings would tell my mum to stop but she just couldn't. she felt as though if she stopped, she would never see her again and Catherine would just cut her off. I have no other way to say this but Catherine is a fucking evil. there is no low that she will sink to. She has cursed my dead grandmother to my mum which she knows my mum is so sensitive about as she didn't get to see her when she died. She did this because my mum refused to give her money. She has terrorised my younger sisters anxiety and depression, and called my other sister ugly for YEARS. Despite me and my older sister trying to undue this, my younger sister still thinks she's ugly till this day. This has sparked arguments between myself and her, my brothers and her and she will literally make up things in an argument. like she would say my older sister slept with this guy and how everyone knows she's a slut. Bear in mind we are an orthodox family so this kind of talk in the household is just so foreign. This guy is MARRIED with 3 children. my sister called his sister on the spot and told her to ask him what the hells going on. Meanwhile Catherine is in the background screaming she has proof, that she's not showing obvs. This man came to my house within 20 minutes and was like what the fuck is going on to Catherine and asked why she is lying. She was just dumbfounded and couldnt speak. Im trying to illustrate the lengths this girl will go to and how much trauma she has put us all through as a family. I hope I have conveyed this properly. 

Fast forward to now. Catherine is still doing what she does and not much has changed. We as a family are not close to her at all. My mum has toughed up quite a lot and does not take her shit. She has had a child who my mum has adopted and she lives with us because she's not capable of taking care of her. I am LC with her but do say hi when she is around because i have learnt that it is better to be on her ‚Äògood side‚Äô. We have just found out that Catherine has been in an abusive relationship since 16 with a man 20 years her senior. she recently broke up with him and since then she has gone crazy. she has become paranoid. At first, she was constantly coming to the house saying he is watching her and has hacked her phone. That kind of talk. She stopped eating. Then she started saying my mom, me and my other sisters have slept with him and are trying to take him away from her. and then we have always been jealous and we are evil. she started giving us death threats and posting on social media about us and how evil we are. I have never even met this man, I wouldn't even recognise him if I saw him. It was in these manic episodes that she admitted she was addicted to cocain and weed and her used to give it to her. She was having the beginnings of a mental breakdown. My mum took her in because she couldn't look after herself, she was sleeping in a ball on the ground with foil on the windows. I was pissed that she was here and told mum im moving out, since most of the anger was directed at me and she kept telling me I was going to die. like constantly. my mum begged me to stay and to help her ie. talk to the police, mental health services, her parole officer (she has been in and out of prison). my mum doesn't speak English so that's why I had to do all this. anyways. One day she just went mad and punched my mum and attacked the twins. I pulled her off and called the police and she was taken in for the night (they didn't press charges). So. she comes back to my mums house and im like to my mum wtf why is she here. my mum and my siblings (apart from the twins) are like let her stay she's not well blah blah blah. Im like she's gotta go and my mums like lets just give her one more chance. im like ????? she's unpredictable and her behaviour is escalating. the crazy thing is she kept saying she's going to get ME. so anyways. Me and my mom go out in the morning and come back within 40 mins. within that time this bitch has gone into my room (which I accidentally left unlocked) and destroyed my MacBook, perfumes, graduation stufff, just thousands of pounds worth of my things and layed it all out on the sofa like artwork and sat in the middle of it waiting for me to come home. She literally put nail varnish all over on my brand new designer clothes deliberately. I lost it. I called the police and and told them she needs help. Now that she's out, she still comes to the house for food and such and pretends she doesn't remember what she did. I know she does because she makes comments like so did she get a new laptop etc. I feel like im losing my mind. Im stuck between having sympathy for her and being pissed.

My (f24) sister (f26) destroyed my room and its okay because she has mental health issues and i dont know how to feel,"Hi guys. long time lurker, first time posting on here so sorry for any errors or anything. I am really sorry but this is super long.

TLDR: My sister (26f) has pretty much traumatised me from stealing my things, and making me grow up fast from a young age potentially has mental issues, has destroyed my room and has made me relive the bullshit that she used to do when we were younger. family want me to forgive and move on, im still pissed. What do I do?

So a little back story; I come from a big family, I have 4 sisters (twins f17, f26, f35 and myself f24) and two brothers (m23 and m34). Currently, the twins, my younger brother and I are living at home. My parents divorced when I was 4 and my dad lives abroad. 

So I just want some advice about my sister, but I want you to understand where I am coming from so I'm just gonna give you guys some insight into our relationship. So my sis Catherine (f26) and I were pretty much raised as twins, we weren't particularly close ourselves but whatever. When we got older, she starts staying out late, missing school, going out with boys, the works. Me and my mother would be out all hours of the night looking for her and would find her with strange men and women drinking and having sex. I used to go with my mum because if I didn‚Äôt she would go alone and i didn‚Äôt want her to get hurt. My older siblings didn‚Äôt really care but i did. Catherine would only come home to get money from my mom and my mom would give it to her. My mum back then was so weak when it came to her, she thought if she gave in to her requests then maybe she'll listen to her. Stupid, I know, but my mom regrets this. Catherine pretty much moved out at this point. At 15/16. We would constantly report her missing to the police and half the time they couldn't find her. if they did, they'd bring her home kicking and screaming and drunk out of her mind and as soon as the police would leave, she would trash the house and leave literally within 20 minutes. Social workers were involved but there was literally nothing they could do, this girl was uncontrollable. I feel sorry for my younger sisters as their childhood is tainted with this girls bullshit. 

At this point, she started to steal my stuff. She was like a fucking roach, anything new or cool I left in my room she'd take. If I was out and I knew she'd be home I'd literally cry because I know all the gifts and anything remotely nice I had was gone. This sounds like nothing, but it was really scarred me. I remember my mother bought me a brand new outfit from head to toe and a cute bag for school when I was 16. I was getting into fashion at this age. When I got home I just saw Catherine wearing the whole outfit and bag and getting ready to go out. She literally ripped the tags off and put it on. I was like what the hell, take off my stuff. and she said no, what are you going to do. my mum was just sat there and I was like mom tell her to take it off. And Catherine straight up said 'I control mum, she's not gonna say shit to me.' and my mom was just silent. I literally just went upstairs and balled my eyes out. My mum didn't think it was a big deal, she has the mentality sisters share stuff blah blah blah. yeah share, not destroy or keep. Guys I can list so many instances as infuriating as this. Her stealing money I saved, taking my brand-new items, my family knowing, me finding it a month later absolutely mangled and in crap condition or finding my perfume bottles empty. Even sentimental stuff, she did not care. I go out and see her deadbeat friends wearing my clothes. Like head to toe. Do you know how infuriating that is? Me and my family learnt the hard way that Catherine is really a pathological liar and you genuinely cannot believe a word she says to this day. This may sound so trivial but the powerlessness, the lack of control really fucked me up because there was nothing i could do.

She is someone who likes to know everyones weaknesses so that in an argument, so she can bring them up. when she got older around, 20-25, the only reason she would come to the house is for money and food. my mum would just give it to her and basically enabled her behaviour. me and my other siblings would tell my mum to stop but she just couldn't. she felt as though if she stopped, she would never see her again and Catherine would just cut her off. I have no other way to say this but Catherine is evil. there is no low that she will sink to. She has cursed my dead grandmother to my mum which she knows my mum is so sensitive about as she didn't get to see her when she died. She did this because my mum refused to give her money. She has terrorised my younger sisters anxiety and depression, and called my other sister ugly for YEARS. Despite me and my older sister trying to undue this, my younger sister still thinks she's ugly till this day. This has sparked arguments between myself and her, my brothers and her and she will literally make up things in an argument. like she would say my older sister slept with this guy and how everyone knows she's a slut. Bear in mind we are an orthodox family so this kind of talk in the household is just so foreign. This guy is MARRIED with 3 children. my sister called his sister on the spot and told her to ask him what the hells going on. Meanwhile Catherine is in the background screaming she has proof, that she's not showing obvs. This man came to my house within 20 minutes and was like what the fuck is going on to Catherine and asked why she is lying. She was just dumbfounded and couldnt speak. Im trying to illustrate the lengths this girl will go to and how much trauma she has put us all through as a family. I hope I have conveyed this properly. 

Fast forward to now. Catherine is still doing what she does and not much has changed. We as a family are not close to her at all. My mum has toughed up quite a lot and does not take her shit. She has had a child who my mum has adopted and she lives with us because she's not capable of taking care of her. I am LC with her but do say hi when she is around because i have learnt that it is better to be on her ‚Äògood side‚Äô. We have just found out that Catherine has been in an abusive relationship since 16 with a man 20 years her senior. she recently broke up with him and since then she has gone crazy. she has become paranoid. At first, she was constantly coming to the house saying he is watching her and has hacked her phone. That kind of talk. She stopped eating. Then she started saying my mom, me and my other sisters have slept with him and are trying to take him away from her. and then we have always been jealous and we are evil. she started giving us death threats and posting on social media about us and how evil we are. I have never even met this man, I wouldn't even recognise him if I saw him. It was in these manic episodes that she admitted she was addicted to cocain and weed and her used to give it to her. She was having the beginnings of a mental breakdown. My mum took her in because she couldn't look after herself, she was sleeping in a ball on the ground with foil on the windows in her apartment. I was pissed that she was here and told mum im moving out, since most of the anger was directed at me and she kept telling me I was going to die. like constantly. my mum begged me to stay and to help her ie. talk to the police, mental health services, her parole officer (she has been in and out of prison). my mum doesn't speak English so that's why I had to do all this. anyways. One day she just went mad and punched my mum and attacked the twins. I pulled her off and called the police and she was taken in for the night (they didn't press charges). So. she comes back to my mums house and im like to my mum wtf why is she here. my mum and my siblings (apart from the twins) are like let her stay she's not well blah blah blah. Im like she's gotta go and my mums like lets just give her one more chance. im like ????? she's unpredictable and her behaviour is escalating. the crazy thing is she kept saying she's going to get ME. so anyways. Me and my mom go out in the morning and come back within 40 mins. within that time this bitch has gone into my room (which I accidentally left unlocked) and destroyed my MacBook, perfumes, graduation stufff, just thousands of pounds worth of my things and layed it all out on the sofa like artwork and sat in the middle of it waiting for me to come home.

Now that she's out, she still comes to the house for food and such and pretends she doesn't remember what she did. I know she does because she makes comments like so did she get a new laptop etc. I feel like im losing my mind. Im stuck between having sympathy for her and being I get shes been in an abusive relationship and he was her enabler with drugs and she was exposed to this as a child. But what about the shit shes put me through. Im struggling to understand my emotions. everyone thinks its not a big deal. I buy everything myself and there are basically no consequences for her for what she did. Im not fucking rich. My mum is being so sickly kind to her and its making me BURN. my family want me to forgive her and just get over it since 'she's not well'.  my mum keeps making digs at me.

## In which cases should I apply for a Japan visa Multiple Entry?

In the case of short-stay visas, there are multiple-stay visas for visitors (maximum Japan visa validity: 5 years) and multiple-stay visas for cultural or intellectual persons (maximum visa validity: 10 years). The latter may be used as a visitor or for visiting family members, as well as on a second visit. Multi-entry visas for the spouse of a Japanese citizen are also available.

## How do I apply for a valid multiple-visa?

When applying for multiple-entry visas, you must request a ‚ÄúReason to apply for multiple-entry visas‚Äù form. Depending on the intent of the travel, the applicant must request additional documentation to prove that they are eligible for multiple-entry visas. Please refer to the related parts of the ‚ÄúVisa Types‚Äù list, such as Items 16 and 17. Please note that the submission of the ‚ÄúReason for multiple entry visa application‚Äù form does not ensure multiple visa issuances. In the event that a multiple-entry visa is not given, if the necessary documentation for the submission of a single-entry (or double-entry) Visa is submitted, the visa review will also be carried out accordingly.

## I also obtained a Japan Multiple Entry visa (30 days stay) valid for five years and traveled to Japan for tourism/pleasure purposes. Is it necessary to use this Visa next time you fly to Japan for business purposes?

* *Suppose you wish to stay under 30 days and your activities fall within the category of ‚ÄúTemporary Visitor‚Äù (Sightseeing, entertainment, sports, visiting relatives, inspection tours, attending lectures or meetings, business interaction, or other similar activities throughout a short stay in Japan). In that case, you may use this visa to enter Japan. However, when you enter Japan, you must apply for the immigration card indicating your intent and be checked by an immigration officer.*
* *Please notice that these activities are not allowed as a ‚ÄúTemporary Visitor,‚Äù such as remunerated activities. If you plan to travel to Japan to participate in such activities as paid or repaid activities, please obtain a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from the Japanese Immigration Services Agency before applying for a valid visa.*

## If I apply for a ‚ÄúTemporary Visitor‚Äù visa for the very first time, may I use it only for a limited stay of 15 days?

The length of stay for a short-stay visa is 15 days, 30 days, or 90 days. The analysis will be carried out according to your intent and schedule.

## How long is the Japan visa validity Philippines?

Single-entry visas are also only valid for entry into Japan on one occasion. The duration of validity of a single entry visa is up to 3 months. It is not a necessary to extend the period of validity of the Visa. If a foreign citizen residing in Japan wishes to have his/her stay extended when he/she is in Japan, please visit the Regional Immigration Office.

Multiple entry visas can be given to business travelers, etc. The period of validity of these visas is between 1 ‚Äì 5 years, and this visa may be used at any number of times throughout the period of validity.

## If I have two or more reasons to travel to Japan, such as ‚Äútourism‚Äù and ‚Äúcommercial,‚Äù how do I apply?

Please prepare the documents needed for the main purpose of your travel. However, if they prepare and submit the necessary documentation for each purpose, the review will be carried out for each purpose of the trip. Reasonable visas will be issued if the requirements for granting a visa are met for one of the purposes.

## Is it necessary to get a visa even though I‚Äôve been deported from Japan previously?

Review of visa applications is based on individual circumstances, and the previous deportation doesn‚Äôt automatically mean that your visa application will be rejected. If you have offended or been deported in the previous, your application will be reviewed on the basis of that evidence. The visa application does have a history of deportation and breaches in the past, so please fill out the form with depth information.

## Is it appropriate to include the original documents? What will I do if I am unable to prepare the initial documents?

In the case of documents that can be accessed twice, the original must be submitted. However, in the case of images and old documents that you wish to retain the original, you can submit a copy and attach a letter explaining why you cannot submit the original. If you are unable to prepare all of the necessary documents, please send a letter explaining why you are unable to do so.

## I have a Certificate of Eligibility application in Japan; can I apply for a short-stay visa while waiting for the results of my Certificate of Eligibility?

No, after receiving your Certificate of Eligibility, you must apply for a visa.

## Why does the Japanese Embassy in the Philippines approve a visa application form approved by travel agencies instead of explicitly accepting them?

Before the method of filing through agencies was put in place, visa applicants had to line and wait a long time at the Embassy. There were also instances in which the applicants were made victims of fake documents‚Äô purchase and sale by fraudsters in front of the Embassy. As a result of these situations, the Japanese Embassy introduced a visa application system via approved travel agencies in July 2007.

## How long is the time of review of the application?

The average processing period shall be five working days from the day following the application‚Äôs date of approval. However, if some kind of verification is necessary (submission of additional documentation, interview with the applicant, inquiries, and etc.) or if a visa application is made for a long-stay period without a Certificate of Eligibility, etc., the test may take much longer than 5 working days (from several weeks to several months). It is therefore suggested that you apply your application well before the planned date of departure.

## My date of departure is near. Can you grant me a visa as soon as possible?

The Embassy cannot determine whether to grant or deny a visa application before the critical review has been completed. Embassy process applications equally in the order in which they are submitted as soon as possible Apply for a visa once your travel schedule has been determined.

## Tell me why the embassy declined visa application.

The explanation for the denial is that your application did not meet the requirements for granting a visa. The Embassy does not give you the precise reason for the refusal because, if we do, the details might be used to get around the visa review process to access Japan for illegal or unfair purposes. It will delay the proper visa application process in the future and have detrimental effects on Japanese society.

## May I re-apply immediately after my visa application has been rejected?

The Embassy will not approve your visa application if your previous application has been refused, and you will apply for the same reason within 6 months of your denial. However, there are situations where we consider an application if you need to fly to Japan for humanitarian purposes. Consult with the Japan Embassy or Consulate where you intend to apply for a visa before applying.

## Why my Japan visa denied reason?

A visa is not any more than one of the conditions for an application to land in Japan and does not ensure that you will be able to reach Japan. Even if you have a visa valid, you might not be permitted to enter Japan, e.g., in situations where you make a false declaration about your activities in Japan or if a reason for your refusal to land is identified in the course of an immigration inspector‚Äôs investigation.

## Are there any limits on how many occasions I can reach Japan?

There is no limit on how many times you will reach Japan. However, if you plan to remain in Japan for more than half a year (180 days) as a ‚ÄúTemporary Visitor,‚Äù you will not be permitted to reach Japan because it may not be considered a temporary visit.

## May I extend my stay after entering Japan with a ‚ÄúTemporary-Visitor‚Äù visa? Is it possible to move from a ‚ÄúTemporary-Visitor‚Äù to some other residence status after reaching Japan?

If you wish to an extended your stay or change your residency status after entering Japan, please visit Japan‚Äôs Immigration Services Agency. However, there must be exceptional conditions to alter the status of a ‚ÄúTemporary Visitor.‚Äù

## When am I expected to apply for a visa?

Applicants should apply as soon as possible, taking into account the average processing times and their expected date of travel. However, they should also not apply within 90 days of the expected date of travel.

## Who‚Äôs going to decide if I get a visa?

The Embassy of Japan shall review and decide on all visa applications.

## If I don‚Äôt have a paper for a specific purpose, what do I do?

In the event that the applicants do not have the appropriate documentation and are also able to properly obtain it before their travel schedule to Japan, they shall mention that in the cover letter. The cover letter should have been in the original form and signed by the client and cover the explanation for the paper‚Äôs failure.

## Would I be asked to submit additional documentation after my application has been submitted?

The Embassy may often request additional details of Japan for the evaluation process. In the process, they will request applicants to send additional documentation in addition to the documents indicated in the Requirement List. Each applicant has different requirements and situations, and often the Embassy of Japan does not become aware of them until the application has been approved, so there are certain documents that not everyone is asked to send at the outset.

## Can I attend the personal Interview to obtain Japan Visa?

The Embassy can often ask applicants of Japan for a personal interview.

## I want to invite a foreign citizen to Japan. What kind of procedures is required?

* *In the event of an invitation for a short-stay period (in the event that you invite relatives or associates, employees of a business with which you are associated, etc., for a period of stay of 90-days or less and therefore do not pay income), please write a Letter of Purpose for Invitation and formulate a Stay Schedule. If you are hosting a person from China/Russia/CIS countries/Georgia, and if you are paying travel expenses rather than the visa applicant (who wants to travel to Japan), the Letter of Assurance, the guarantor‚Äôs residence certification and documentation verifying the guarantor‚Äôs ability to pay the expenses must also be prepared in accordance to the above documents, regardless of the application.*
* *In the event of an invitation for just a long-term stay (wife, job, research, etc.), it is suggested that you begin by applying for a Certification of Eligibility to the nearest Regional Immigration Office.*
* *Once you completed/gather all of the above documents, please give them to the visa applicant.*

## Is it appropriate to go by myself with the Japanese Embassy/Consulate General to apply for a visa?

There are three forms of applying for a visa**:**

(1) The applicant for a visa shall go directly to the Japanese Embassy/Consulate General.

(2) The visa applicant shall write a proxy letter and receive a proxy to the Japanese Embassy/Consulate General in his/her place of residence.

(3) The visa applicant shall use an authorized travel agent authorized by the Japanese Embassy/Consulate General. However, based on the situation of your country or territory, there are cases in which the applicant can only send the documents to the Japanese Embassy/Consulate or by an approved travel agent.

## What conditions do I have to fulfill for a Japan Visa?

You must prove to the officer that you meet all of Japan‚Äôs Immigration criteria set out below then you‚Äôll be in Japan for a temporary stay.

* *Show that you must have enough money to keep yourself and your relatives in Japan and to return home;*

In other terms, you cannot apply for a visa at your holiday destination; however, whether there are unavoidable circumstances, please contact the Japanese Embassy/Consulate General where you‚Äôd like to apply for a visa before applying.

## Do I need to travel and health insurance?

The Japan Rail Pass will only be purchased from outside Japan, which is only valid for visitors with a temporary visitor visa. Any person with a longer stay visa (such as those for work, research, or if you are a legal resident) is not eligible. The Japan Rail Pass may be obtained for 7, 14, or 21 consecutive days.

## As a ‚Äúguarantee,‚Äù to what extent do I should be responsible?

The ‚Äúguarantor‚Äù of the visa application is the person who has made a guarantee to the head of the embassy/consulate (Japanese Ambassador/Consul-General, etc.) that the visa applicant can remain legally in Japan. The guarantor‚Äôs duties only include moral responsibilities and do not include legal responsibilities such as that of the ‚Äúguarantor‚Äù in the Civil Code. However, suppose it is understood that the guaranteed issues (expenses for the applicant‚Äôs stay in Japan, reimbursement of travel expenses, compliance with the laws and regulations) have not been adequately addressed. In that case, that person will lose credibility as a guarantor in corresponding visa applications. However, be mindful that if the guarantor/inviting person made the false statement in the documentation concerning their relationship with the visa applicant or the intent of the visit, or if the guarantor/inviting person caused the entry of terrorists into Japan or crimes such as trafficking in human beings, they may be held criminally liable.

## In my old Travel document, which expires, I have a current valid Visa? What am I doing?

You must switch your valid Visa to the new Travel document before using the new one, whether you have a valid visa on an old Travel document and have recently renewed your Travel document (since it expired or was stolen or your name has altered). If you‚Äôve had a physical visa sticker or an E-visa, this applies.

## Is there any way to rectify the mistakes if I make any in my application for Japan visa?

Advanced IP Intercom Systems,"So, what are IP [intercom systems](https://bas-ip.com/) and what are they for?

IP means that the system of data transmission between the elements of the system is carried out using the TCP / IP protocol, which significantly expands the capabilities of such systems, namely:

**- Easy to install and at the same time flexible to upgrade and expand the system**

Cable management is simplified through the use of TCP / IP architecture, which allows significant savings in cabling. If it is necessary to replace a specific unit, only the replacement of this unit is required, and not the entire system, that is, the integrity or operability of the entire system is not disturbed. Any installer of local networks can carry out work on the installation of the system. For the stability and security of the system, it is not recommended to connect any other devices not related to video intercom to the network equipment (however, this recommendation is the same for IP video surveillance).

**- Ability to integrate with gas, water, light meters and transfer information to the central station.**

This function is very useful both for those who want to control their personal needs and energy costs, and for those who intend to centrally monitor the total consumption, for example, all residents of a multi-storey building or an entire cottage community. Today, Europeans have long been using and analyzing such data with might and main to reduce not only their personal costs, but also to save land resources, especially in the context of constantly rising prices and shortages of natural resources.

**- Ability to broadcast photos, videos and text messages both centrally and individually**

This is a very interesting opportunity, especially for centralized systems, since it makes it possible to individually or massively inform about certain events in the life of a village, a multi-storey building or even an entire neighborhood. And no one will say that they have not received the message, since everything is stored in the memory of both the home monitor and the central station.

It should also be noted that using this function, a developer company or a company that serves a house (village) can centrally send messages about the need to pay for electricity / gas / other services, and send advertising messages to partner companies (for example cinemas about the premieres of new films or, say, an advertisement for a good restaurant that is nearby).

**- Multifunctional** [**intercom monitors**](https://bas-ip.com/catalog/intercoms/)**: video intercom between subscribers, photo frame, MP3 / MGPEG player**

Subscriber devices no longer look like faceless tubes or scary monitors. Monitors of IP systems, as a rule, are equipped with screens with TouchScreen technology (without buttons). The screens themselves are large in size - from 7 ""to 10"" (although there are 4 ""models) and a very ergonomic and stylish design. In addition to visual appeal, they are also multifunctional, as well as technically progressive, thanks to an internal processor of the latest generation (as opposed to individual ones where older technologies are used). With the help of their software, they, as a rule, are able to read information from an SD card or USB flash drive, photo, video and audio files. You can easily watch your favorite movie while doing it in the kitchen (or turn on the cartoon for your child), play back photos from memory and work in the photo frame mode (this way your favorite photos will always be displayed on the intercom). The screen protection function can also work in clock mode and the time will always be clearly visible on the wall.

Optionally, you can expand the system and implement the function of a smart home (these capabilities are different for different manufacturers) and / or an autonomous alarm system, with the transmission of information to a central console.

I would also like to note the fact that IP intercom solutions, as a rule, have a video intercom or audio intercom (different manufacturers have different capabilities), that is, the ability to call any of the subscribers without a monthly fee and communication costs.

**- Unlimited number of devices in the system and the distance between them.**

The versatility of the system should be noted, it does not require any special maintenance, and monitors and door entry [entrance panels](https://bas-ip.com/catalog/panels/) can be connected quickly and without any special costs and discomfort for existing users - all thanks to the TPC / IP architecture. And of course, a lot of settings for the user, allowing you to customize the use of the IP intercom for people as much as possible.

**- Ability to remotely control the ip intercom system by the developer or service organization.**

With the help of ip solutions, now, in order to set up or change something in the equipment configuration, it is not necessary to waste time traveling to the object, everything can be done right from the office of the company. So, for example, you can disable or add custom proximity cards without going to the door station, which significantly saves time and money.",u_AleksandrSh,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AleksandrSh/comments/p9y001/advanced_ip_intercom_systems/,,AleksandrSh,p9y001,/r/u_AleksandrSh/comments/p9y001/advanced_ip_intercom_systems/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AleksandrSh/comments/p9y001/advanced_ip_intercom_systems/,0,2021-08-23
A review of the evidence FOR and AGAINST Amado being an Otsutsuki as of chapter 61. You be the judge.,"(at the end, I will briefly discuss some other possibilities, but this post is about two 2 most likely options for what species Amado is).

---------

##The case that Amado is an Otsutsuki:

#1) The way characters *who would be in a position to know his true identity* refer to him

**A)** Isshiki [refers to Momoshiki as a ""sly fox""](https://i.imgur.com/dSjbBWm.jpg) &amp; later [refers to Amado as the same thing](https://i.imgur.com/Lm8TfAb.jpg). These are the only two times he uses that term.

**B** Isshiki draws an implicit contrast between Kashin Koji's *humanity* (his ""human weakness"") and Amado. Notably, In the most recent chapter, [Amado himself draws another such contrast](https://i.imgur.com/eyA4G22.jpg) with the apparent *madness* of ""human love."" 

**C)** In an earlier incident, Jigen and Amado are discussing the urgency of finding a vessel for reincarnation and Jigen implies that Amado [""has time"" as well as ""a choice""](https://i.imgur.com/3Ue8avG.jpg) *unlike Jigen himself*. At the surface level, it could just be Jigen acknowledging is Amado isn't so old he's about to die. It could also point to a deeper mutual understanding between the two.

**D)** Eida is attracted to Kawaki because, as an Otsutsuki, he is one of the very few beings on Earth who could potentially have real feelings for her. When Code brings up Boruto as another potential suitor for the very same reason, Eida [replies](https://i.imgur.com/rHFUsJg.jpg) ""Boruto, right ... he's cute and *dreamy* too, but..."" and then changes the subject. Just couple of panels earlier, Eida uses the same word, ""dreamy,"" [to describe Amado](https://i.imgur.com/Eco4xWp.jpg). The term ""dreamy"" connotes attractiveness in general and is used by Eida to refer to the Otsutsuki boys who are implied to be attractive to her because of that genetic lineage. 


#2) Logic based on Eida's ability to universally attract everyone except Otsutsuki and blood relatives

-I posit that since Eida described Amado as [""a dreamy dandy""](https://i.imgur.com/Eco4xWp.jpg), him being a blood relative of hers is officially ruled out. Of all the potential motifs one might expect to show up in Boruto incest undertones would at the bottom of the list.

Therefore, one of these three must be true: 

**A)** Amado programmed Eida for her ability to work on him; Then proceeded to allow her to be destroyed. These are each unlikely, together they are extremely unlikely.

**B)** Amado is an Otsutsuki.

**C)** Eida was lying about her ability or omitted a crucial part. For example, if Amado ends up being an Artificial Intelligence that simply cannot feel love (or something like that), then Eida omitting that special case would get around what is otherwise a pretty sound logical argument that Amado must be an Otsutsuki.


#3) Amado's hyper-advanced technology.

Technology and science both advance iteratively. Paradigm shifts happen maybe once in a generation, and even those are just clever new ways of synthesizing existing knowledge. Amado's technology to [completely replace a human being with inorganic material](https://i.imgur.com/7OeRsh7.png) in a way that completely supersedes Orochimaru's methods, [to transfer consciousness via circuits in a drone](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Spy_Drone), or to program cyborgs with [perfect clairvoyance](https://i.imgur.com/YSxiQ9D.jpg) or [uno reverse card](https://i.imgur.com/eKlvvL7.jpg) is many generations beyond even the most advanced science we've ever seen in the Narutoverse.

Amado being at this tech level is more consistent with being a millenia-old space alien (or AI) than being a human. In fact, the Chakra fruit even [conveys the full history of a planet's genetic information](https://i.imgur.com/92y6Kks.png) when one consumes it. Eating a few of those might upgrade a being to the point where they can accomplish feats within the range of what we've seen from Amado.

Funny enough, Amado makes what could be a potential slip-up when he describes the process of cultivating chakra fruit as [""endlessly annoying gardening""](https://i.imgur.com/zNslZDd.jpg) üòÇ


#4) Parallels with mythology

Eida/Daemon were introduced as loose [allegories](https://www.reddit.com/r/Boruto/comments/owcm4e/kishimotos_two_newest_characters_are_allegories/) for the deities Amaterasu and Susanoo.

As their creator, Amado could represent the progenitor-God Izanagi.

In fact, there is even some reason to believe that *Delta is Izanami*. To summarize, if Amado tried to bring her back to life as a cyborg but failed resulting in her angry temperament that's kind of similar to [the story of how Izanagi tried to bring Izanami back from the dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izanami#Death_and_the_underworld) but failed and caused her to become chronically enraged; Also, reminiscent of how Izanami was revealed to be a corpse of rotting flesh after spending time in the underworld, and Delta's eye lasers have the special ability to *rot flesh*).

And even crazier, Isshiki's Dojutsu's namesake is the Shinto god ""Sukunahikona,"" known for being [tiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukunabikona) (similar to Issihiki's special ability). The same god also represents a being that [originally came from a far away land](https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sukunabikona.html). Interestingly, Sukunahikona is also [the son of the ULTRA-progenitor god Kamimusubi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamimusubi), so there could arguably be a parallel for Isshiki being some kind of ultra-senior main clan type (son of the Otsutsuki God??) in Boruto.

So anyways, tentatively speaking, Amado is the allegoric embodiment of [primordial creator deity Izanagi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izanagi). Sounds more fitting for someone like that to be one of the race of ""gods"" (Otsutsuki) than human.

---------


##The case that Amado is a human:

#1) He looks human and acts human

Unclear how significant his looks are, given he's already known to be able to completely remodel anyone's body. But he is presented as a human character. The things we've seen him say and do are well within the range of standard human behavior. So if he were an Otsutsuki, he'd have to be one who'd learned to completely disguise his behavior. Is that really likely? 

#2) He refers to Otsutsuki as ""they"" and ""them"" and appears to actively despise them and everything they stand for.

All the Otsutsuki characters we've had in the series so far are super patriotic for their home clan. Supremacist, even. So it would be quite an aberration for this random one disguised as a human to be totally the opposite.

#3) It would be strange for him and Jigen (if Jigen knew) to hide Amado's Otsutsuki identity from the rest of Kara

Unless all the Kara inners (at least some) knew this and just never thought it worth mentioning, Amado was definitely representing himself as a human. Nobody other than Jigen interacts with Amado in a way that suggests they think he's anything other than a genius scientist.

#4) Suddenly revealing Amado as an Otsutsuki would ask a lot more questions than it answers in terms of the plot

Basically, who knew what, and when? And why didn't his secret identity ever explicitly come up between him and Jigen, for example (assuming he knew)? It would just be a massive twist if we were to find this out any time soon, and it would leave a lot of questions to be answered. In order to pull it off, Kishimoto and his editors would have had to make a very detailed plan from the beginning to prevent plot holes. That's a lot of effort for a twist that they might not view as worth it.

It's high-risk to attempt to pull something like this off, too. Executing poorly could end up as another ""Black Zetsu"" situation.

#5) Amado being an Otsutsuki is superfluous

Although I argued above that there are several things that no human backstory could explain, the counterpoint to this is that once those things are explained, which the authors may be able to do quite elegantly, that's that. He doesn't need to be a secret space alien to be good at science anymore. Or to be immune to Eida's dojutsu, etc. 

Nothing else about his character or his thematic importance requires him to be a space alien in disguise. His thematic relevance as a genius scientist could just as well be fulfilled by being a genius *human* scientist, as long as his capabilities are logically justified.


---------

Final notes:

A strong dark horse candidate for Amado's species designation is the **Artificial Intelligence** option (that is, he is natively AI). It would be thematically consistent with the story Boruto is trying to tell about the benefits and dangers of advances in science, and AI is perhaps the most prominent example of this in the modern zeitgeist. However, there is not yet enough evidence to build a substantial case for this.

The other possibility you hear mentioned is that Amado is another *non-Otsutsuki* alien species. This has not been ruled out but has no supporting evidence other than that it is logically plausible.

All About Knee Arthroscopy,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/97yctm48l3j71.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e64ef30c44e8171881d654172024a7cd01d832d9

**What is knee arthroscopy?**

[**Arthroscopy in Delhi**](https://www.theneoorthopaedicclinic.com/arthroscopic-surgery/) is a surgical technique that allows you to directly see the inside of the knee joint and work inside it, without having to open it. Only two small incisions or cuts are made in the skin, about one centimetre each (which is why it is called a mini-invasive technique).

[**Arthroscopy in Delhi**](https://www.theneoorthopaedicclinic.com/arthroscopic-surgery/) is considered the best current technique for meniscal injuries, adhesions, plica, loose bodies, cartilage injuries (chondroplasty) and reconstruction of cruciate ligaments, explains the **orthopaedic in Delhi**.

**How is knee arthroscopy done?**

The [**orthopaedic surgeon in Delhi**](https://www.theneoorthopaedicclinic.com/), in order to see the inside of the joint well and avoid tissue injury with his manoeuvres, fills it with sterile pressure serum, which has the effect of inflating a balloon; and at the same time, it allows continuous joint washing, eliminating blood residues, excised tissue fragments, etc.

The patient lies on his back on the operating table. No system is necessary to pull the joint. You only need to lock the position of the thigh and the surgeon or assistant mobilizes the leg, opening the joint space.

Through an incision, a micro camera is introduced that illuminates and amplifies the interior of the joint, viewing the image on a television monitor. On the other hand, work instruments are introduced, such as probes, hand grippers and motorized smoothing devices.

The anaesthesia used is spinal anaesthesia (patient conscious but asleep from the waist down). Some sedation may be associated with this procedure to be calmer during the surgical act. General anaesthesia is reserved for special cases.

A tourniquet is used on the thigh to prevent bleeding from the knee during the operation, thus promoting vision through the camera.

Although it is a surgical act and requires the same aseptic conditions (cleanliness and sterility to avoid infection) as any other operation, the hospital stay is usually very short. In most cases, the patient can be discharged on the same day, when the anaesthetic effect has worn off. These operations can therefore be included in the program of major outpatient surgery, explains the [**orthopaedic surgeon in Delhi**](https://www.theneoorthopaedicclinic.com/).

**What does** [**knee arthroscopy in Delhi**](https://www.theneoorthopaedicclinic.com/arthroscopic-surgery/) **show?**

* The appearance of **synovial**fluid (viscous fluid that lubricates the joint), which may be cloudy, contain blood or loose bodies, usually cartilage. Synovial fluid can be analysed to determine its composition in special cases.  
‚Ä¢ The **synovial membrane**(the sac that lines the joint inside and produces synovial fluid). In certain cases, a sample (biopsy) is taken for analysis under a microscope.  
‚Ä¢ The **cartilage** that lines the articular surfaces of the femur, tibia, and patella. It is palpated with a special hook to see the consistency and it is observed if it has injuries: wear (osteoarthritis), fissures, chondromalacia ‚Ä¶  
‚Ä¢ The **menisci** (internal and external): observed and palpated with the probe hook. Breaks, tearing, wear are detected ‚Ä¶
* The **cruciate ligaments**(anterior and posterior): they are seen and touched to determine partial or total tears, laxity, function ‚Ä¶ The collateral ligaments are not seen with this technique.  
‚Ä¢ The way the **patella**moves when the knee is bent and stretched, as well as the friction surfaces.

**In which cases should an** [**arthroscopy in Dwarka**](https://www.theneoorthopaedicclinic.com/arthroscopic-surgery/) **be performed?**

Less and less to diagnose, as advances in ultrasound, CT (scanner) and nuclear magnetic resonance resolve it more and more frequently, although they are not infallible. 

However, in cases of doubt or when a major intervention on the knee is planned, an arthroscopy can be performed beforehand, which will make it possible to confirm the diagnosis, rule out other injuries and decide the best possible treatment, which is also sometimes arthroscopic. Thus, in the same surgical act it is diagnosed and treated. In addition, there are patients who have contraindicated MRI (due to claustrophobia, or prosthetic heart valves), in those cases, diagnostic and therapeutic arthroscopy would be indicated by the [**orthopaedic doctor in Delhi**](https://www.theneoorthopaedicclinic.com/orthopaedic-doctor-delhi/).

Another diagnostic utility is to allow a synovial biopsy in certain diseases.

Currently, the main indications for performing a [**knee arthroscopy in Dwarka**](https://www.theneoorthopaedicclinic.com/) are:

* **Meniscal injuries**: remove broken fragments, suture certain tears, regeneration techniques and meniscal reimplantation
* **cruciate ligament reconstruction**: avoid opening the knee as before
* **cartilage injuries**: cleaning, regenerative techniques (**platelet growth factors**, mosaicplasty)
* **removal of intra-articular loose bodies**: fragments of detached cartilage or meniscus
* **removal of synovial plica or synovitis** (synovial membrane hypergrowth)
* **cleaning** on knees with osteoarthritis (wear) before reaching the total knee replacement

**Recommendations at hospital discharge:**  
They are usually quite simple since it is a mini-invasive technique. 

A compression bandage is placed, which the patient will remove at home after 48 hours. Then the first treatment is carried out, which consists of painting the two small wounds with Betadine and covering them with two adhesive dressings. 

From there, the treatment will be repeated every day until the stitches fall out (about 2 to 4 weeks). It can be made to coincide with the shower as long as two rules are met:

* quick shower: the less time the wounds are wet the better
* WITH the dressings on: so that soap, shampoo, dirty water do not get into the wounds

After showering, the wet dressings are removed, the wounds are thoroughly dried with sterile gauze, painted with Betadine, and new dressings are placed.

From the moment the mobility of the legs recovers after anaesthesia, it is advisable to start walking. At first helped with crutches and following the indications of your [**orthopaedic surgeon in Dwarka**](https://www.theneoorthopaedicclinic.com/) regarding load (partial or complete). Usually, the patient leaves the hospital the same day walking with the help of two crutches.

An anti-inflammatory treatment is usually recommended at discharge for the first days.

It is advisable to apply ice locally for 10-15 minutes about 3-4 times a day to help reduce inflammation.

Depending on the diagnosis and treatment carried out, a specific [**physiotherapy**](http://drsarwarphysiotherapycenter.com/) may or may not be prescribed, with the recovery times greatly varying. The time in which you can return to sports or hard work depends on the injury: from 1 month to several months.

In the event of residual effusion (usually due to the persistence of the arthroscopic lavage fluid and more rarely due to bleeding into the joint, which is the hemarthros), an evacuating puncture may be necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãthe area is punctured, and the excess fluid is extracted with a syringe. This procedure should only be performed by an [**orthopaedic surgeon in Delhi**](https://www.theneoorthopaedicclinic.com/).",u_neoorthopaedics,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_neoorthopaedics/comments/p9ye52/all_about_knee_arthroscopy/,,neoorthopaedics,p9ye52,/r/u_neoorthopaedics/comments/p9ye52/all_about_knee_arthroscopy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_neoorthopaedics/comments/p9ye52/all_about_knee_arthroscopy/,0,2021-08-23

1: NO MINORS, as long as you‚Äôre over 18 age is just a number to me. I myself am 23. 

2: Be open! Be open to exploring and trying things you‚Äôve never done before. I want partners who can bring things to the table to make the story better, and to put in equal effort. I love when both me and my partner are equally happy with the storyline! This doesn‚Äôt mean we cant have boundaries though, I will 100% respect your boundaries and in return I‚Äôd like you to respect mine. 

3: REALISTIC FACE CLAIMS ONLY!! With the small exception of if the artwork looks realistic enough I‚Äôm totally okay with it. 

4: I personally have a bipolar schedule, so I may not respond as frequently as I want to. I‚Äôd like to try and respond at least once a day but sometimes it could be once every four days. Please be okay with this. 

5: 3RD PERSON ONLY, I only write in third person, i feel uncomfortable with anything else. 

6: I prefer to role play on discord but if I‚Äôm interested I don't mind rping on kik. 

7: I expect 2-3 paragraphs normally, and at the least I want one paragraph. I prefer quality over quantity. I myself can range from semi-lit to novella depending on the situation and my partner‚Äôs preference. 

Now onto the prompts! 

Tootsie &amp; her kidnaper [F4A]
Tootsie is a 19 year old woman who works at her father‚Äôs candy store. She‚Äôs a short, chubby, sweetheart and what she‚Äôs known for is her afro that covers her eyes and her bubbly personality. Her sweetness ended up attracting the town‚Äôs serial killer who just so happened to have a sweet-tooth. They became a regular at her shop, they stalked her on social media, they followed her home, took pictures of her when she was out and about the city, they were obsessed with her. *They* were also responsible for the handful of girls who had gone missing over the past couple of months. So when the time came for a new victim, Tootsie was just what they had in mind. And what is she going to do when she wakes up to find herself tied up in the killer‚Äôs house? 

So that‚Äôs basically it! We can add more onto it if we‚Äôd like! I‚Äôm open to both FF, FM, and even F and non-binary pairings. I don‚Äôt mind if your character is trans but if so I‚Äôd prefer if they were at least half-way transitioned, whether it‚Äôs top or bottom surgery is up to you! I was thinking this could take place around the mid/late 80s or in modern times, it‚Äôs up to us really. Also I would be playing Tootsie if that wasn't already clear. 

Just a side note, I understand this is a dark prompt, but I do have limits which I will tell you about in DM‚Äôs, and if you have some yourselfI will 100% respect them!

You Are Now an Investor.,"Well hello world üíñ 

Okay ladies no shade, but how do we except to be ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù then men when American men have convinced American women that getting coffee or going on walks are dates. This doesn‚Äôt seem like a good investment to me. So let me understand. 

We spend $60 on nails, $6 on eyeliner, $28 on an eyeshadow palette, $3 on concealer, $4 on blush, $7 on mascara, $6 on contour, $6 on foundation, $4 on highlighter, $20 on brushes, $$$ on hair and outfits, etc. 

On top of that, we get harassed on public transportation to go to work, we get harassed at work, and we get harassed on the way home from work. Men work collectively to to make sure women don‚Äôt make the same amount of money as them. It seems like men value money more than women. I mean we don‚Äôt even have mandated paid maternity leave. We also get fired if we speak up about discrimination in the workplace and we are less likely to be promoted. The emotional torture just to get a paycheck that isn‚Äôt even remotely close to the amount men make.  

The same men that say hiring applicants should be based off of good work ethic regardless of race or gender are the same men that try to molest you at work. 

All for what? A $4.00 cup of coffee? This seems more like a business meeting. 

A walk around the park as a date? What are we dogs? Are you a dog? Woof woof here‚Äôs a biscuit, bitch. 

No, we are not dogs. 

We are human beings.

[F4M] A woman fucking much older men on her vacation! (light hearted roleplay),"**Post is still open! Please read the whole post!**

Hey there!

Today, I'm looking to play a roleplay focusing on the large age gap between a younger woman and a much older man!

This scenario will be taking place at a sunny vacation resort with long beaches, palm trees and of course a cozy hotel! The roleplay itself will take place in the hotel itself where our characters can meet up at the small pool area bar, the restaurant on the ground floor, or when out for a walk close by. I do prefer it to not be a beach scenario, as I like the characters to be a bit more clothed at first, to not show off too much from the start!

She'll be a young woman, aged 20-25 years old, a somewhat regular college girl who managed to get away on a vacation this year, traveling alone. This gives her all the freedom she wants, no other people to schedule her vacation around. This also gives her the freedom to test out a couple of things she would most likely be judged for with her friends around, which is meeting up and have sex with men waaay older than her! It's been something she's been wanting to try out for a while, but haven't had a good chance to do it discretely in her home town. 

As for her personality, she'll be rather casual and easy going, not looking for any big romance, or any wild mindless sex, she just wants to have fun, hang ut with an old man, get to test out what sex is like with that age contrast and body contrast as well. When it comes to her looks, I like to discuss that when we're setting the roleplay up, though I like her to be a more everyday looking girl, rather than some model or porn star

Him on the other side, is also a rather regular person, a bit older at 65-75 years old. He's on his yearly vacation with his old wife as they enjoy the smaller slower resorts, not much happening so they can really enjoy the weather and relax. As for his body, he's got a regular dad bod with a little bit of belly etc, but nothing extreme in any way there. The cock would be of normal size as well, maybe a bit of a grower in his old age! As for his personality, I like him to be kind of open minded and relaxed as well. He's happily married, but won't turn down the chance to spice things out a little bit on a vacation, especially with a younger woman, and as long as his wife don't find out.

As for the scenario itself, I like them running into each other spontaneously. His wife could be a bit tired and head off to their room to get some rest, leaving him able to chat with her discretely. A good place to start could be her sitting down at the bar relaxing when he arrives there as well, and they start to talk from there. I'd love this to not be rushed, with some build up etc, rather than them jumping straight into fucking. If both are casual enough, they could talk about sex in an open way, and decide to try some things out as well at her room after that. I'm open for other ideas as well, but I prefer this kind of normal way to meet up!

As most roleplays includes a lot of flirting and the characters playing games, using inuendos etc, I'd like to not do that for this roleplay, as I love them to be able to talk openly and honestly about this, not needing to play around or flirting. During the sex, I also like this to continue, making them have some fun and chat etc, just so it's not mindless fucking. I've been in a lot of roleplays where the characters are having fun, and then suddenly when the sex starts, they lose all their personality and it's just wild moaning and humping. I don't want that in this roleplay, as I think their interaction shouldn't get lost when the sex starts :)

Overall, I like this roleplay to be fun and light hearted, leaving out dark or abusive themes.

* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, clothed sex, casual sex, age contrast, body contrast, everyday people
* **Limits:** Toilet stuff, impregnation, violence, abuse, male anal, squirting, deepthroat, rough sex, people controlling my character in the roleplay, dominance

So, I hope you like the idea for this roleplay and the theme! I only roleplay this in Reddit Pm:s though, so please **don't use the chat** and don't suggest other mediums to play in. I'm also looking for more detailed roleplayers for this, and don't require walls of text, but please no one liner responses or very low effort ones. 

To make it a bit easier to see what you're into and your thoughts for this roleplay, please send the response and answer the following questions in the initial response:

* What are your thoughts on the theme and the scenario?
* What are your kinks, that don't conflict with my limits or the light hearted theme?
* What are your limits?
* Are you open to play this out now as a rapid response roleplay?
* Are you open for playing this roleplay out with the roles reversed, with you playing as the younger woman and me as the older man?
* Are you open for her being a more everyday looking woman, rather than porn star or model etc? Also open for some rule34 themed characters for her :)

That should be about it! Again, answer th questions above in your initial response, as it helps me a lot to see fromt he start what you're into and open for. While I like to chat with people, it gets very messy if I've got to go through introductions with a lot of people just to find out whether we're looking for the same thing, plus, it's really good to have it all in one place and easy to find if I need to check back on the kinks and thoughts during the roleplay.

As phone app users seem to often have problems finidng the PM:s and often use the chat anyway, please use [this link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=roleplay_emelie) to send a PM to me. 

Hope to hear from you!

"[F4M]Mom fucks her sons anthro bully! (light hearted roleplay, anthro on human)","**The post is still open! Please read the whole post!**

Hey!

Today, I'm looking to play out a roleplay scenario where a bully gets to have sex with the mom of the guy he's bullying, focusing on some themes like anthro on human, light cum inflation, and light hearted sex.

He'll be an anthro in this roleplay, which means a humanoid animal, walking on two legs, mentally human, animal genitalia, fur, and other features as well, so not just a guy with cat ears or anything! He'd be a wolf, fox or similar species, but open for ideas when we're setting the roleplay up as well. 

He's 19-22 years old, tall, strong, large cock, and other bodily features fitting for a bully, who's also very popular with the girls. Some girls like bad boys, and he's certainly one of them! He's been bullying one specific guy for a while, and has plans to go even further, as he's got his aim for his mom. What would be the ultimate victory over him, if not to fuck his mom, and having her be fully into it? Being an anthro also have a couple of other nice features, like being able to cum reeeally large loads, able to fuck her for a long time, filling her up with cum. Sure, he can't interbreed with humans, but that don't stop him from having some fun! He's a very confident guy, knowing there's not much the guys he's bullying can do back to him, being the stronger one.

She on the other hand, is a 40 year old single mom, still looking good, a nice and fun mom, who is still sexually active and experienced, always open for new ideas. She is one of those women who are into bad boys a little bit, so instead of doing the reasonable thing and scold the bully, she actually finds him very attractive and is nice and inviting to him. Sure she won't win the mom of the year award, but at least she gets to have som fun! We can discuss her exact looks in the setup of the roleplay. I prefer her to not be shy or submissive in any way in the roleplay. She might need a little bit of a push to go through with it fully, but nothing much, and nothing forced! 

As for the scenario itself: The bully has planned this day out for a while, waiting for the perfect time to set the plans in motion. Knowing that the guy he's bullying is out of town over the weekend, and that his mom is home alone, he decides to come over. He'll knock on the door, as she opens, actually glad to see him, as she don't have to pretend to be mad at him when the son isn't around, so they start to hang out, chatting and eventually taking it in a sexual direction. For him to just hang out with the mom is a power move in itself, but by also having sex with her, he's claiming his vistory for real, staying the whole evening, making sure to do everything with her!

When in private with her, he won't act as a bully to her, as he has no reason to. I like him to still be confident etc, but he won't force her to do anything, or not abuse her in any way. He won't have to, as she's in on it! As for her motivations, liking bad guys, what better bad guy would there be, than the guy who bullies her son? The guy who's clearly the strongest and biggest guy around! And, by having sex with him, he only gets more powerful over the guys he bully, so for her, that only makes him even more bad and more interesting! She do like a confident guy after all, and this would do even more for his already big ego.

As for the theme, I want this to still be a light hearted theme, even if there are some darker components in it. To make sure we don't go any dark directions, I don't want us to go into details about the bullying itself or what he has done to the son, we'll leave it as just general bullying. This also isn't a cuck scene, so the son won't be around in the scene at all, as he's out of town. 

As for the sex itself, I do like some build up, taking things a bit slow, to not just rush to the sex. They start by hanging out, chatting and then take things further and further, while still having fun and chatting etc. I din't want this to turn into wild humping, and mindless fucking, as I do enjoy their interactions! And, even if he's a big strong bully, I don't want the sex itself to be rough or abusive. He's big, so he needs to be careful with her after all! He don't need to be dominant towards her, as he's got natural good confidence instead

One kink I'd really love to try out and explore for this would be cum inflation as well. Humans and anthros can't interbreed, but I'd like him to be able to really fill her up with cum, to the point of her looking like she's fully pregnant when he's done. This would be painless for her, and might take a little bit of time, if he can continually cum when fucking her, filling her up good.

* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, clothed sex, casual sex, build up, cum inflation, age contrast
* **Limits:** Toilet stuff, impregnation, violence, abuse, male anal, spanking, deepthroat, rough sex, squirting, dominance

So, that should be about it! I hope you liked this idea, and if you're interested in playing it out, please send a PM with your response. I do have alist of questions I'd like you to answer, to give me a good idea from the start oif what you're into and what you are open for. Please answer all of them in the initial response, as it makes things easier for meto go fback and find it during the roleplay:

* Describe a little bit of what you like about the theme and the scenario itself
* Your kinks(that don't go against my limits)
* Your limits
* If you're able to play now as a rapid response rolelay
* If you're ok with her being a more everyday looking woman, rather thanpornstar or model etc
* If you'd be into reversing the roles for this scene, with you playing as the mom, and me as the male anthro bully

Please make sure to answer all of the things above, and show me that you're serious about reading and writing here :) I do get a lot of one liner responses or people who barely read the post, and that won't really work for me. I don't expect any huge walls of text or anything, but at least show me that you're serious and enthusiastic about this.

I also only roleplay using Reddit Pm:s so please **don't use the chat** when contacting me, and don't ask me for discord, kik or other roleplay mediums. To send a PM to me, [here is a link to send a PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=roleplay_emelie) , especially for the app users, as the app seems to default to using the chat. So again, make sure to send a PM with your full response to what I ask above.

New Zealand home design," Looking to refresh your home design and decor in the new year? While the home has been the safest sanctuary in 2020, staring at the same four walls can undeniably get a little boring.

From rethinking how a home layout should be, to incorporating organic shapes and archways, read on to get inspired by the home interior design trends of 2021!

Following are some[ home design ideas in New Zealand.](https://www.hdcontractor.co.nz/)

**Embrace Nostalgia &amp; Traditionalism**

This trend is a huge contrast to the all-white and minimalistic homes you see on the internet. Grandmillennial style is a great way for young homeowners to showcase their individuality and uniqueness. Having old and traditional pieces immediately makes your home feel lived in and welcoming.

**Bring In the Outdoors**

This is not a new design trend but it‚Äôs very relevant to our current situation. As you aren‚Äôt leaving our houses as often as used to, it‚Äôs a wise choice to bring the outdoors indoors. Houseplants are a great way to inject some greenery into your homes ‚Äì they‚Äôll create a soothing effect on yourself, especially after a long and stressful day of work.

There are plenty of health benefits: medical studies have shown that houseplants can improve your mood, reduce tiredness, and stress and improve your focus.

**Say Goodbye to Open Floor Plans**

Home is now more than that ‚Äì it‚Äôs the place where we do everything, from working to exercising and socializing. In addition to that, most of your family members are staying in for work and school so the need for privacy is evident. To provide them with privacy, demarcate spaces in your home so that everyone has their own space.

You don‚Äôt need to do a full home renovation to build up your walls and demarcate space. Try adding a screen divider, curtain, or even a bookshelf ‚Äì they create separation in your home to give your family members the privacy they need.

**Incorporate Natural Elements**

Integrating natural elements into your home are the perfect way to bring texture, warmth, and lightness into your home. They are a great contrast piece if you have more contemporary pieces such as marble, leather, and gold accents at home.

You can incorporate this interior design trend into your home through throw pillows, furniture, rugs, and baskets. Take a bold step forward and mix and match different textures ‚Äì having contrasting textures creates a unique and visual-rich space.

**Use Earthy Colors to Add Warmth**

A key interior trend for 2021 is incorporating warm colors into your home. Warm-toned colors such as terra cotta, browns, and beiges are popular color choices. These nature-inspired colors give your home a sense of peace and tranquility where you can relax and recharge after a long day of work.

**Organic Shapes &amp; Archways**

No more modular and rectangular shapes dominating your home ‚Äì try incorporating organic shapes with rounded furniture such as ottomans, coffee table,s or even sofas. Organic shapes are a great way to evoke a softer and more relaxed feel into your home. It‚Äôs also a great way to enhance the human connection to nature and creativity.

If you don‚Äôt have the luxury of space to buy new furniture, you can hang up wall art that features soft lines (e.g., face line art) or sculptural decor pieces that are soft and abstract.",u_HDCONTRACTORLIMITED,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HDCONTRACTORLIMITED/comments/p9vbwm/new_zealand_home_design/,,HDCONTRACTORLIMITED,p9vbwm,/r/u_HDCONTRACTORLIMITED/comments/p9vbwm/new_zealand_home_design/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HDCONTRACTORLIMITED/comments/p9vbwm/new_zealand_home_design/,0,2021-08-23
A Coward's Grave,"*This is around 3,600 words, bit longer than usual. Enjoy!*

Aurelio shivered as a cool breeze bearing the putrid smell of the war swirled through his dank cell. He clutched the thin blanket the jailers had grudgingly given him, pulling it tighter around his huge frame. With the shortages, they weren‚Äôt going to waste a good blanket on a prisoner.

*Especially not to a coward,* he thought.

A group of soldiers came to the door and opened it with a jangle of keys. They leveled their rifles at Aurelio and his cellmate; when he met their eyes, he saw nothing but disgust, hatred even. He knew they wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to shoot either of them. If anything, they‚Äôd be eager to. More rations for the soldiers actually willing to fight.

Aurelio raised his hands slowly and let the blanket fall to the ground, steadily meeting the soldier‚Äôs eyes. His cellmate scurried to the corner, whimpering, wide eyed and frenzied. His body had survived the war, but his mind hadn't come back from the battlefield.

The lead soldier smirked maliciously, and pointed past Aurelio. ‚ÄúMight as well get rid of that one. At least this other chickenshit is quiet.‚Äù 

The man screamed, begging for his life, his freedom, as the two soldiers grabbed him by the upper arms. The pungent smell of urine filled the chamber, the last defense of all dying animals. As they drug him kicking and screaming to the door, one of the soldiers finally let him go. He immediately fell back down, cowering.

He stared at the prisoner in disgust, ‚ÄúHe *pissed* himself, sarg. Fucking *pissed* himself.‚Äù

With that said, the soldier brought the butt of his rifle down into the man‚Äôs face. The *crack* as it ruined the mouth hidden in the prisoner's patchy beard was punctuated by a flash of crimson and white. Grisly shooting stars spattered Aurelio‚Äôs face as the man‚Äôs shattered teeth ricocheted across the cell.

Aurelio dropped to his belly with his hands over his head as the other prisoner grasped at his face, keening like a dying animal as the pain penetrated his panic. The two soldier‚Äôs kicked the man several times before they drug him limply to his feet, while their sergeant watched on.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt even got any house training, sarg, just fucking animals. Might as well put a bullet in their brain pan,‚Äù the soldier that had struck the prisoner said, panting in exertion as they drug the unconscious- *dead?-* man to the doorway.

The sergeant stared down at Aurelio for a few moments before he spit on Aurelio and said, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll all be getting a coward‚Äôs grave. Every single one of them. No point in rushing it.‚Äù

Aurelio stayed on the ground, trying his best not to move, not to *breathe*, until the soldiers had drug their burden out of the room and disappeared down the hall. As high as tensions were in the barracks, he knew a wrong move could easily get him killed. 

As they finally went around the corner Aurelio slowly rose to his feet, shaking, ready to drop if they returned. After a few moments he finally started trying to brush the other prisoner‚Äôs urine off of his dirty fatigues; the pungent stuff had trickled under him while he waited for the soldiers to leave, he hadn‚Äôt been able to avoid it without risking their anger. Aurelio finally sighed and gave up, taking the blanket the other man had left behind and rubbing it off his skin and clothes the best he could. He couldn‚Äôt smell it anymore anyways.

Aurelio slid down to the floor and leaned his back against the barred door, trying to pick up any hint of what was happening around the corner. With every able body being needed on the frontlines, the base was almost deserted. He could hear murmurs from the trial he knew was happening, punctuated by loud sobs and the occasional wail, but nothing coherent.

Finally, Aurelio hung his head and did what soldiers do best; he hurried up and waited. He knew his turn was coming shortly, and he suspected he wouldn't get off this time. The war was ramping up, and Aurelio wouldn't have been surprised to be told that the infected outnumbered humanity at this point. Everybody had to do their part, or they were just dead weight.

Aurelio jerked out of his half sleep as he heard a door slam open down the hall. He heard the tromp of soldier boots as they walked towards him, and he darted to the back of his cell. The two soldiers dragged his former cellmate down the hall between them while he gibbered and wept.

The prisoner kicked and screamed to no avail. ""Please, *please*, I can do better! I'll fight, I really will! I swear. I won't run again! Please, *please* don't do this!*""*

As they passed Aurelio's cell, the closest soldier slammed his baton into the barred door and said, ""Got to take this garbage out back to his coward's grave. You're next, chickenshit.""

Aurelio sat in his cell, shaking, trying to keep the tears from coming. He knew that his fellow soldiers wouldn't have any mercy regardless, and he didn't want to give them the satisfaction. He gave a bitter smile, and acted like a good soldier; he embraced the suck, and relaxed the best he could.

After about a half hour, the soldiers came back. Their sergeant was with them, watching. Aurelio could tell the men were on edge; he'd seen it before. Killing wasn't easy on the mind, even if you weren't a coward.

As they came into the cell, the soldier that had smashed in the other prisoner's face kicked Aurelio's boots. ""Get up, fucker. I told you you were next.""

Aurelio slowly rose to his feet, his hands raised, open. The soldiers tightened their grips on their rifles as he did; he knew his size was intimidating, especially when they probably knew about the training he'd had, the experience. Aurelio didn't give them any reason to use their guns, he simply put his wrists together in front of him.

The soldiers warily cuffed him while the sergeant watched. Once they had him restrained they roughly pushed him out of the cell and down the hallway. Aurelio didn't resist; he knew it was pointless. He simply went as they prodded.

Their destination was a short walk down the hallway. The soldiers guided Aurelio through a door and sat him at a cheap brown table; the metal folding chair he found himself in was cold through his fatigues.

A trio of senior officers faced him across the room, sat at their own cheap table. Their eyes were coldly focused on him, analyzing him, in a way that made the chair seem warm. The soldiers took their place behind Aurelio, near enough to restrain him if need be.

""Identify yourself for the records,"" said the central officer, her voice curt, full of disdain.

Aurelio straightened his shoulders and said, ""Captain Aurelio Green, of the 75th Airborne, mam.""

The woman looked over the file in front of her- *his file*\- flipping through page after page. ""Your case isn't as cut and dry as the filth that came in before you, captain. He was just another draftee that couldn't cope. You though.. You were at the Afro-Asian Event, no? *And* the first Emergence?""

Aurelio stared at her steadily as she looked through the file and replied simply, ""Yes mam. I served all through the Event; Cairo, Istanbul. I was even in Seoul, during the final push.""

She finally closed the folder and met Aurelio's gaze. ""And yet, you're here accused of cowardice, of a moral dereliction of duty. Not once, but twice, after the first issue was smoothed over.""

She paused for effect before finishing. ""We both know, captain, that desertion in a time of war can lead to a death sentence. Especially in *this* war. We can't afford to house prisoners, or to let you end up infected.""

Aurelio simply nodded, ""Yes mam, I understand the situation.""

The woman paused and conferred with men that flanked her before turning back to Aurelio. ""With your experience and training, you could still be a valuable asset, captain. Frankly, we're losing this war. It's barely been six months since the freaks made their Emergence from the sea-based synth farms. We not only lost our 'ethical meat substitute', which is causing widespread risk of starvation, but we discovered an enemy that is driving us back in a way we've never dealt with.""

""Between the freaks and the people infected by the corrupted synthmeat, we are being overrun. Why don't you tell us what happened? Give us a chance to let you go back to honorable service?""

Aurelio swallowed hard and looked down at the table for a few moments before he responded. ""The first time.. I was sent to southeast Texas during the evac of Houston. Houston's my home, or.. it was. Before the Emergence.""

Taking a deep breath he continued, ""We were in Houston, sweeping up swarms of infected as best we could. We killed *so many*, mam. So many. They just didn't stop. You know how it is with them, but.. it had just started then. We were fresh, and.. It wss bloody, dirty work.""

""We were near the neighborhood where my family lived. The.. The Heights. It's beautiful. It was. Just doing our jobs. Doing our duty. We all knew our families had been evacced first; family of military personnel had priority early on. I wasn't worried, but.. I was *home.*""

""My squad and I, we were clearing out this massive store, an H-E-B. It's a Texas thing. The infected were everywhere, devouring everything. They were doing what they do, and my men and I were doing what we did. Clearing them out.""

""We exited into a parking garage that serviced the building and ran into a small swarm trying to get in. No big deal. Circle, disorient, neutralize. That's the method.""

The frowning officer simply motioned for him to continue.

Aurelio stared past the committee, remembering. Once he was ready, he said, ""I saw her in the swarm. I couldn't miss her. I'd been married to her for a decade. That soft brown skin. The beautiful face. My two year old daughter was with her, riding in her carrier on her chest.""

""They were both infected. Eyes bloody, minds gone. My wife. My daughter. And my team tried to kill them. I.. reacted.""

The officer stepped in, ""You seriously injured two of your men that day, captain, is that correct?""

Aurelio closed his eyes and whispered, ""Yes. I.. lost it. I didn't have any idea, no warning. I thought my family was safe; all of us on the ground did. I didn't find out that the evacs failed, the birds never made it in, until later.""

Looking up he continued. ""My men restrained me; it was obvious what was going on. My squad leader knew Victoria. He'd been at Isi's baptism. He saw her, he knew. I'm sure he suspected the worst for his own family, and he was right.""

""They got me down, and then they neutralized the swarm. They left Victoria, Isi, for me. We were brothers; my family was their family, they knew I had to do it. *Needed* to.""

""They held her down; little Isi was strapped into her baby carrier too tight to do anything. They just.. They screamed at me. Eyes full of blood, lungs full of hate. They screamed and they bit and they fought. The words.. Isi couldn't even talk yet, but she did. Something was using them, like it does all the infected. Trying to communicate.""

Aurelio closed his eyes again and let out a single sob, the tears running down his face. Staring at the table, he finished. ""I did what had to be done. I ended it, and we got the hell out of there. I faced a committee just like this afterwards, and was absolved.""

The head of the committee shook her head stiffly. ""I'm aware, captain, and for what it's worth, I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sorry for *all* of our losses, but it doesn't change what happened.""

One of the other men spoke into the silence, ""Let's hear about the newest incident and get this over.""

Aurelio nodded stiffly. ""That was two months ago. A month afterwards, I was pulled off of leave. The war was going badly; *is* going badly, they needed my services.""

He met their gaze. ""I've served for a *decade,* mam. I *volunteered* right before the Event. I.. I'm not a coward. I'm not.""

The female officer shook her head dismissively, ""Then tell us what happened, captain! You got ten soldiers killed! *Killed* by your actions. Explain it to us.""

Aurelio stared down at the table. ""I was sent to New Orleans, there was a new Emergence from the offshore farms coming in. Everything was fine. We drove through multiple freaks, no issues.""

""Then we ran into a swarm, a *big* swarm, mam. *Huge*. The thing is.. The freaks, they don't look human anymore. They're just.. *things*. Big, nasty, brutal *things,* monsters.""

""When that swarm came at us us, it shouldn't have been a big deal. *Circle, disorient, neutralize.* That's the work. That's what we *do*.""

""But.. Mam. When they closed on us.. It was my wife, carrying my dead baby. All of them. Victoria in the grey suit. Victoria wearing the black dress. Victoria in the pink sweat pants.""

""Victoria, screaming at me. Isi, screaming at me. Over and over and over. All of them. Everywhere I looked.""

Aurelio looked down at the table again. ""I froze, sir. I.. couldn't do it. I'd killed them once. My wife. My baby. I *couldn't* do it.""

""When I froze, it threw the whole operation off. The swarm almost overran us. I barely got out. I don't know why they even drug me out. They should have let me die.""

The commanding officer motioned for him to continue, ""And did this behavior continue, captain?""

""It did, mam. I.. Tried multiple times over our four day deployment. I just.. I freeze. I see my Victoria, my Isi, and.. I just can't do it anymore. I can't. I *won't.*""

The lead officer again conferred with her fellow committee members. Their whispered conversation went on for several moments before she finally turned back to Aurelio.

""Unfortunately, captain Green, the circumstances we have been placed in don't leave us much room for leniency. Your situation is tragic, but that means nothing against the war effort. Tragedy is everywhere.""

Aurelio simply nodded, and quietly said, ""I understand, mam.""

The officer shook her head sadly and said, ""Captain Green, this tribunal finds you guilty of a dereliction of duty, of cowardice in the face of the enemy. Due to the war effort and the supply shortages, it isn't feasible to hold you as a prisoner.""

She met Aurelio's eyes steadily as she finished issuing her judgment. ""This tribunal hereby sentences you to death. May you serve us this one last time with your sacrifice, and may you find the peace you are searching for.""

Aurelio closed his eyes and slowly blew out his breath as the soldier's roughly seized him, jerking him to his feet. He had known what the verdict would be, and took solace in the fact that it would soon be over.

The men walked Aurelio out of the small room and down the hallway. Aurelio took one last glance at the cell he'd spent the final two weeks of his life in, and then they were past it, headed deeper into the compound. He knew where the soldiers usually carried out executions, and the men were dragging him towards it.

One of the guards chuckled darkly as they exited the building and said, ""I told you you'd be getting the same thing as your friend. You fucking cowards don't deserve any better.""

Aurelio just continued marching in the pouring rain, trying not to stumble in the dank mud. He was already dead, there wasn't any reason to antagonize them. If they decided to shoot him in the spine 'accidentally' and leave him to suffer, there wouldn't be any consequences. Better to let them talk, and die clean.

To his surprise, they led him back into a large building at the rear of the military complex rather than to the pit the local forces had been using as a body dump. He'd never been in the building, but he thought it was a medical suite of some kind.

The soldiers drug him into a pristinely clean room with multiple beds laid out in neat rows. His cellmate lay on one of the beds, eyes closed, unbreathing. The grime and stench that covered Aurelio was suddenly overwhelming when compared to the medbay.

A medical officer dressed in fatigues approached them, taking a stack of papers from one of Aurelio's escorts. ""Got another one, eh? Do we need to strap you down, or will you take it like a man? Never know with your kind.""

Aurelio cautiously answered, ""Take what, sir?""

One of the guards cuffed him in the ear, setting it to ringing. ""Don't be smart, fucker.""

The medical officer raised his hand to stop the soldier and said, ""We aren't monsters, even if you're a coward. Plus, we don't waste bullets if we don't have to. I'll give you a shot, part paralytic, part pain killer, and you'll drift off peacefully.""

Staring Aurelio in the eye he finished, ""Or we can do it the hard way and the boys can take you to the latrine and bash your skull in. Your choice.""

Aurelio looked into the man's eyes steadily, calmly, and said, ""A shot sounds just fine, sir.""

With that said, the medical officer directed the soldiers to help him lay down on one of the beds. Once he was down, the officer drew out a syringe full of a clear liquid and unceremoniously plunged it into Aurelio's neck. Aurelio felt his body shutting down almost immediately as the medication poured through his veins.

As he drifted off into the darkness, one of the soldiers leaned down and whispered in his ear, ""You fucking rangers think you're hot shit, so much better than the rest of us. You think it matters that you walked here like a man instead of being drug like your cellmate?""

""They sentenced you to *death*, fucker, but they didn't discharge you. You still got work to put in.""

""You're just gonna be meat machine, fucker. A processor, data storage. Don't worry though, they' keeping your body nice and warm back in the messhall; about four hundred degrees from what I heard.""

Aurelio tried to focus, to ask the man what he meant, but the drugs were too strong. His mind finally blacked out, giving into whatever cocktail they'd shoved in his body.

An eternity later, Aurelio woke up. It was still dark, and he still couldn't move, but at least he wasn't dead. At first, he thought the medtech had made a mistake, kept the dose too low, probably trying to ration it.

Trying not to let panic *or* exhilaration cloud his thinking, Aurelio focused on his body, trying to force it to respond, to overcome the medication, but.. He couldn't. He couldn't even *feel* it, much less move. All he could do was float in the darkness, and wait. 

Just as he was starting to give into the panic, someone spoke directly into his ear. ""UA-2, turn your weapon systems on; I repeat, activate primary weapon systems. Deploy *now!*""

As soon as the voice spoke, Aurelio could see; he didn't open his eyes, because he still couldn't feel his body, but suddenly it was like a screen turned on, and he could see. He was in some ruined city, in the middle of a group of rangers wearing their standard reinforced exoskeleton body armor.

A soldier walked over to him with a thick permanent marker in his hand and jerked Aurelio's head down. He couldn't resist it, he couldn't feel anything, move anything. The man hurriedly scrawled *COWARD* across his view screen; the letters were backwards from Aurelio's point of view, as if they'd been written on a window he was looking through.

The ranger laughed and said, ""I hope you're ready, coward. Big fucking swarm coming, and we got work to do.""

Aurelio watched in horror as he moved without his volition, a passenger inside his own body, bringing up two armored mechanical arms and running through a rapid systems check of the heavy weapons mounted on them. He tried to stop the body, to say something, to scream, but it didn't respond to his commands at all.

He watched as the soldiers formed a perimeter, obviously expecting combat. The first contact came behind him, the high pitched keening of the infected echoing in his ears strangely; he finally realized it was because he had multiple microphones picking up sound now, rather than ears.

As his body turned, Aurelio saw the first wave of the infected break on the ranger's barricades. Each one had the face of his dead wife, each one carried a tiny screaming body on their chest. He watched as the ranger's mowed them down, killing them, destroying them.

When his own body started forward with a foreign rolling gait, Aurelio resisted with every fiber of his body. It did nothing.

When his body raised his arms with the heavy machine guns mounted on them, Aurelio frenziedly fought against it. It did nothing.

When the guns mounted on his wrists erupted, destroying body after body, replica after replica of his dead wife, Aurelio silently screamed, and screamed, and screamed inside his coward's grave.

It did nothing.",scarystories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/p9ve8q/a_cowards_grave/,,gheistling,p9ve8q,/r/scarystories/comments/p9ve8q/a_cowards_grave/,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/p9ve8q/a_cowards_grave/,0,2021-08-23

"I have recently become the guardian of my sister with bpd, looking for advice","My 17 year old sister moved in with me and my partner a few months ago. I‚Äôve been trying to get guardianship from my parents for a few years now, because the home life has been extremely chaotic and unhealthy (for everybody). 
She had a suicide attempt earlier this year and that was what finally allowed my parents to let her live with me. 
She is adopted and my parents are emotionally abusive to all the kids, but she has gotten the worst in my opinion.

I am a bit older than her and so we never got super close since I left home when she was still pretty young. That‚Äôs part of my reasoning in wanting her to move, so I can protect her since I wasn‚Äôt there before. 

It‚Äôs been pretty easy since she got here overall. There‚Äôs been a few days where something really upsets her or throws her into a mood, but nothing that‚Äôs been directed at me. 

Today however, a lot changed.. 
She has an online friend who has recently been sending her expensive gifts and was planning to come to town while my partner and I are going to be gone. This friend had apparently already bought my sister a ticket to a theme park on one of the days I am out of town. 
She really likes this friend, and unlike anybody else she knows, I‚Äôve never heard my sister say something bad or negative about her. 

I asked my sister if we could get dinner with her and her mom (who is supposedly coming as well) while they‚Äôre in town. She said yes and seemed really excited but I was an idiot and explained that I wanted to make sure they seemed normal and not like.. traffickers or something. 
She ended up getting really mad at me and going in her room. 

She came out again later and wanted help with her homework, but would get extremely mad at me when I wouldn‚Äôt just do it for her. I was really calm and patient. She told me she would pay me to do it. I said no, but I would helped her. She would then storm off into her room and then repeat it a few times. She kept saying she was dumb or stupid and protecting that I was acting like I felt that way too. 
She ended up calling my parents and making sure I could hear, saying I was a bully and mean. She also texted our other sibling saying that I‚Äôm the same as our parents and she hates living here. 

I‚Äôm trying really hard to be supportive and do the best I can to help her succeed, but I‚Äôm not sure how to handle her when she reacts like this. 

Seeing her in this way deeply upset my partner and he is worried that we should have her move back with my parents. 

I don‚Äôt want to give up or make her feel.. any of the things that would make her feel. But I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Does anybody have suggestions of how I can best be there for my sister? Or how you felt supported by a friend or relative even when you felt like they were against you?

TLDR: My sister moved in with me and my partner. Want to find a way to help and support her so she doesn‚Äôt have to move back in with our parents",BPD,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/p9w31v/i_have_recently_become_the_guardian_of_my_sister/,Person w/o BPD,mutasly,p9w31v,/r/BPD/comments/p9w31v/i_have_recently_become_the_guardian_of_my_sister/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/p9w31v/i_have_recently_become_the_guardian_of_my_sister/,0,2021-08-23

**What is Bad Feng Shui for a House?**

You are likely wondering what bad Feng Shui really is and why it should be in your home. Feng shui is the combination of five elements and the environment that evokes good energy, luck. It also focuses on the spatial alignment of five elements. Feng shui promotes positive effects in all areas of your life.

Bad Feng Shui is any attempt to make an error in the environment or positions that are considered bad. Bad feng shui can have disastrous consequences. It can lead to a host of difficult situations in your life that can have negative effects on your health and wealth.

**How do you find the bad feng shui and not fall victim to it? Let‚Äôs know that.**

**Worst Feng Shui Mistakes to Avoid**

Feng shui can lead to an unbalanced and dangerous flow of energy. You should avoid common feng-shui errors, from cleanliness to how you treat feng-shui items. We have compiled a list of them in case you're curious.

**1. Incorrect Placement of Mirrors**

Mirror placement is a common feng shui error that should be avoided. The bad feng-shui clan will place the mirror directly in front of your bed. A feng-shui friendly act does not permit you to place a mirror directly in front of your entrance gate. A mirror at the entrance is believed to send good energy. It is important to be careful with how you treat mirrors throughout the house.

**How to Avoid It:**

* Do not place the mirror directly in front of your bed
* Do not place the mirror in front of the entrance to your home.

**2. Keeping Things You Don‚Äôt Like**

Another major feng shui error is to hold on to the reminiscent projection of gloomy captures. If it is only able to revive the winds of despair, it is not a good gesture. Feng Shui charm does not allow you to let things that cause heartbreaks, accidents, or other negative events in your home. It is vital to keep any negative resemblances from your home and your headspace closed to ensure that you live a happy, healthy life.

**How to Avoid It :**

* Give up on old possessions
* Get rid of anything that can pull you into a negative mentality
* Keep what you don't like.

**3. Seat Reserved by Clutter**

It is a big feng-shui error to give shelter to clutter in your home. Your home is where you can find laughter, a piece of cake, and a place to relax after a tiring day. Your home doesn't have to be in an unclean environment. Uncluttered spaces only encourage more clutter, which is contrary to feng shui principles. It blocks positive energy from entering your space and is associated with negative energy.

**How to Avoid It**

* Regularly sweep and mop your home
* De-clutter your home
* Toss everything and anything that doesn't serve any purpose

**4. Sad Little Plants**

You are making your plants unhappy by neglecting to take care of them properly, this is a serious feng shui error. You are expected to instill newness, vitality, and luck into your home by planting plants. If they don't get the best care, it is not fair. Are there any dead plants in your home? Did you neglect to water your plants for a while? If you answered yes, then you know where you're going wrong.

**How to Avoid It**

* Water plants  should be tended to regularly
* Let them enjoy enough sunshine
* You should not dust your plants with too many layers.

**5. House Full of Water Features**

Excessiveness does no good. There is a limit to everything. This idea goes with feng shui too. Although flowing water features are considered to be one the most luck-enhancing feng shui elements for money and luck, they shouldn't be too much. You can't have water features in your home if you don't allow them. This will cause the water features to lose their benefits. You can also check [2 bhk flat for rent in gardenia glory Noida](https://bivocalbirds.com/details/2-bhk-furnished-gardenia-glory-sector-46-nod-5eajr5)

**How to avoid it-**

* Use only one water feature in the house
* Make sure it has the water flowing

**Feng Shui Mistakes- Revolt, Don‚Äôt Reinvigorate**

Feng shui principles can help you find calm in your quest against stubborn mishaps and clingy bad luck. Sometimes, however, you can end up doing wrong or overdoing things for whatever reason and it becomes worse. A ritual check-in is a good idea. This allows you to see what bad Fengshui practices and items are worth. You can then politely dispose of them.

Knowing that my daughter is  being psychologically tortured in the woods, made me walk as quickly as possible towards the access road with the shotgun.

At this point, I cared zero about my own life, as I was more focused on rescuing the girls.

I thought it would be best, if I didn‚Äôt use the light on my iPhone and instead relied solely on the dim light of the moon.

I walk with the shotgun held in my right hand and rested on my right shoulder, almost the same way a marching soldier would walk with his or her rifle.

The weather feels like it‚Äôs 65 degrees Fahrenheit and fortunately there‚Äôs an almost full moon that is letting off an ample amount of moonlight.

After about a minute of walking, I see a disruption in the natural tree line of the Forrest, which must be the access road.

My body and mind ready‚Äôs itself for war.  I get all tensed up, as I try to play out the different scenarios in my mind that might unfold.

I start to walk through the access road, as the leaves on the trees cut off some of the moonlight and it gets darker. I walk a little bit slower to make less noise, as I don‚Äôt know how far back, I have to walk.

The Forrest is eerily quiet besides the sounds of bugs and other unknown creatures.

There‚Äôs an ample amount of ‚ÄúNo Trespassing‚Äù signs nailed to the trees about every ten yards apart.

I‚Äôve been walking for about five minutes, as I see the narrow access road open up to a larger field.  I start to smell the faint smell of smoke as I now know that I‚Äôm not far to where the girls are located.

As quietly as possible, I ready the shotgun. I try to imagine myself as a WW1 soldier, who just got the order to charge over the trenches. I tell myself that if I‚Äôm successful, my daughter and the two other girls life‚Äôs will be saved versus the WW1 soldiers who‚Äôs only potential victory would be about 20 yards of captured land.

I see an object that must be the bus about 30 yards away; however, I don‚Äôt see or hear any signs of the girls or Rosemary.  I start to crouch down to make myself less visible.

As I get to the back of the bus, I can make out a tent and I start to hear faint whimpering sounds, which I figure must be the girls.

In my still crouched down position, I move towards the whimpering sounds, as I‚Äôm constantly surveying around for Rosemary. I have no idea where she is or if she even knows that I‚Äôm here.  

As I slowly creep towards the whimpering sounds, I can tell that I‚Äôm getting closer and closer as the sounds are getting louder and louder.

Finally, I see that the girls are still tied to a tree.  I slowly walk towards them, as I don‚Äôt want to startle them, where they would yell and alert Rosemary, where I still don‚Äôt know where she is located.

The girls faces move in my direction as they hear me come towards them.

‚ÄúShh!‚Äù I say to hopefully keep them quiet.

‚ÄúDad!‚Äù Grace calls out.

Where I respond with another ‚ÄúShh!‚Äù

I look around in all directions and I still see no signs of Rosemary.

In the lowest possible voice, I say ‚ÄúHi girls, do you have any idea where that adult is, who tied you to this tree?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the tent!‚Äù Grace responds.

I put my shotgun down and I start to untie the girls.  My logic is that, if the girls are untied, then at least they can run away if Rosemary tries to ambush me somehow.

I really have to pull myself together and put these girls survival over my own, because I was the one who was foolish enough to allow my daughter to go on this trip, so I should be the one to suffer the consequences.

I untie Raquel first, then Amanda and lastly my daughter.  My daughter instinctively lunges towards me to give me a hug.

‚ÄúAre you girls positive that the person who tied you to the tree is in the tent?‚Äù I say in a whispered voice, where all three of the girls shake their heads in agreement.

Knowing what this woman has done to these girls, I slowly walk towards the tent with the shotgun.  The tent isn‚Äôt far from the tree that the girls were tied to.

When I‚Äôm about ten yards away from the tent, I release the safety from the shotgun and aim the gun at the tent. With this military grade automatic shotgun firmly pressed against my right shoulder, I creep a few more feet towards the tent and then I push the trigger.

‚ÄúBang!‚Äù The shotgun let‚Äôs off the loudest sound that must of woke up everything in the forest.

Followed by an ‚ÄúAww-ugg‚Äù which is a sound of relief, knowing that I must have struck Rosemary.

I fire two more shots into the tent which completely obliterates the tent.  

I take my iPhone out to use the flashlight and shine the light in one of the holes the shotgun created. 

I see blood splattered everywhere and Rosemary‚Äôs lifeless body.  Her head seems to be undamaged, so I take a step back and fire a shot into her head to ensure that she is truly dead.  Prior to tonight, bugs were the only things that I had ever intentionally killed and now I shattered a woman‚Äôs skull apart.

My body becomes less tense and relaxes, as I know the person who was psychologically torturing my daughter is now dead.  

With the shotgun in hand, I walk back towards the police cruiser with the three girls.  

Grace holds my cell phone‚Äôs flashlight, as I can see the three girls faces that look beyond traumatized.  At this point, I know that we‚Äôre still not out of the woods yet, so I don‚Äôt want to  give them a sense that we are all done with everything.

As we walk on the access road, no one says a word as I try to figure out what the next best course of action will be.

We get back to the main road where Dan and the police cruiser are located and I start to hear thumping noises.

‚ÄúStay here girls for a minute. I‚Äôll be right back!‚Äù

As I walk towards the police cruiser, I can see that Dan has almost kicked out the rear passenger side window, where the glass is partially hanging out.  I can tell that he only needs a few more kicks before the glass will either shatter or completely fall out, so knowing that he has a handgun, I rush towards the police cruiser.

I doubt that he sees me rushing towards the car, as he‚Äôs too focused on freeing himself.  

In a split second, I think to myself that once he‚Äôs out of the car, with his superior use of his 
handgun, he will have the upper hand, so I can‚Äôt chance it that he will probably just execute the four of us to leave no witnesses.

I‚Äôm about two arm lengths away from the damaged window and as he let‚Äôs off a big kick and shatters the window, where I quickly point the shotgun through the window and fire off four shots as quickly as possible.

My heart is racing a mile a minute and my body is completely tensed up.

After firing the fourth shot, I look through the opened window and see that I had mutilated Dan and his head is gushing out blood.

I probably didn‚Äôt need to shoot him four times but watching the videos of my young daughter being kidnapped and psychologically tortured, brought out the primordial animal inside of me, that just wanted to seek revenge on those who harmed my daughter.

I didn‚Äôt want to celebrate just yet, as we‚Äôre still stuck in the middle of nowhere. 

I place the shotgun on the hood of the car and I decide to drag Dan‚Äôs body out of the car. I figured it would be best to move his corpse to the tree line, so the girls wouldn‚Äôt be able to see his body.

After moving Dan‚Äôs corpse, I drop the shotgun by Dan‚Äôs body and wipe the blood off my hands in the grass.

Then I quickly jog towards the girls.

Grace is still holding my phone with the light on and the girls look so traumatized that there not even talking to each other.

I ask Grace for my phone and I see that I have no reception.

I really just want to get out of here as quickly as possible because I don‚Äôt know if Rosemary‚Äôs family members will come by or if there were other people involved in her plot.

Because of Dan, I have no trust in the police, so I don‚Äôt want to use the radio in the police cruiser.

I don‚Äôt want to subject the girls to sitting on the little yellow bus again so I decide to cram the three of them into the front passenger seat of the cruiser, then I get into the driver‚Äôs seat and drive. 

I‚Äôm hoping that I see signs for route 81 or the Turnpike‚Äôs Northeast‚Äôs extension.

After driving around for close to  20 minutes, I finally come to a fork in the road that points to route 81, which I know will lead us to the turnpike.

I don‚Äôt know what will happen to me for executing two people, but right now I‚Äôm just focused on getting these girls back home safely.

I look at the gas gauge and I figure we should have enough to get us back home.

I fly down the turnpike in the police car with the three girls cramped together in the front seat.

As I get closer to home, I call the two girls‚Äô mother‚Äôs to let them know the girls are safe and to meet us at the police station, where I originally met Dan.

Then I call the FBI and tell them what happened regarding the kidnapping of the three girls and myself, where I killed two people, one being a police officer.  I ask the FBI to meet me at the police station because I don‚Äôt trust the local police.

Anticipating that I will be put into custody, I call my mother to  take Grace home to her house.

About an hour later, I pull into the police station, where I see a mob of people to include news reporters and law enforcement officials.  

As I stop the car, I think to myself, as long as Grace and the other girls are safe, I really don‚Äôt care what happens to me at this point.",Wholesomescarystories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wholesomescarystories/comments/p9tsqd/some_psychopath_is_trying_to_become_tiktok_famous/,,mtp6921,p9tsqd,/r/Wholesomescarystories/comments/p9tsqd/some_psychopath_is_trying_to_become_tiktok_famous/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wholesomescarystories/comments/p9tsqd/some_psychopath_is_trying_to_become_tiktok_famous/,0,2021-08-23

GM4F Exhibitionism Themed Prompts,"(Please read the entire post before messaging)

*1) First Time Nudist:* Here, you'll just be an ordinary person who decided to go to a nudist colony for the first time. Maybe you'd gone naked at home before, but you haven't done it around people before. Maybe you've never done anything like this and heard about it from an article online or from a friend.

*2) Stranded:* For this one, I was thinking you and a couple friends decided to go to a nudist beach for the first time. However, as a prank, your friends decide to leave you and take *everything* you had with you. Phone, wallet, keys...and clothes. How will you get back to safety? Will you ask one of the other beach goers for help? Will you make the trek on foot?

*3) A Midnight Run:* For this one, you'd be a woman who was curious about exhibitionism, but are just now getting the nerve to try it for yourself. You'd found a park that was pretty deserted at night. You'd scouted it for a few days in advance and found it suitable for what you want to do. The night comes, you strip down, and walk around for a few minutes, only to hear someone walk up behind you and keep you from getting back to your clothes. In this one, I'd be ok with some light teasing, but nothing forced/non-con.

*4) A Whole Nude World:* For this one, you'd wake up one day to find that clothes no longer exist, and seemingly never existed. No one you talk to remembers them. Pictures on your phone and online have everyone in them completely nude. For this, I'm hoping the start is you getting past the shock of such a drastic change, but then it'd morph into a slice-of-life thing. You going about your life, learning how everything is different. If you'd like, you can be someone who was already a bit of an exhibitionist and has very little trouble adjusting. Or maybe you're more reserved and need the support of a trusted friend. Or somewhere in the middle. I'm happy with anything.

*5) Nudist Neighbor:* Here, you'd have a next door neighbor who you've had a crush on ever since he/she moved in a few weeks ago. However, just as you're getting the nerve to ask them out, you see them in their backyard completely naked. And once you start looking, it's an almost daily occurrence. Skinny dipping, sunbathing, yard work, all of it naked. How do you handle this? Do you tell them you saw them? Do you lie and say you're a nudist yourself? Are you actually a nudist yourself?

*6) Nudity Is Now Legal:* In a rather controversial move, Congress has passed a law allowing US citizens to register as full-time nudists. These people can not be discriminated against because of their choice. You could play as someone who has just registered, or maybe is having to adjust to seeing nude people regularly 

*7) Your Ideas:* Maybe you're not interested in any of the ideas here, but reading them got the creative juices flowing? That's great! I'd love to hear your ideas. Or maybe you just have a small suggestion to make one of these more enjoyable for you. That's great too! Bring on the fresh ideas!

Here's a link to my [kink list](https://i.imgur.com/bQoE0yr.png)

I shouldn't have to say this, but please read my kink list before messaging me. And if there's something on there that's labeled ""no"", that doesn't mean ""convince me"".

I prefer shorter responses. 1-3 paragraphs. I feel this allows for faster responses and more freedom for the partner to choose what they respond with. However, that isn't set in stone. I'm willing to go up to 5 paragraphs per response.

In your first message, please include:

* Which prompt(s) you're interested in
* What your preferences are in terms of partners (age, race, gender, body type, etc)
* What your character will look like (Either a physical description or a picture will work. I will provide the same for any character you interact with in a significant way. Bonus points to anyone open to playing a celeb/celeb look-alike. Not necessary, though)
* What kinks you'd like to include and what you'd like to avoid
* Your favorite color, so I know you read this far

Also, I don't know why, but people seem to ghost me within a day of messaging me. I don't know if it's me or them. If I say something you don't like, please tell me! I want to build something that both of us can enjoy.",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9p0k4/gm4f_exhibitionism_themed_prompts/,RP,anxietycatalyst,p9p0k4,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9p0k4/gm4f_exhibitionism_themed_prompts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9p0k4/gm4f_exhibitionism_themed_prompts/,0,2021-08-23

[21][A4A][Telegram: secret_base | Kik: the_secret_base] Hypnosis prompts inside! (Also open to your ideas!),"Good evening everybody! NOTE: All participants and characters MUST absolutely be 18+!  

I can play either the hypnotist or the hypnotized victim(s) in any of these roleplays!! Just let me know which role(s) you would like us to play!

There is a password hidden below in this post so make sure to read everything! Also even if you are a top and want to be the hypnotist, send the password anyway! (This will make more sense when you find the password! (; )

I have a number of ideas for some hypnosis RPs! One of us would play one character who would go around and hypnotize people, while the other person would play the people getting hypnotized. I have a number of ideas for this kind of RP in terms of plot, but I am open to any sort of ideas that you may have for this plot or even just any sort of RP ideas! These are just my ideas. Keep in mind I am bisexual, I'm open to MxM, FxM, and FxF! I will say I‚Äôm not super open to playing futanaris, sorry! Even if an RP sounds like it is going to be straight, gay, etc., we can change it to your liking!

1a. This is based off of [this image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/542076680227913749/869824169150406716/unknown.png). You just lost another Pok√©mon battle and you had no sort of currency to give to the other trainer. You try to think of a way to give them an IOU, but you soon find yourself bending over and waiting for the other trainer to fill you up. Surely this is normal, right?  
  
1b. Additionally, this can also be based off [this image.](https://static1.e621.net/data/3a/70/3a7034dea1264e424a7de10a0d2c7e4e.jpg) In this rp, you can lose a Pokemon battle to a wild Pokemon, or even one of your Pokemon gets upset with you. Either way, they‚Äôre going to be taking their pent out frustration on you~!  
  
2. This is based off of [this image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384075429289525258/637527502532902933/image0.jpg). It is an idea that one of us is the owner of a soon-to-be restaurant. It believes in really pushing the limits at which the laws apply to public nudity. The CEO needs a restaurant to own, employees, to persuade the health inspector, chefs, etc.! We can also use this RP to do other sort of companies like porn studios, companies, etc.!  
  
3. There is a new law in place that replaces abstinence-only classes with sex-only classes. These students are too close-minded though! The teacher needs to ""convince"" these students to be more passionate/participatory in the class however!  
  
4. A group of friends order a hypnotist for their party! They can either be a normal one who takes advantage of them after the party or a special NSFW hypnotist!  
  
5. Do you need to train your bitch of a spouse? Does your son or daughter need to know who the real alpha of the house is? Call 1-800-TRI-GGER!  
  
6. Your local Renaissance Faire has a cute little tent dedicated to the art of hypnosis! You roll your eyes at the sight of it to find yourself walking in to see just what this was about.  
  
7. A massage this time of year sounds amazing! It‚Äôs nice to get some much needed rest and relaxation. I should tell the masseuse how much I‚Äôm loving this massage, but I don‚Äôt want to interrupt him as he fucks my mouth.  
  
8. The latest product in hypnosis technology is being shown off at a very secret lecture. What better way to show off its exciting features than to let someone in the audience use it! Nothing could go wrong, right?  
  
9. Your friend group had always seen you and another member of the friend group as a potentially super cute couple, but you two never gave it any thought. So, they take matters into their own hands during tonight‚Äôs movie night. You two were gonna be forced to like each other.  
  
10. You and your space crew fly through the galaxy, unknown of the parasite that you had picked up. Whether it be a slug that crawls into your ear or a full on xenomorph, you and your crew will learn what it means to mess with aliens. (This could also be Among Us themed).  
  
11. The newest season of Big Brother is here! The catch this season is that fans at home get to vote on ways to toy with and tease the contestants via a voting hypnotism app!  
  
12. Obedience school is a perfect place for your pet to get trained and turned loyal to their Master! Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to see a demonstration of how pets get trained, only this time you‚Äôre the pet?  
  
13. Your current doctor is out of town so for your checkup, you‚Äôre assigned to this new doctor. Some of their new methods are a little weird, but what do you care? The doctor is always right!    
  
14. You don‚Äôt need a babysitter! You‚Äôre way too old for that kind of stuff, but I guess mom and dad don‚Äôt trust you. That‚Äôs okay, because your babysitter is going to take care of you in ways you haven‚Äôt been taken care of since... well... a baby!  
  
15. Whatever ideas you might have! I‚Äôm open to your own hypnosis ideas as well as any other ideas/prompts that don‚Äôt coorelate with this post! I‚Äôm very open to a lot of kinks!  

If you want to play the multiple characters and you feel you don't have enough refs (or you don't have a ref in general), don't fret! I have a large collection of refs for you to pick from includings males, females, femboys, and futas (not many futas though). I'm sure you'll be able to find a ref (most likely several) that you like!

Please be literate and don‚Äôt type one-liners. You don't need to write pages upon pages of work (although that would be awesome), but as long as you write enough for me to work with, then that would be fine! Poor grammar is a big turn off for me so please (when we RP) do not type all lowercase, use abbreviations, etc.! Please do not respond to this ad if you do not think you‚Äôre going to do this!

I‚Äôm into a lot of stuff, but my few limits are hyper and feet. Please do not come to me with an RP idea if they involve one of these two kinks or (THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!) refs that are HYPER or even refs that you might believe are a liiittle too thicc! (Password: Please breed me Master/Mistress. [Whichever you prefer]) Also, I have a bit of trouble playing futanaris and cboys, just not my thing sorry!  

Please start your first message with your name, age, prompt(s) you like/your own prompt(s), and the password! Refs are also encouraged in your first message, but if you don‚Äôt have one on hand, that‚Äôs fine! I have plenty!  

Add me on Telegram (@secret_base) or Kik (the_secret_base) and send me what RP idea(s) you like and/or your own ideas! I also have a Discord, so just let me know if you‚Äôd prefer that! Can't wait to talk to all of you! If I do not respond, I will get back to you ASAP! I am in EST (but I‚Äôm a major night owl) so I might be away, but don't fret!

I'm in my mid 20s and totally lost,"So I guess this is gonna be a legit ""off my chest"" rant, not sure how coherent I'll be, I'm sleep deprived and just need to vent a bit.

I have a good life, haven't been formally diagnosed but my entire family work in the mental health field and basically everyone figured out I was high functioning autistic when I was like 4 and nobody thought to tell me or make me leave my comfort zone. Which led to me basically having zero social skills. I'm 24, been on a few dates, never had a relationship, never even had my first kiss yet. My only real friend is a guy I met in 5th grade who is functions at a lower level than me, weve been friends for like 15 years, hes my best friend, so I love him like a brother, but it would be nice to be able to maintain more than one friendship, only reason ours even survived is because we're the type of friends who can have no contact for years and then just pick up like we never stopped. Didn't even hear about possibly being on the spectrum until a couple years ago, in my early 20s. Because of this my mom has basically resigned herself to taking care of me for her whole life. And to her credit, she's done pretty well, we differ politically and we fight periodically, but I have a home, I have air conditioning in this hell of a texas summer, I have game consoles and food, she even pays me 50 bucks a week to keep the house running. Compared to so many people on this planet, it's a good life, but I've realized that in settling into it I've basically sabotaged my future in a lot of ways. I dropped out of high school in 10th grade, waited like 3 years to get a G.E.D., then waited ANOTHER 3 years before starting college. I'm on my 4th semester and still not sure what I want to do, I feel like a ""normal"" job would crush me. I've had them in the past, I always want to die when I do, until I started college I jumped from job to job, Pawnshop, Gas Station, Dollar Store, Gamestop, Kitchen, Hell even a call center. All those within the frame of maybe 3-4 years, with at least one 8 month break in there. Longest job I had was Dollar store and it was just under a year, shortest was the call center that lasted maybe a week. Family has always been supportive, despite our problems, they're always ecstatic when I get a new one, and, while disappointed, understanding when I leave. I haven't had one since about 6 months before the pandemic started, which, all things considered, may be the one time I quit that long term was a decent call, despite not knowing that at the time. I seem to be incapable of learning math, I failed it on the college exam, failed it on the GED by 2 points (but somehow they passed me), failed remedial math twice in college (well, not quite fail, because I saw that my grade was way beyond saving both times and dropped before it could count against me). Only thing I got going for me is that my GPA is a 3.5 because I excel at basically every other subject. The only thing I feel that would bring me any degree of happiness or success is to work in the entertainment industry, because I like to write, and I'm actually pretty decent at it, good even, but that's like winning the lottery and it feels like every time I build some steam and get stuff done, depression hits and grinds it to a halt. I have an entire universe of heroes ready to go, 30-40 named original main characters with backstories and everything, even wrote an outline for the first series series in the universe, hell I even have a pilot script basically done, but it never went anywhere. Then I have probably half a dozen other ideas saved on a Google drive that arent connected to that universe in any way, at least not yet. I got so close, but it's still so unobtainable, or at least that's how it feels.. My classes start tomorrow, only taking 2 this time because it's about time to start committing to something and I have no idea what. But one of them is Composition II, so at least that should help with writing, not like that will realistically amount to anything, but still. I'm doing ok now, but it's just overwhelming. And I know what's on my plate isn't even a taste of what people in the ""real world"" deal with. Which scares me even more. and that fear leads to more inaction, which leads to even further sabotage. It's a self fulfilling cycle and I don't know how to break it.",offmychest,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/p9oejp/im_in_my_mid_20s_and_totally_lost/,,supbitch,p9oejp,/r/offmychest/comments/p9oejp/im_in_my_mid_20s_and_totally_lost/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/p9oejp/im_in_my_mid_20s_and_totally_lost/,0,2021-08-23

20 week pup shy of strangers,"My boyfriend and I adopted a 20 week coon hound mix (male) a little bit ago from a local rescue. So far, he‚Äôs been doing really well with potty training and sleeps through the night in his crate with no issue. He‚Äôs a smart little guy and is great around both of us. 

We also have a friend staying with us who he is very apprehensive of. He will gingerly sniff an outstretched hand or take treats but duck away from pets. The nervousness doesn‚Äôt go away if approached, but pup is perfectly happy to fall asleep at our feet with him sitting in another chair a few feet away.  He isn‚Äôt interested in toys either when he is around, but will approach when being ignored by friend and do some timid sniffs.  

Additionally, pup is not into taking walks. He will sit down or pull backwards, and treats only lure him so far. If we carry him away from home he is more than happy to walk back home, pulling as well, clearly nervous. 

If approached by a stranger he will gingery sniff a hand, but again no pets, he ducks out of the way. If another dog is around, he will also sniff and warm up fairly quickly. He tried to hump a dog t second time he met her(he is altered) and she was not happy and let him know. He took the hint and was fine with another dog we were with. We were there with my boyfriends parents who he met that day and after some time he would accept pets but not in the stereotypical puppy runs up tail wagging way, still timid.  

We also took him to a local dog park to see how he would do off leash. Nervous at first but before you know it he was running around and playing happy as can be. Began humping an older dog but stopped when the dog set his boundaries. After this, during play at home he will occasionally try to mount us. We interrupt him immediately and ignore for a minute before continuing play, it seems to be helping. 

Does this sound normal for a 5 month old? We know he was with his litter mates at the shelter and would play with them, but I‚Äôm concerned his timidness will turn to aggression or not resolve at all.  What can we do help him? Tips to get him to love walks and be more accepting of people?",puppy101,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/p9osqg/20_week_pup_shy_of_strangers/,Socialization,whingingwillow,p9osqg,/r/puppy101/comments/p9osqg/20_week_pup_shy_of_strangers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/p9osqg/20_week_pup_shy_of_strangers/,0,2021-08-23

I see him tomorrow.,"TLDR: unhealthy 10 yr relationship ended, have to see the ex in person (he's my ride) tomorrow after about a month+ being apart, afraid things will get sexual and I give in.

It's been maybe about 15 days since I last saw him in person, but we had broken up about 4 weeks before then and things did not end well at all. 

I had to go to his place to pick up my left ear bud. When I saw him, I asked him if he missed me, and he replied ""not really"" (not in a mean way or anything). Still, it stung. I drove home trying not to cry and trying to accept that this was the end, but was unsuccessful. That same night I ended up texting him a barrage of msgs, from being sweet and loving and nostalgic to being angry and bitter and back to sweet. I was hoping for a response, any kind of response. We were together for around 10 years but always on and off, because I think we were/are emotionally immature; I'm 38 and he's 39. It was always an unhealthy relationship from the beginning because of how we handled the difficulties and differences between us. So many break-ups but then getting back together because we couldn't stay away from each other. Cliche but it felt real, more real than anything before him. He was toxic in the beginning of our relationship while I tried to be patient, and it was vice versa at the end of our relationship. 

The last time I texted him anything was on Aug 11, recognizing what he said about me being toxic...which was true. All my insecurities and jealousy and whatever I brought into our space he no longer wanted to be a part of it. I didn't blame him, and I thanked him for not giving in; for standing his ground. And that was it. He never responded, which was fine, and I stopped texting him. 

He reached out 5 days ago to ask about the ride he was going to give me, which I thought he'd forgotten about. I have an embolization procedure tomorrow and they won't allow me to drive (which I have done like 7 or 8 times prior. So I asked him at some point, after we had broken up. I had no one else really to ask - friends live in a nearby town about 45 mins away and my brother would be busy working and with his family. He lives about 15-20 mins away from me. Oh and the hospital doesn't allow Uber-ing from there after being anesthetized. 

So anyway. I told him he didn't have to pick me up but he insisted, and I really did need a ride. He texted asking me if I'll need to be looked after for the next few hours once leaving the hospital, suggesting we stop at my apt to feed my cats, and then we go back to his and he could take care of me while I rested up. I told him no, that by the time I leave the hospital I should be fine on my own. 

We had an emotional, passionate sex/love life. I think why we were drawn back to each other so often, without working out the stressors. I don't want to assume this...but I think he was trying to get me back to his place so we could maybe have sex. I couldn't help but think that, however, due to our history.

Mannnn I have been so horny this whole month and it's been sucking. He makes me so weak in the knees and knows exactly how to melt me. That's the only thing I am afraid of that may happen tomorrow. Once he touches me, caresses my skin, and we kiss...I'll just give in.

They Know I'm Here Now,"It all started when my uncle first told me that he'd seen a sasquatch. I didn't believe him but something about the way he told the story just captured my imagination. I thought maybe he'd been mistaken in what he'd seen. I know now that I shouldn't have doubted him.

There is a vast forest just beyond my backyard that stretches all the way back to a cliff face. Within those woods you can find abandoned mines, streams and even old run down wooden cabins. This was the playground of my early youth and the inspiration for many camping ventures.

One fall night, my uncle Peter came over to visit. He, my dad and I spent the night beneath the stars around a campfire in the backyard. My dad had cut some old pine wood and stacked the logs perfectly in a circle. The fire rose up to illuminate the backyard and a monochrome cloud pierced the star studded night sky.

‚ÄúYa know what they use pine wood for, right boy?‚Äù said Uncle Peter sitting down at the campfire.

I shook my head.

‚ÄúCoffins. A pine wood box. Six feet down,‚Äù he said with a snarky grin. He laughed as he threw another log into the fire.

Uncle Peter was an odd fellow but trustworthy and reliable. He‚Äôd come to my rescue many times, driving out to fix my vehicle in the freezing snow when it broke down on the side of the road and always offering his country wisdom.

A peculiar sound cut through the night. It sounded like a woman screaming. ‚ÄúWhat the heck was that?‚Äù I said in a panic, scanning the darkness.

‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs just an old screech owl. Nothing to worry about. I‚Äôve seen things and heard things out in the woods that would really scare ya. Beatles the size of your fist and wandering hungry coyotes that certainly weren‚Äôt afraid of humans,‚Äù said Uncle Peter.

For some reason this didn‚Äôt calm my nerves. My uncle then looked at me with a dead serious expression on his face and said ‚ÄúYa wanna know about the weirdest thing I‚Äôve ever run into out there?‚Äù

My dad and I knew that he was about to tell us anyway, so we both agreed.

‚ÄúWell, it was out in that national forest just north of here. I was out after dark collecting firewood and I started hearing these odd knocking sounds as if someone was hitting a stick up against a tree trunk. Then I heard an extremely loud noise that made the hair on the back on my neck stand up. I froze in place. It was an animal I had never heard before.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe sound was a deep whooping call like that of a very large ape. The next thing I knew I saw two sets of orange glowing eyes in the dark. I shined my flashlight on it, only to see an eight foot tall upright standing creature, like a man but covered in thick dark brown hair. It let out another one of those whooping cries and I booked it out of there immediately. I never ran so fast in my life. Never seen anything like it and I hope I never do again.‚Äù

My dad and I were completely silent as Uncle Peter told his story. Afterwards we were visibly tense and we didn‚Äôt spend much longer at the campfire before heading back inside. My uncle only laughed at our fear.

‚ÄúSee, not so worried about that screech owl now, huh?‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt entirely convinced by my uncle‚Äôs story. I wondered if he just made it up to scare us. I mean that‚Äôs what a ‚Äúcampfire story‚Äù is right? I thought maybe he‚Äôd just seen an odd bear obscured in the dark and mistaken it for something more.

Surely even avid outdoorsmen can be mistaken, I thought. It seemed more likely than the idea that there were ape creatures somehow living out there in the forests. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I had to know for myself.

So, in the weeks that followed my uncle's visit, I got the bright idea to head out into the nearby national forest where he supposedly saw the creature. What a mistake that was. I set out on my adventure in my dad‚Äôs old mud-covered pickup truck, with only a camera hanging from my neck to document whatever I saw.

A canopy of trees stood above me in colorful autumn variety. A bizarre feeling walked alongside me as I wandered along the path. It was evening time and my surroundings were beginning to turn a blue tint. I walked through the forest with great uneasiness. A thousand eyes were watching me. The fall wind drifted through the environment and across the leaf quilted forest floor.

Suddenly, a knocking sound. It was hollow, an unmistakable tap on the side of a far off tree trunk. I took a step forward. Again, a distinct knock, wooden in tone. What followed was a loud guttural whooping sound which sent shivers down my spine. It was just as my uncle described and like he did, I ran right out of there. I bolted for the truck without even thinking to lift my camera.

Though I didn‚Äôt see what made the sounds, I knew at this point that there was something out there. Something not quite human but not quite animal. I couldn‚Äôt prove it but at least I knew the truth for myself.

All the way home, as I drove, I had the unsettling feeling of being watched. My eyes gazed worriedly at the trees on either side of the road. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling until I pulled into my driveway. I went to bed that night without even bothering to share with my dad what I‚Äôd heard. I didn‚Äôt feel like telling anyone about my experience.

Hours later, I awoke to a sound in the backyard. I grabbed my flashlight and walked out onto the back porch. To my utter horror, I saw a pair of bright glowing orange eyes at the edge of the woods.

I hovered my flashlight over the glowing eyes to reveal a large hairy creature, standing eerily still between the trees and looking right at me with an almost human expression. The ape creature looked just as bewildered as I did at seeing him. He studied me curiously from across the backyard as if amazed by my existence. Four other sets of colorful eyes in green, red and yellow then suddenly blinked to life in the darkness. He was not alone.

The group of sasquatch simply stared at me for a moment before unleashing an ungodly sound. I quickly went inside and bolted the door shut. The eyes eventually faded, disappearing into the woods behind my house. I didn‚Äôt get any sleep that night, I just sat up in bed staring out the window and waiting for their return.

Yesterday, I found a set of massive footprints in my backyard. It was bigger than any person could make, large barefoot impressions pressed deeply into the mud. There's no question in my mind, no debate and no ambiguity. There are bizarre ape-like creatures living in the woods. My uncle and I have seen them, and countless others have as well.

I‚Äôm not saying I believe all the stories of sasquatch, but there are those who have actually witnessed these creatures. Those folks know what I‚Äôm talking about. Keep in mind, if you haven‚Äôt seen them, you just might one day. These are not just scary stories, these are not just campfire tales. They are out there, I‚Äôve seen them, but worse yet - they‚Äôve seen me.

They‚Äôve followed me through the forest, shadowed me from behind the trees and have come back with me to my home to live. I know now what it‚Äôs like to be an undiscovered animal spotted for the first time. I know what it‚Äôs like to be studied from a distance. There‚Äôs nothing I can do. They know where I am. I can't hide. They know I'm here now.",scarystories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/p9v66s/they_know_im_here_now/,,Levi_Athens,p9v66s,/r/scarystories/comments/p9v66s/they_know_im_here_now/,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/p9v66s/they_know_im_here_now/,0,2021-08-23

So, we're here. This is, the place that I live in. I know it's not too big, but I see that as a bonus honestly. [chuckles] It's much easier to keep the place clean atleast.


Well, I feel like when it's a big place you live in, it kinda makes you feel more lonely because of all the empty spaces it can have.¬† Atleast with small houses, you feel less lonely when everything is more closer together. It's like a worm embrace almost. Atleast, that's how I see it.


Oh, yeah sure! You can obviously come in.I'm sorry for keeping you at the door like this. Hehe...


Y-yeah, you can put your shoes in the cabinet right there and I'll bring a fresh pair of sandals for you. No no, you're gonna love it, I promise. It's super comfy and super soft on your feet. Let me just bring it for you right now.


And~ there! Try it out.


I know right! They're so good. I have such a hard time getting onto my outdoor shoes every day. It's like, how do you even stop wearing these worm fluffy sandals and wear the rough, not so comfy shoes. [Chuckle]


Ah! Why are we still standing at my doorway let's go, I'll show you around the house now.


[Some time passes]


So, how'd you like it.


[Smiles] I'm glad you liked it.


Oh, you want to know why I didn't show you my bedroom. Hmm. Let's just say..... [whispers] I have someone special planned for you in there.


[Laughs] Well, for one, it's a secret. So no telling before I actually show you the secret. And secondly, I did *kinda* expected you to come by my house tonight. Atleast that's what I hoped for. Now that I think about it, if by any chance you didn't want to come by, it would be pretty sad to come back alone to the arrangements I've made. Oh! Speaking of arrangements, how about we get out of our fancy clothes and slip into something more comfortable?


Oh, don't worry, your boyfriend overhere have already made arrangements for your clothes.


Yep, all you gotta do, is go to your right, and you'll find the shower. I already had the bath running for a while now so I *think* it should be filled by now, and. And when you're done I'll have your new comfy clothes and towel ready for your in the hanger outside. Sounds good?


Okay, then you take a relaxing bath, and I'll start working on the other arrangements that I have.


¬†Oh yeah~ there's a *lot* of exciting stuff coming. I even have a whole list right here [grins]. So.. See you soon then~ [smiles]


[Some time passes]


Ah! You scared me there [laughs]


What? These sandals make almost no sound. And I didn't know you'd sneak up on me like! [Giggles]


I see the clothes seem to fit you decently well. I didn't really want to ask you your size Incase it ruined the surprise, so I just went with a slightly bigger size than what I thought would fit you. You know, just incase.¬†


[Chuckles] I'm glad you like the fact that it's a bit oversized. I actually think it looks very cute on you. Your little hands not being able to reach out all the way. [Giggles]


Well anyways, Since we're all freshened up, how about we finally find out what's in my bedroom~ HEHEHE!


Hmm? Oh, I actually have another small bathroom for guests, so I just used that one in the meantime.


Well, you're not just any guest, you're special. I wouldn't want you to shower in that cramped bathroom would I?


Shush, you're ruining my big reveal [giggles]


Okay, I need you to close your eyes for me. And don't open before I tell you to!


Okay, I'll count until 3, and then you can open your eyes.

And~


[Door opens]


[Inhales]


[Exhales]


So, What'd you think? The smell of the rain, with fluffy cuddly plushies, the TV playing raindrop videos and of course, lots of chocolates.


H-hey, are you okay? Y-you don't seem very happy. In fact you're.... You're crying? H-hey, did I go too overboard with all the arrangements and stuff. I could drop you off if yo-


S-so you like it?


[Sighs] oh, that's such a relief! I was so scared that I did something wrong and,- forget about it. Why are crying?


[Smiles] you.. were crying because you we're very happy? Oh, I, guess it's not the most craziest thing to cry when someone gets overwhelmed. A-anywas. How about we actually step inside, because, not to be stingy, but I did kinda put a lot of effort into making all these arrangements and making sure the smell doesn't go out and ruin the surprise, so if we could finally get in it would be fantastic. [Chuckles]


Here, I'll grab the towel, and you sit right in the middle of the bed, meanwhile I'll get comb to brush your hair, and then when it dries out ,I'll braid them.


Huh? Why? You think I can't braid hair~? Hmmm~?


[Giggles] it's okay, I know that's not what you meant. I know, men aren't usually expected to know things like these, but, I always had an interest in stuff like these. Plus I braid my little cousin's and nephews hair all the time whenever I get to see them. I guess you could say, it's somewhat of a hobby of mine [chuckles]


[Gets into bed]


So, just sit right here, yeah, that seems good enough, and I'll have this pillow under my but because otherwise it's gonna be a bit hard for me to properly reach your hair [chuckles]


Hey, you're the one who decided to date me, so you're just gonna have to deal with me not being so tall compared to you. [Chuckles]


Oh! I almost forgot!


[Rain sounds play from now on]


Of course we're gonna *have* to have raindrop sounds with the rain¬† drop fragment.


Okay, let's start with the hair brushing now


[Hair brushing starts]


[Some breathing and smiling sounds after a few minutes while hair brushing]


*Talk in long pauses between words and sentences and in a low voice from now on*


[After a few minutes]


I love how well kept your hair is by the way. [Smiles] The way the comb just goes all the way down your hair without getting stuck, how it feels so soft on my hands, and how it always smells so good as well.


[Chuckles] You want me to tell you what your hair smells like? Hmm, I assume it smells like the only shampoo I had in the bathroom for you¬† [giggles].


How did I know it's the shampoo you always use? Well, I might've been a huge fan of how your hair smells, and I might've went to the mall smelling shampoos like an old pervert. [laughs]


Well, I'm pretty sure the girl that was showing me around the shampoo stalls thinks I'm a pervert by the way she was looking at me, but~, atleast I could buy you the exact shampoo that you are used to. Well, atleast I hoped it was. Because smelling so many shampoos can get pretty tiresome for your nose. Especially the ones that are made for girls. So many different smells to choose from, And so intense as well. I think I'm gonna be sick if I smelled any more of them.


No, I'm not sick of the smell from *your* hair. because your hair smells much different than the actual shampoo. It's like, as if it's a a similar smell to the shampoo, but also completely different smell when you use it. Like, your own unique smell. That's also why I had to smell so many of them. I knew how it smelled like, but because your hair smells a bit different than the actual shampoo, I couldn't quite match it the first time. So I wasn't 100 percent sure if it was the right one until I smelled your hair again.[ Chuckles]


[Small pause]


So, what do you think about my hair brushing skills? Are feeling relaxed? [Chuckles]


Hmm, that's good then. As long as you feel all relaxed, and comfy and free of all stress, that's all that matters to me. I know you've been a bit, worried lately. About our relationship. I know we've agreed on taking it slow, but I understand if me inviting you to stay the night can be a bit overwhelming for you. Not to, generalise, but usually when a guy *or* a girl, asks their date to stay the night, it's usually for, you know, to have sex. But I really just wanted you to come over so we can get to know eachother a bit more.. intimately. So we could be more comfortable with eachother, learn smell little about how we are like when we're going to overpriced restaurants with fancy clothes [Chuckles]. I want you to know how I'm like in the comfort of my home, and in the comfort of my soft t-shirt and pajamas, and.. I want to know the same things about you. I believe that falling in love is not just about, meating eyes for the first time and instantly being head over heels. It's also about all the little stuff. To know what things they like, to know what small things you can do to make them happy, to know little secrets about one another [smiles] that's the kind of love I want to have with you.... You get what I'm saying right?


[Brushing stops]


[Smiles] [whispers] so you're already asleep. So this is how you look when you're fast asleep. [Smiles] so calm, so relaxed and so adorable~!. Well, I guess I'll braid your hair and leave you to sleep for an hour or so. And then when you wake up, we're gonna have some delicious food for your hungry little tummy, and then, maybe we'll do some other fun stuff.


[Smiles] [kisses forehead]

"I Don't Know If I Should Be Enraged, In Pure Shock, Or Be Relieved That My Mother Sold Our Horses Without Talking to Me First.","Like the title says, I don't know what to feel other than numbness for what my mother has done! (TL;DR at bottom) 

For context: back when I was in middle school (I'm now 23 and married), my mother and I started working/volunteering at a horse rescue. We made many friends - both horse and human - and eventually we adopted a paint mare (female horse) and a miniature donkey gelding (fixed male) together. Out of all the horses we went through over the years following, our paint mare and mini donkey were *always* the ones to be there for us. As the years went on, those two became more and more of a ""lawn ornament"" - meaning a horse you don't ride anymore and they just hang out in the pasture looking pretty - due to my mother not being able to ride anymore. *I* was always the one to ride our mare, not my husband, not my step dad, *me*.  Of course I slowed down on riding her once she hit her 20s, but I still sat on her and kept her used to that form of contact, because sometimes that was my comfort zone and she was a stress reliver. 

Now let me clarify some things: Our paint mare is not a horse for a beginner rider. When she came to the rescue all those years ago, she was a spoiled horse who always got her way thanks to her previous owner's kids riding her in a round pen for as long as they had her. This created a ""lazy horse"", so when any person older than 5 took her out on a trail ride, she would throw fits and buck and kick and ""crow hop"" (bounce up and down in place) because she didn't want to work, all she wanted to do was walk in a circle. Fast forward to now: she hasn't been ridden/worked in at least 3 years, so she's reverted back into her ""lazy"" phase. As for the mini donkey, he was never properly trained in anything (even when he came to the rescue) so he was always a comfort buddy for our paint mare.

With that being said: my mother sold them to the family that delivered hay to them so that way their middle child could have a horse to ride in 4H events.. Let me repeat that: **my mother sold a grumpy 25 year old horse and a borderline wild mini donkey to a family for their kids to work with.** 

*THIS IS WHY I WANTED HER TO TALK TO ME FIRST.* 

I'm the one who knows more about horse husbandry than her thanks to me studying for many years to become a horse vet. These two animals have been in my life just as long as hers. And out of no where and with no warning WHATSOEVER, my mother text me tonight saying ""so these two will be leaving tomorrow morning for their new homes, I'm so upset and I can't stop crying""........ I'm sorry, *YOU'RE* so upset!? *You* live upstate 3 hours away from me, *you* got to look out your kitchen window literally every day and see them, *you* got to fill their water trough, *you* got to go out and brush them and give them treats and hug them, all for the past 6 years now!!! The last time *I* saw them was May of this year, and that was only for 3 days. *3 DAYS*. Yes while my mom has every right to be upset because two of our family members are leaving forever, I have a right to be much more upset than she ever will be. Wanna know why? ***I DON'T GET TO SAY GOODBYE.*** Yeah. I am once again being robbed of my ability to say goodbye to the horses I love. The ""first"" time was with my heart horse, who was MY horse. She was 32, so one day back in either 2018 or 19, she laid down for a nap and just couldn't get up. My mom and step dad had to call the vet to put her down, and I couldn't say goodbye because I was 3 hours away and wouldn't have made it in time to see her. And now our two other horses (I call our mini donkey a horse to make him feel tall) are going to be sold to a family even farther away from me and I had absolutely no warning whatsoever. 

Despite all of this: A) this isn't the first time I've had them ripped away from me. When I moved out from my abusive step dad's house in 2015, without any warning my mom and him packed up the horses and moved to where they are now, all while I was at school (like they had a friend haul the horses off to the new house while I was at school), so I didn't get to say goodbye then either. And B) I'm somewhat relieved that they will no longer be stuck in a super small paddock that was so poorly maintained that I even hated taking pics of the horses. I'm glad they will be going to a better home. 

I just don't know what exactly to feel, and it's tearing me up. 

***TL;DR:::***  My mother sold our original 2 horses - who I loved *very* much and who were mine just as much as hers - to her friends without *ever* informing me ahead of time, and now they're leaving first thing in the morning and I won't get to say goodbye or get to see them ever again. I am all at once heartbroken, enraged, and relieved because to me it feel like they just passed away.",offmychest,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/p9vaew/i_dont_know_if_i_should_be_enraged_in_pure_shock/,,ThePaganRavenGoddess,p9vaew,/r/offmychest/comments/p9vaew/i_dont_know_if_i_should_be_enraged_in_pure_shock/,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/p9vaew/i_dont_know_if_i_should_be_enraged_in_pure_shock/,0,2021-08-23
"23 [M4F] A maid, mother-in-law, a manager &amp; many other desi Indian rp prompts","
1. **Suhaagrat in arranged marriage and further**- You have been married with a guy who you barely know. How do the think the first night will go? How do you think your life will be after that?

2. **Neglected mother x new son-in-law**- Your new son in law has been keeping your princess daughter happy beyond your imagination. However he is not shy in showing his affection for you, his old forgotten mother in law. Will you give in to his advances?

3. **Maami / maasi / chachi / any aunt x nephew** - He used to be the cute bright kid. Now he is the young man who is strong enough to pick you and carry you to the bedroom and successful enough to buy you anything you might want. Do you think its okay to share details of your boring marriage with him? Maybe your desires? Or maybe the fact that you know he checks you out?

4. **Team manager / lead x the junior colleague**- Managing or leading a team is always stressful. But it all can be managed if you can have a  little fun with them too. Maybe the shy junior guy, who has a thing for strong successful women like you. Come, use this boy toy.

5. **Maid x bachelor employer**- Bachelors are often not the ideal employers. They are usually dirty, messy and would ogle at you with red lust filled eyes. But they pay well and dont care about the quality of the work. Would you wanna work for a bachelor who is not a complete animal and actually is bold enough to show his interest in you with proper courting?

6. **Maid x employer's son** - What do you do when you find the young hot handsom son of the house where you work at, always staring at you and trying to flirt when no one is around?

7. **Girl x bestie's boyfriend**- Best friends for life. That means that her bf is your frnd yet always off limits. What if you catch him looking at you and trying to be close to you? What if she didn't know anything? What if you have something which she doesn't, something which he really really wants?

8. **Girl x guy best friend** - Girls and guys can be friends, even best friends. It usually gets awkward but its possible. You had such a friend in college but you guys fell apart as you got a bf and he got a gf. Or maybe he tried to objectify you, commented how big your boobs were. Fast forward a couple of years and some apologizing from him, you decide you need him back, as a frnd obviously. How will it go? Do you think you will find him attractive as well, given that he has become 10x hotter?

9. **Cousin sister x cousin brother**- Being the successful child means that you have to guide all the younger ones in the family. And now you have a 2 bhk flat, you have to share it with your younger cousin brother, who you haven't seen in years. Why - because he got a job in the same field aa you did, so far away from home. As his sister its your job to help him. Do you know he has had a massive crush on you all these years?

10. **Housewife x pervy neighbour** - Almost all men in their 20s are pervs. What do you do when you realise the guy living next to you, maybe alone or maybe with his family, is checking you out whenever you can see him. Do you put on a show for him? Or do you ask him to help around the house?

11. **Landlady x young hot tenant**- Nobody wants to host bachelors. Everyone knows why. However your hubby decided to let this one rent the 1bhk apartment on the top floor as he was smart, worked in a good company, respectful, looked clean, basically was a gentleman. He is a wolf in sheep's skin? Would he try to seduce the hot landlady? 

12. **Successful entrepreneur x inexperienced boy toy** - Who doesn't love attention? Being adored and worshipped. And more than that, getting all that from someone who knows how to respect you, is smart enough to match your intellectual level and open minded when it comes to bedroom. Basically someone who is willing to worship and please you, just the way you want. If you are a successful woman, finding a young man like him would mean all your stress melting away and better productivity, right?

13. **Professor x the bright student**- Cliche but true, all students fantasise about their hot professors. What do you do when you find out the smartest one in your class cant keep his bulge down when he is near you?

14. **Enemies**- We all have someone whom we hate. The mere sight of them turns our mood sour and makes us wanna kill them. What if you find yourself in close proximity of such a person from your last? Maybe he has become more obnoxious or hotter. Do you think you can channel all that hate into hate fuck?

15.  **The internet buyer** - You must have seen countless guys online asking for pics and numbers. One day you see a request from a guy asking if he can buy your used underwear/socks/ or  maybe your milk in exchange for good money. What do you think would happen if you reply to it?

[Help] Sudden behavior changes,"This is going to be a little long to explain all the context so please forgive me and thank you so much for reading it all. 

So my wife has never owned a dog before. Her family had 2 cats growing up but that's the extent of her pet ownership experience. She got really interested in a dog the more I talked about my childhood dogs and really wanted to try getting one. I told her I was down but I wanted to rescue an older dog so I didn't have to go through puppy phase for her first dog. We ended up rescuing aa 7 year old chihuahua/jack Russel female. She's fantastic! She was already house trained, crate trained, knew basic obedience commands and is super super mellow. She took to us right away, on our first meet she jumped into my wife's lap and started giving her kisses. 

We've had for for about 4 years now and it's been great. She loves cuddling with my wife, she'll lie on her lap for hours at a time if my wife will let her or she'll cuddle into the crook of my wife's legs she she's lying on the couch and go to sleep. My wife adores her and though she's close to me too and listens to me more when it comes to commands she's my wife's lapdog for sure. 

Now we rewind to Thursday. My wife got sick (not Covid thankfully.) But it's a respiratory infection of some sort, she's got a sore through and she's coughing/clearing her throat/coughing up phlegm a lot. Now this isn't the first time she's gotten sick in the last several years and it isn't the first time she's been coughing or clearing her throat a lot but something has changed dramatically with the dog. 

Suddenly our dog wants nothing to do with her. She'll only stay in the same room with my wife if I'm there, the second I leave she's with me. She won't lie on my wife or lie touching her, she gets as far on the other side of the couch as she can and watches her like a hawk, just stares at my wife non-stop. There are glimmers of the old dog, she still listens to commands and will come to my wife if she calls her but she leaves within a few seconds of coming to her and today when we came home from running a couple quick errands the dog was excited to see her, she jumped up on the arm of the couch and wanted pets from my wife, she even gave her a few kisses today and yesterday but overall she acts very reluctant/hesitant towards her. 

If my wife makes a noise such as taking a deep breath, coughing, or clearing her throat the dog reacts. She leans back, she jumps, or she opens her eyes really wide and moves away from my wife even further. In the past if she's with me in the evenings she is on a pillow in my office while I work but lately she has to be behind me. If I'm in my office she's lying on the floor behind my chair, if we are on the couch together she's behind me. She stays behind me and keeps her eyes open for my wife, looking down the hall or across the couch at her. 

Today she was in the hall when my wife came out of another room and the dog immediately darted into my office and got behind me again. Only 2 things have changed lately, my wife getting sick and she went back to work full time last week after being home everyday for over a year. I can't tell if the dog is mad or scared but she won't go near her alone. I tried to move her over to my wife tonight on the coach and she dropped her weight and leaned against me with all she had to try to stop me from moving her to my wife. 

It's breaking my wife's heart that her little lap partner doesn't want anything to do with her anymore and I'm getting increasingly more frustrated because I don't understand the sudden change and I can't fix it. Right now I'm just letting the dog do what she wants which is basically follow me around every place I go. I don't want to force her to be with my wife or anything because I don't want to reinforce this new fear or whatever it is or make her thing I'm being intentionally mean to her but I want things back the way they were. 

Tomorrow my wife is staying home sick and I'm going to work. I was off Thur/Fri and home with the dog so I'm interested to see how the day goes with the two of them alone together all day but I'm just feeling sad and stressed about this whole situation. It's been three and a half days of the dog hiding from my wife and staying glued to me. She's even reluctant to take food from my wife, she offered her a bite of her food tonight and the dog very, very slowly leaned towards her stretching head/neck towards my wife to take the food without moving her body closer to her at all. 

I may call the vet tomorrow. I know the suggestion of abuse will crop up somewhere, my wife's been at work for 2 weeks she hasn't been alone with the dog at all in almost 3 weeks. I have cameras in every room of our house and I've never seen anything other than her hugging and loving on this dog like it's her child so I no reason to suspect anything even remotely abusive has ever happened. 

If anyone has any insight or ideas I'd greatly, greatly appreciate it.",dogs,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/p9ud6f/help_sudden_behavior_changes/,[Help],AggressiveChihuahua,p9ud6f,/r/dogs/comments/p9ud6f/help_sudden_behavior_changes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/p9ud6f/help_sudden_behavior_changes/,0,2021-08-23
[M4F] A girl's furry best friend,"Hi there! Looking to try something a little different this time around.

You moved away from home  to study in college. But you quickly became lonely because it was difficult to make friends. You decide to get a pet. It could be a dog, or even something more magical (the setting can be decided upon later), maybe you're in plants.

Either way, you quickly fall in love with your new companion. Those long lonely nights are suddenly filled with furry cuddles and wet noses. But still, a girl has urges, you know?

One boring Saturday afternoon you're watching TV. It's a movie you haven't seen before. The actor is cute and well you're bored and horny. You slip your hand down there. Oh fuck that feels good! Suddenly your new pal is in the room. He's sniffing around. You shoo him away. Being a good boy he does that.

You throw your panties away and go to town on yourself. You cum hard. It's been so long. You quickly pass out in post orgasm bliss.

'Mmmm that feels good... Oh fuck yes' you awaken slightly your pussy is wet again. No it wasn't a dream something his licking your pussy. Oh no, it's your new pet! But ohhhh it feels so good. What the hell? Who will know? You grab your tits and let your new animal (or plant) friend go crazy on your pussy.

So that's about it! I'm looking to explore this fantasy with a willing partner. Do you let your friend make this a regular occurrence? Does someone find out? Maybe you discover like minded individuals and embark on a new life? Or maybe the pet takes over your life, dominating you at home.

Kinks : well, there are many so let's talk about them together.

Drop your pet in an emoji and let's talk. DM or chat ok!",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9v7rf/m4f_a_girls_furry_best_friend/,RP/Chat,soccerhero9,p9v7rf,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9v7rf/m4f_a_girls_furry_best_friend/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9v7rf/m4f_a_girls_furry_best_friend/,0,2021-08-23
Bi 22/f daddy daughter. A lot of kinks and very few almost no limits.,"Halloween - It's Halloween and I usually go to Halloween parties. every year while im you throw your own adult Halloween party. inviting a lot of friends. a lot of hooking up and swinging. i get bored at my party and decide to come home early. intrigued i decide to mingle. no one recognizes anybody due to the costumes (show me what I'm wearing) You won't recognize me until very late into it. Do I know it's you?

Corruption - Im your innocent daughter I always dress in modest clothes. This is driving you nuts. You can tell I have a great body but I never show it off. You have always considered taking advantage of me and my friends on my birthday. You arranged for it to be a girls only party. It looks innocent enough to me and the other girls and theyre parents. To us its like just another sleep over. Little do we know, you have several slutty outfits for me and my friends to change into for the night since ""no boys or parents but you are here"" we are allowed to wear more adult outfits that would be inappropriate any other time. While were upstairs changing your setting up the real party downstairs (what do you have set up? Invite people to be there when ee come down? show me what I'm wearing, try and piece a few outfits together to make the perfect one ) I am a very visual person and love pics regarding to the role. Like pics of the outfit or pics of what im doing or you're doing to me.

Christmas - It's Christmas Day and traditionally you wake up and go down to open presents however I guess this year I was put on santa's naughty list I wake up beside me there is a note and an outfit saying Hey Baby girl when you wake up put this on and come downstairs to open your presents I have a huge surprise for you. Right next to the note I look and there is this outfit for me to put on (show me the outfit you left for me, the sexier the better) Confused I look at the letter and read it again and then look back to the outfit not sure why I'm wearing something like this but go ahead and put it on anyways then head downstairs and see a Christmas tree with tons of presents underneath it, And a look around the living Room seeing a bunch of family and some people I dont know as well. What's going on I asked looking over at you. Not sure where this role could go kinda leaving it open from this point forward to see what you have in mind was kinda thinking the presents under the tree were all dirty! Maybe pills to make me a bimbo, boobs grow, super horny etc. Lingerie, sext toys, etc. Be creative let's make this something new and exciting

Poker night - It's your monthly poker night with your buddies. I've always grown up with the group of guys, some family, friends your co workers etc, and I've always wanted to join in and see how I do. I have suggested it quite a bit and you know the guys like me, so you decided to let me participate as a server (more of a distraction) you pick out a real slutty outfit to wear for them as I am supposed to bring them beer hordorves etc. After a while I continue to show I want to play and I'm given the opportunity. Using my tip money from tonight to buy in. As we're playing I lose all of my money and one of the guys jokingly suggest that I can bet my clothes and body if I want to keep going. It then evolves from there.

Bachelor party (#2 favorite right now) Im your daughter soon to be married in a hotel for a bachelor party. You have me hiding away in a bathroom while you get the party comfortable and let them get ready for tonights activities when I come out in wedding lingerie (show me, make it sexy, piece a few things together). The groom is unaware I am the evening's entertainment and I will be shared with everyone there. (Maybe I'm not alone and have a friend/friends with me)

Sleep Over (#3 favorite right now) - you have allowed me to have a few friends over this weekend for a sleep over. While my friends are occupied downstairs you sneak into my room and take all of our clothes and hide them replacing the clothes in their bags and the ones in my dresser and closet with slutty outfits you bought for each of us. Then lay out barely there swimsuits for each of us on my bed and suggest we go upstairs and change and go swim in the pool. - this scene could go anywhere as you have several outfits for us to change in as it advances. Starting with us swimming while you and a few friends and/or family are setting up inside for the next thing.

Sex Demon (My favorite right now) I am your teenage girl dabbling into witchcraft for the first time. Just curious to what powers I could possess. Living a few hours from Salam bright lore and mythology with it. Rumors of wiccan powers and the ability to alter oneself. A curiosity got the better of me, exploring an artform I didn't understand. After stealing from a metaphysics store I brought home pagan sage, a small pocketsized cast iron cauldron, and a handful of loose keys. Most unfortunately, I also helped herself to a vile of saturated oils. The liquid black and viscous. While the small decrepit shop owner wasn't looking, I pocketed the substance and quickly scampered away from the store, excited to bring fortune and beauty my way. Getting home taking inventory of what I got somehow unleashes a power I'm not ready for. The idea would play a lot on manipulation, corruption, group play, incest, whatever, the thought being that the demon/entity I release starts to corrupt me to do things I wouldn't normally do, all while I am still present and there but I am drawn to him whispering into my ear. Eventually looking to fulfill sexual desires of his and now my own.

I love group sex and whoring me out to your friends as that is a big turn on of mine. I'm into everything but scat and pee. Love group, public, anal, cum play, corruption, humiliation, impregnation, and even a BIG fan of some beastiality (not ridiculous like a rhino or unicorn or something stupid) basically anything! Don't be afraid to push the limits. I like to be called names and humiliated some but of course not right away. Looking for a detailed daddy that takes control but not too demanding. Message me if you think you can keep up. I have already set it up you start! try and stand out so I respond. Don't just say ''Hey,'' set us up from there and let me know what kinks you into and want to add in. Something to get my attention and turn me on to respond ;p if I haven't responded, you didn't get my attention. I get a lot of messages. If it dont set up the role from where I left off I won't respond. Please set us up! STAND OUT! Please list your kinks and limits too. Message me for my kick. I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+.

My Father Threatened To Murder Me and My Family Conspired To Keep It Quiet," Here is my story:

&amp;#x200B;

It is coming together as a big picture. 

It all start a year ago when my father threatened to murder me on a military base in Ontario, near the capital region of Canada where I was living at the time. Or maybe the story starts with the war in Afghanistan, or 9/11 because I swear my life has been fucked up ever since that day. 

 My father told me he would slit my throat and that he had killed 17 people and would kill me too, would not hesitate, and is very good at it. I hid in my room for two days then forced him to drive me back to the city where I lived and never saw him again. A few weeks later I went to my home city because my sister was getting married and started reaching out to family members for support and action. Every single person silenced me. My grandfather instructed me to stay silent to protect my father, my sister told me if I had a problem I could leave forever. My uncle told me it is normal for a man to act that way, my aunt did nothing, and manipulated me into getting over it. A cousin would stay dead silent everytime I spoke about it. Anytime I spoke about it people would talk about putting me in a psychiatric facility.

 7 ish months ago I finally called the Military Police. They intimidated me, told me I could not give a statement, and sent me to a police department they knew would not help. I tried my local police, they said they were sending officers to interview me, they never showed up, never called, were supposed to call. I gave up for a long time. A week or so ago I decided to start speaking out against the family members who silenced me and told them if they did admit to the coverup and help me find support and take action I would go to the police. They started calling the police on me every time I spoke about the abuse, the coverup, and telling them I was a danger to myself and crazy and attempted to intimidate me, silence me, delegitimize me, and confine me to a psych ward. But the police started believing me immediately and the next day I filed a full police report. They called the police on me again, told my story for the 6th or 7th time and convinced them I wasn't crazy. Later that night the police call, tell me It's all over, there will be no investigation.

So I call another department. They refuse to help. So I call the FIRST department, military police where I had started and they take me seriously STRAIGHT AWAY. I have an active case number. My family told me I'm crazy, that they never were going to stand up for me and I belong in a mental hospital and then all blocked me. Everyone. Aunt uncle sister cousins grandparents ALLL GONE. But I have an active police investigation and an independent journalist who is interested in my story.

 I have contacted all three major Canadian news stations but have not yet heard back. My father is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and he has PTSD and is unstable and is dangerous to himself and the public. I have seen him threaten people in public so many times. they did NOT protect the public.

 I told my family I will not stop speaking out against the way they coverup child abuse. We have a family history related to this: My mother's father murder her mother and committed suicide in front of his children and they REFUSE to take this seriously. Infact my uncle, her brother told me it is totally normal for a man to do that to his family. 

So I am returning to the capital in one week and beginning to fight a lengthy legal and media campaign against my father, My entire extended family network on both sides, my police, federal government, and military. I will attempt to organize with other discarded veterans and military families in the capital. I lost my job due to stress. I am now penniless. Nothing left in the world, but someone has offered me a place to stay and i had travel points saved on my card.

At one point I became so hopeless I am almost drank myself to death and wound up in a detox centre. Which ended up being a great thing because as of last week I am 4 months sober.

[35M4F] Homewrecker,"Hi there ladies of DPP!  
  
Today I'm looking for a nasty, kinky homewrecker to come break up my unhappy marriage. I've got a couple of ideas in mind, but would love to discuss further with anyone interested in private. I'd love to involve some sort of light mind control/hypnosis and have this be very anally focused. Those are not deal breakers, but just items that I think would be fun to include. I'd also love to include a lot of dirty talk around how much better than my wife you are. Below are a few potential prompts and character references, but as I said, I'm open to just about anything as long as it doesn't include force, scat or blood. Looking forward to hearing from you!  
  
**Idea 1 - The Nanny**  
  
You had come to us highly recommended and after about 10 different interviews with various other older women, I was sold. You were attractive. There was no other way to put it and while my wife didn't come out and say it, I could tell she wasn't very comfortable with having you in the house around me. I'd never strayed before, but since my company recently closed its offices and moved all of us to working remote full time, we needed a nanny to watch the little ones while I was downstairs squirreled away in my home office. It had only been two weeks, but I already couldn't focus on work. Your teasing and open flirting had left me in disbelief and of course I couldn't tell my wife about it...  
  
**Idea 2 - The In-Law**  
  
Your sister had married one of the good ones. Your family rubbed it in every chance that they got. She was always the golden child though. The favorite. ""Why can't you be more like your sister?"" was uttered at almost every family get together. Finally you decided to show your perfect prissy little sister just how to treat a man. When she complained to you about me, you rolled your eyes. What woman wouldn't want to put out with someone as endowed as me you thought to yourself. Well that's it, no more, its time to take what you want and put your sister in her place.  
  
**Idea 3 - The Therapist**  
  
My wife and I had only been married for 5 years, but the sex had already dried up. We decided to see a specialized therapist to see what we could do about it. It seemed a little odd that we were meeting with her separately, but who was I to judge? I was willing to try just about anything to save my marriage. I didn't realize until too late that you were willing to do just about anything to sabotage it...

5 Things,"Powell‚Äôs big week, mixed PMI data, and Bitcoin tops $50,000. 

Good start  
Much of the market‚Äôs attention this week will be focused on Friday‚Äôs speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium. Last year he rolled out a new way of running monetary policy, including allowing an overshoot in inflation. A year on, concerns are being raised that the policy is already past its sell-by date with inflation stubbornly higher than the bank‚Äôs policy target. There was some good news for Powell when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was said to endorse him for a second term. 

Growth 
The mixed fortunes in battling the pandemic around the world is evident in this morning‚Äôs PMI data. Activity in Japan‚Äôs service sector shrunk at the fastest pace in 15 months as restrictions to combat the Covid-19 wave hit businesses. In Europe, manufacturing was outperformed by services for the first time since the pandemic took hold, with factories struggling to keep up with demand in August due to shortages of components and transportation difficulties. Services PMI for the U.K. came in lower than forecast with companies blaming staff shortages. PMI data for the U.S. economy, published at 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time, is expected to show a slight moderation in the pace of growth. 

$50k 
Bitcoin rose above $50,000 for the first time since May as cryptocurrencies continue their recovery from the rout that saw the original digital token drop below $30,000 a little over a month ago. As the old saying goes, there‚Äôs nothing like price to change sentiment, so predictions of Bitcoin $100k are back in vogue. The rise of the asset has pushed through some technical levels, adding to bullish sentiment, while Paypal Inc.‚Äôs decision to allow U.K. customers make crypto transactions is also helping. 

Markets rise
Global investors are getting the week off to a positive start as they look for bargains after last week‚Äôs drop in equities. Overnight the MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 1.3% while Japan‚Äôs Topix index closed 1.8% higher. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index had added 0.4% by 5:50 a.m. with retailers among the best performers. S&amp;P 500 futures pointed to a similar gain at the open, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.282%, oil was back over $64 a barrel and gold was higher. 

Coming up... 
The Chicago Fed National Activity Index for July is at 8:30 a.m. PMI data is at 9:45 a.m. and existing home sales numbers for July are at 10:00 a.m. Peru‚Äôs second quarter GDP is expected to come in at more than 40%. JD.com Inc., FinVolution Group., Palo Alto Networks Inc. and Ferroglobe PLC are among the companies reporting results. 

What we've been reading
Here's what caught our eye over the weekend. 

Odd Lots: A conversation with Ajmal Ahmady, Afghanistan‚Äôs former central bank chief. 
China hits zero Covid cases with a month of draconian curbs.
Merkel struggles to wrap up unfinished business with Putin.
Hurricane Henri got tripped up by a storm near Pennsylvania. 
Michael Burry‚Äôs pretty big short hinges on Treasuries sinking. 
ECB rate hike bets are losing out to still-dim inflation outlook.
How big data carried graph theory to new dimensions. 
And finally, here‚Äôs what Justina‚Äôs interested in this morning
In terms of stock-market internals, it feels like we‚Äôre now somewhere between the pre-2021 years and the first quarter, when the equity dislocations exacerbated by Covid started to close and a broader swath of stocks rose. Now those spreads have narrowed from extremes and the euphoria over the economic re-opening has started to wane. That‚Äôs led to some mixed performance in shares. The value factor has rolled over but also stabilized since plunging in June.

Hedge funds moved back to growth stocks from value in the second quarter, according to Goldman Sachs strategists. Among all sectors they added most to tech, though they also put more money in some cyclical sectors. Short interest in the median S&amp;P 500 stock also dropped to 1.5%, matching the record low near the peak of the dot-com bubble -- a sign of bullish sentiment but also potentially a sign no one quite knows what to bet against at this moment.

The cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 has rebounded lately versus the equal-weighted version, a sign the largest stocks -- usually tech/growth names -- are leading gains again. The Russell 2000 has been underperforming the large-cap benchmark since March.

In short, we‚Äôre seeing a tentative return to a market dominated more by the growth mega-caps, but not driven by much conviction. With the delta variant spreading, economic worries are growing again, but at the same time, with the Fed pondering tapering its stimulus, bond yields could go higher again in a development that‚Äôs favored value over growth in recent years. It makes sense to have a bit of both.

Issues with my mother,"Trigger Warning: abuse, neglect, alcohol 
This will be a long one

My (24f) mum (48f) has always difficult. 
For a little context:
Growing up, she was never all that affectionate, was always drunk and was in and out of relationships. She was rarely single and the majority of the time would have a new man lined up before leaving the last. She'd ignore my brother (21m) and I's existence and tell us to go away when her boyfriend was around. Her boyfriends weren't all bad, but most of them were dodgy people who shouldn't be around children. This all stems from her childhood trauma, which is a whole different story. She'd also hit, kick, bite us etc, if we did something 'wrong'. 

My brother from a very young age had behavioural issues. He has ADHD and autism, possibly some other issues undiagnosed. We didn't get on very well. We fought for our mums attention. He was physically abusive towards my mother and myself at times when he couldn't control his anger. He'd break things, destroy the house, steal money etc. He was rarely told off or faced any consequences. Only physically. He pretty much got away with everything because that was easier for my mum. He always gotten everything he's wanted. 

When I was 13/14, I had to move in with grandparents (who were the most amazing people) due to the fact my brother did not want me living at home. Rather than defending me and telling my brother no, my mum just went ahead with it. 

Obviously I have a lot of resentment and trauma related to these things. As a result, I have borderline personality disorder. I had issues growing up, but getting help for my brothers issues were always the priority. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 22 years old. I'm in therapy currently. I also have 2 children from before I was diagnosed. 

My mother is still very much the same as she was then. She's still in and out of relationships all of the time, she becomes all about them. Doesn't make much time for family, etc. She still drinks a lot, not every day, but also denies she has a problem with it. 

My mother got into a relationship with a man (35m) in January, after a month and even before meeting me, he'd asked her if I'd be willing to be a surrogate for him and have his baby. She joked about it and obviously I said no and it was weird. A while later, she brings it up again and asked if I'd be willing to do it for her. I promptly ignored her for days, my brother explained to her why and she lost it with me, calling me all sorts of names. I blocked her and didn't talk to her for months. She broke up with the boyfriend after he cheated on her with an 18 year old and got someone else pregnant. 

A couple of months ago, she contacted me to talk to me. She was distraught and asked if we could meet up and talk about things. I said yes. She apologised and said she'd realised how much she'd messed up over the years, after my aunt told her everything I had confessed about my childhood. 
I'd never seen her so broken and upset. I'd put a few boundaries in place and even told her I'm nowhere near 100% forgiving her, that we have a lot to work through. She agreed. On her own accord, she mentioned how she was done with dating and that she wanted to put her family first. 

Things had actually been pretty good between us, we were seeing each other regularly and making progress. 

Yesterday she came over and told me she had something to tell me. She's seeing someone and has been for a little while.  She said I don't have to meet him and she won't bring him around my children either. She's apparently also told him that I won't ever want to meet him. She started crying and saying how she couldn't cope if she lost me and my children again. 
*I'm in no way saying she's not allowed to date or be in relationships* but it hurts a little bit. 
It makes me feel like everything she said is a lie and that she really doesn't care about how I feel or working through our relationship. 

Is it worth telling her how I really feel? Or should I cut contact with her instead? 
How do I go about all of this? Are my feelings valid? Any other advice is welcome. 
I'm going to talk to my therapist about it as well, but she's on annual leave for a couple of weeks. 

Tldr: abusive mum put men before my brother and I all of our lives, I have trauma related to it. I cut contact with her due to it for a while, we started to work on our relationship and now I feel she's doing the same thing again.",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/p9ypyv/issues_with_my_mother/,,ThrowRA666ix,p9ypyv,/r/relationship_advice/comments/p9ypyv/issues_with_my_mother/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/p9ypyv/issues_with_my_mother/,0,2021-08-23

Bi 22/f daddy can you fill me with your seed?,"Halloween - It's Halloween and I usually go to Halloween parties. every year while im you throw your own adult Halloween party. inviting a lot of friends. a lot of hooking up and swinging. i get bored at my party and decide to come home early. intrigued i decide to mingle. no one recognizes anybody due to the costumes (show me what I'm wearing) You won't recognize me until very late into it. Do I know it's you?

Corruption - Im your innocent daughter I always dress in modest clothes. This is driving you nuts. You can tell I have a great body but I never show it off. You have always considered taking advantage of me and my friends on my birthday. You arranged for it to be a girls only party. It looks innocent enough to me and the other girls and theyre parents. To us its like just another sleep over. Little do we know, you have several slutty outfits for me and my friends to change into for the night since ""no boys or parents but you are here"" we are allowed to wear more adult outfits that would be inappropriate any other time. While were upstairs changing your setting up the real party downstairs (what do you have set up? Invite people to be there when ee come down? show me what I'm wearing, try and piece a few outfits together to make the perfect one ) I am a very visual person and love pics regarding to the role. Like pics of the outfit or pics of what im doing or you're doing to me.

Christmas - It's Christmas Day and traditionally you wake up and go down to open presents however I guess this year I was put on santa's naughty list I wake up beside me there is a note and an outfit saying Hey Baby girl when you wake up put this on and come downstairs to open your presents I have a huge surprise for you. Right next to the note I look and there is this outfit for me to put on (show me the outfit you left for me, the sexier the better) Confused I look at the letter and read it again and then look back to the outfit not sure why I'm wearing something like this but go ahead and put it on anyways then head downstairs and see a Christmas tree with tons of presents underneath it, And a look around the living Room seeing a bunch of family and some people I dont know as well. What's going on I asked looking over at you. Not sure where this role could go kinda leaving it open from this point forward to see what you have in mind was kinda thinking the presents under the tree were all dirty! Maybe pills to make me a bimbo, boobs grow, super horny etc. Lingerie, sext toys, etc. Be creative let's make this something new and exciting

Poker night - It's your monthly poker night with your buddies. I've always grown up with the group of guys, some family, friends your co workers etc, and I've always wanted to join in and see how I do. I have suggested it quite a bit and you know the guys like me, so you decided to let me participate as a server (more of a distraction) you pick out a real slutty outfit to wear for them as I am supposed to bring them beer hordorves etc. After a while I continue to show I want to play and I'm given the opportunity. Using my tip money from tonight to buy in. As we're playing I lose all of my money and one of the guys jokingly suggest that I can bet my clothes and body if I want to keep going. It then evolves from there.

Bachelor party - Im your daughter soon to be married in a hotel for a bachelor party. You have me hiding away in a bathroom while you get the party comfortable and let them get ready for tonights activities when I come out in wedding lingerie (show me, make it sexy, piece a few things together). The groom is unaware I am the evening's entertainment and I will be shared with everyone there. (Maybe I'm not alone and have a friend/friends with me)

Sleep Over - you have allowed me to have a few friends over this weekend for a sleep over. While my friends are occupied downstairs you sneak into my room and take all of our clothes and hide them replacing the clothes in their bags and the ones in my dresser and closet with slutty outfits you bought for each of us. Then lay out barely there swimsuits for each of us on my bed and suggest we go upstairs and change and go swim in the pool. - this scene could go anywhere as you have several outfits for us to change in as it advances. Starting with us swimming while you and a few friends and/or family are setting up inside for the next thing.

Sex Demon (My favorite right now) I am your teenage girl dabbling into witchcraft for the first time. Just curious to what powers I could possess. Living a few hours from Salam bright lore and mythology with it. Rumors of wiccan powers and the ability to alter oneself. A curiosity got the better of me, exploring an artform I didn't understand. After stealing from a metaphysics store I brought home pagan sage, a small pocketsized cast iron cauldron, and a handful of loose keys. Most unfortunately, I also helped herself to a vile of saturated oils. The liquid black and viscous. While the small decrepit shop owner wasn't looking, I pocketed the substance and quickly scampered away from the store, excited to bring fortune and beauty my way. Getting home taking inventory of what I got somehow unleashes a power I'm not ready for. The idea would play a lot on manipulation, corruption, group play, incest, whatever, the thought being that the demon/entity I release starts to corrupt me to do things I wouldn't normally do, all while I am still present and there but I am drawn to him whispering into my ear. Eventually looking to fulfill sexual desires of his and now my own.
I love group sex and whoring me out to your friends as that is a big turn on of mine. I'm into everything but scat and pee. Love group, public, anal, cum play, corruption, humiliation, impregnation, and even a BIG fan of some beastiality (not ridiculous like a rhino or unicorn or something stupid) basically anything! Don't be afraid to push the limits. I like to be called names and humiliated some but of course not right away. Looking for a detailed daddy that takes control but not too demanding. Message me if you think you can keep up. I have already set it up you start! try and stand out so I respond. Don't just say ''Hey,'' set us up from there and let me know what kinks you into and want to add in. Something to get my attention and turn me on to respond ;p if I haven't responded, you didn't get my attention. I get a lot of messages. If it dont set up the role from where I left off I won't respond. Please set us up! STAND OUT! Please list your kinks and limits too. Message me for my kick. I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+. Would be really cool to do this with multiple people",FamilyRP,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyRP/comments/p9xfh7/bi_22f_daddy_can_you_fill_me_with_your_seed/,,bikittykat,p9xfh7,/r/FamilyRP/comments/p9xfh7/bi_22f_daddy_can_you_fill_me_with_your_seed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyRP/comments/p9xfh7/bi_22f_daddy_can_you_fill_me_with_your_seed/,0,2021-08-23

[M4F][Discord][21+] - Long-Term Romance Partner,"Hello all! I'm Jay I've been roleplaying seriously for around 8 years. I'll spare the boring spiel about myself and cut right to the chase and what I'm looking for. I'm seeking a long-term roleplaying partner to explore some plot driven romance scenarios. I really value the development between the characters and the relationship that builds between them. I definitely enjoy drama and dark themes for a solid, gritty story that isn't some Hallmark cookie cutter. Below I have some ideas, universes, and previous roleplays that I have done that can be a starting point for the plot we can discuss. They aren't a hard requirement for me and I welcome new ideas. I appreciate a partner I can brainstorm with and mutually build a world with. I also have some expectations that are a bit more important as well. They're not hard requirements, but definitely appreciated.

*My Ideas*

**A World Forever Changed** - 50 years after the civilization and society collapsed along with the near extinction of humanity, life has slowly gotten back to some form of what it once was. While things are nowhere near ""normal"" Earth is now habitable. However, civilization itself is far from its former glory. The world is now dog-eat-dog, kill or be killed. The once repressed primal instinct of man is now a survival trait. Those not mentally tough enough to fend for themselves don't make it. I'm a scavenger that moves from settlement to settlement, either trading what I have to survive or resting for some time before my next venture.

**Colony Zero** - I'm a prisoner in the notorious Colony Zero prison, a massive prison hundreds of miles away from any city or town. It has 5 ""houses"", warehouse sized living units that a large amount of prisoners reside. Each house has a leader. As billionaire CEOs and politicians kept getting richer, they found that its easier to make massive prisons to lock up any and everybody they want to silence or disappear. They lock you up, throw away the key, and answer no questions. Once inside, consider yourself a ghost. You're dead to the outside world and won't ever been seen again. Colony Zero is once of these prisons. Because of this, they're almost exclusively ran by the inmates. After keeping up a successful blog that exposed a couple CEOs, I finally got my one way ticket to the prison. I'm no criminal by any means, but I'm no pushover either. After years of getting my hands dirty to survive, I earned my stripes and got hand picked to lead one of the houses. You're the newest addition to the house and it's my job to make sure you understand how things work. Will you be another pawn and serve a clean sentence? Or will you join in on the harsh realities of the prison and get your hands dirty? Either way, Colony Zero will make sure you wish you were in hell.

*Universes/Fandoms*

Anything in bold are my go to universes that I have extensive knowledge on and/or are my favorites.

- **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood**
- **Jujutsu Kaisen** (anime only, no manga knowledge)
- **My Hero Academia** (anime only, no manga knowledge)
- Star Wars (Super basic knowledge, honestly)
- **Fallout**
- **Skyrim**
- The Legend of Zelda
- **Fire Emblem: Three Houses**
- Detroit Become Human
- **Mass Effect**

*Previous Roleplays*

The Crucible - A distant future, sci-fi roleplay in space where we play new recruits aboard one of the toughest ships that train society‚Äôs undesirables into top tier soldiers. Set in the year 2350, humanity has expanded further into the Milky Way and has established civilization amongst aliens and other extraterrestrial life. We either start during their training or during their actual service, and live the life of a soldier. Tons of opportunities to dive into solid plots that can go in any direction!

The Hitchhiker - After my life falls apart, I decide to go on a cross country road trip. Once I hit the road, I come across you. A hitchhiker with problems of your own, I decide to bring you along. We bond well and find ourselves depending on each other far more than we intended to.

*Expectations*

**Age** - First and foremost, please be at least 21 years of age. These roleplays are definitely heavy on adult themes and I prefer to have a mature roleplay partner.

**Romance** - These roleplays all have a heavy theme of romance present and therefore are a hard requirement. Our characters are going to end up together one way or another. How we get to that point is all dependent on the roleplay. On top of this, I do incorporate some NSFW scenes as well *however* I do not want them to be the focus. I use scenes like these for a more engaging and realistic roleplay. I'm not against fade to black if you're not comfortable writing such scenes.

**Time and Schedule** - I unfortunately do not have endless amounts of time daily to roleplay and my job can be very demanding. Because of this, I have a bit of a schedule for roleplaying. I'm available almost all day Monday through Thursday, but Fridays and the weekend are usually far too busy for me because of my job. I live in the US and I'm in PST. I do take a while to reply when I'm not at home, typing on mobile is a bit of a buzzkill and I prefer typing on my PC. If you're expecting a reply almost immediately after you do, you're out of luck.

**Discord** - Discord is a must for me. The ability to create a separate server to stay organized and separate OOC chat from the roleplay just makes things so much easier. I prefer us having actual character sheets as well to be able to reference details provided in them as well as having notes of plot developments/major roleplay events. Off topic chat is definitely welcomed and appreciated as well. I really enjoy making friends out of my partners. It is not a requirement of course.

**Roleplaying** - I strongly prefer having thoroughly written and detailed responses. One-liners are a hard no and will effectively make me lose interest. You don't need to write a massive wall of text every time, I usually only write 3-4 paragraphs on average, but the more detail the better.

Thank you so much for reading all of this information and making it to the end! I'm sure it was a bit extra. Please PM me or send a Reddit chat my way if you're interested! Feel free to ask any questions and share your ideas as well!",RoleplayPartnerSearch,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/p9znss/m4fdiscord21_longterm_romance_partner/,M4F,theycallmejay-,p9znss,/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/p9znss/m4fdiscord21_longterm_romance_partner/,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/p9znss/m4fdiscord21_longterm_romance_partner/,0,2021-08-23
[M4Aplaying female] blacking the animal girls,"
The Adorable animal girl shop!

This rp will be a lovely scene at which you play a animal girl! You are free to bring a anthro reference or just a regular human girl with animal ears and tail!  Nekos and such like that! (I have references for the nekos) in this rp you will be playing the girl in which I want to adopt! For this rp I would prefer the girl be short! Chubby short petite short! Body type is up to you I just prefer the height stay at 5‚Äô or below!(size play kink)

As for the starting to this scene! I would be playing a black male named Austin (reference will be given ) he is 28 and looking for one of these pet girls after stumbling upon the shop one drunken night on his way home! Going back in the morning to take a look! 

Now as this rp does sound very light hearted I have two version.. full dark non con and lighter dub con version! For this rp I would prefer not to have full consent 

For the dark non con scene there is some rules.. for this darker version  unrealistic cock size Is a must kink and so is sexual pain! As for the scene  this is it!

Dark scene:as I walked into the shop there was only one thing on my mind.. I heard girls that lived in these type of shops had amazing body‚Äôs.. as well as their holes were always tight due to them have long healing ability‚Äôs! This making it impossible to make them loose! This making them the perfect little toys for people like me a man that suffers from a rare medical issue that caused my cock to be unrealistically long and thick! And I planed your do nothing.. but use and abuse you.. 

Dub-con scene:in this scene it will see me as a more hung bastard in need of a loving needy pet! Of course the idea is these girls are the best for sex.. but they are also human like in that they need love and attention.. well that‚Äôs where the idea of tricking them comes into play as my character will pretend to be as loving and caring as he can just so that he can roughly and hardly make his new pet take his cock once in bed! 

Below are my kinks and limits I would like if you pick at least one of the sub categories to play from and if you like some from one of the others let me know!

My kinks are anal,ass to mouth, , sloppy/messy oral and face fucking, , innocent girls, non con,  degrading and humiliation , bigger on small. And cock worship
 
Sub categories!
A: unrealistic cocks 18+ inches, stomach bulge and sexual pain nothing better then big cocks causing pain, rimming my ass love when girls eat guy butt
B:toilet play all of it vomit to scat farting all of it , musk/smell play, heavy degradation
C: monsters furry or anthro! No human in a fur suit! Only pure bread monsters and beast.. nothing but weird cocks knots flared horse cocks and large penetrations, this also will have sexual pain , ear sex

It is I! A person who you've probably never seen before!

Today I present to all of you my first script posted to the guild! And what could be more appropriate for a guild than a fantasy-themed script? I'm planning for this to be a three-part script, so I'm also looking for some feedback for future installments. This is much longer than all of my other scripts, and written quite differently. I hope that you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it! Thanks so much for stopping by!

Pet names: &gt;!Handsome, Dear, Sweetheart, Sweet Boy!&lt;

  
Synopsis: You hear a knock at the door from ironclad hands. Upon opening, you see none other than your childhood friend, bearing the armor of a knight! You knew that this day would come ever since she left for the academy four years ago, while you were already busy with learning your magecraft. During this time, you two grew into powerful fighters in different respects. However, there is not all good news. Your friend has been marked as a sacrifice by the Earth to prevent unspeakable evil from wreaking havoc on all mankind. Her power has grown considerably to help her on her journey, but she cannot do it alone. She needs you, the closest friend she's ever known. But my, she's grown quite beautiful during her stay at the academy. And you've really grown into your looks since she last saw you. Buried, tangled emotions unravel and start to fly free!

  
K = Knight  
  
(A knock on the door in the early morning alerts the Listener. He goes to investigate the noise, only to be greeted by his grown childhood friend)  
  
K (Surprised, perhaps crying a bit): Oh my, you‚Äôre still here. I can‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs been so long. Is that really you, my friend?  
  
(Listener recognizes K and they share a warm hug)  
  
K: It truly has been much too long. I‚Äôm so glad that I managed to find you again. (Laughing) You look so handsome in your mage‚Äôs robes. (Sigh) Look, I have‚Ä¶ a favor to ask of you. Can I come in?  
  
(Listener agrees and lets K inside)  
  
K (Reserved): Let‚Äôs take a seat, this might be a bit of an explanation.  
  
(Listener and K take a seat at the table, Listener expresses his concern)  
  
K: Please, friend, do not be worried. I have been‚Ä¶ summoned for duty, for lack of better phrasing. Do you remember when we learned about the Praetor‚Äôs Burden during our pre-academy training? (Deep breath) I suppose it has been a while, so I‚Äôll regale it for you: Every one hundred years, a child is chosen by the Earth to act as it‚Äôs protector. When that very child awakens to their power, they become immensely strong and are sent off to the East, to the mountain that holds The Gate. There they will... sacrifice themselves and fade away from this world just as they entered it. To do otherwise would be to allow that Gate to open, and unleash the horrors of the other side onto the world for a century. It is the Praetor‚Äôs Burden to be that sacrifice, only their power can stop The Gate from opening.  
  
(Listener states that he remembers)  
  
K: (Laughs) Well of course you remember now, I recited it word for word, you miscreant.  
  
(Listener asks why she brought it up)  
  
K (Halfhearted): Well, I bring this matter to you because‚Ä¶ I am the new Praetor.   
  
(Listener looks at her in disbelief)  
  
K: (Laughing) I recognize that face of doubt. You showed it to me often when we were young. The last time I saw it was when I told you that I was becoming a knight. (Laughing again) Oh, the look on your face was adorable. You couldn‚Äôt believe that your little friend that used to wander the forest with you was going off to become an iron-clad defender. (Pause) But now, I sit before you, in my very own armor, with a sword at my hip. So, I must ask you, my friend, is this really so hard to believe?  
  
(Listener still doesn‚Äôt believe her)  
  
K (Serious): I know, it‚Äôs... difficult to accept. But you read the books just as I did. Look at my eyes. They‚Äôre silver now. You know that they weren‚Äôt before. They were green. Like the grass of the fields, you told me. I loved that. But, now they aren‚Äôt. They share a color with my blade. The same color described in the Praetor legend.   
  
(Listener is taken aback, but believes her now)  
  
K (Happy): Thank you for believing me. I‚Äôve already shown the masters at the academy. They‚Äôre getting my provisions ready as we speak. That‚Äôs why I came here. Not to say goodbye or anything like that. No, I came to ask you for something‚Ä¶ else. I don‚Äôt expect you to agree, but I wanted to at least try before I left.  
  
(Listener agrees without hearing)  
  
K (Taken aback): That‚Äôs very sweet of you, but I insist that I tell you what the favor is before you agree to it.  
  
(Listener nods, letting her speak)  
  
K: I‚Ä¶ I want you to come with me. The academy offered a legion of my fellow knights to escort me, but I refused them. If I‚Äôm to pass from this world, I don‚Äôt want to do it surrounded by acquaintances that only follow me because they‚Äôre being paid to do so. I want to leave this world in the company of my closest friend, you.  
  
(K takes a deep breath)  
  
K: I know it‚Äôs been years, and it may be too much to ask you to uproot yourself and come on an adventure so suddenly, but‚Ä¶ I need you to be there for me. I don‚Äôt think that I can do it on my own. Please‚Ä¶ I-  
  
(The Listener wholeheartedly agrees to accompany her)  
  
K (Crying): T-Thank you. Thank you so much. I feel so much better now.   
  
(K stands up from the table, exhaling)  
  
K: Say your goodbyes for now, we will need to leave soon. I‚Äôll have the officers prepare a horse and equipment for you. Do you need anything specific?  
  
(Listener replies no)  
  
K (Serious): Good, meet me at the gates in an hour. Be ready for a long journey. I‚Äôll see you then.  
  
(Long pause to indicate time passes)  
  
K (Happy to see the Listener): You actually came! I should never have doubted you. You were always by my side when I needed you. Are you ready to go? I see your books, do you‚Ä¶ use those for your magic?  
  
(Listener tells her that they are recipe books)  
  
K: (Laughter) Recipe books?!? Are you going to ward off thieves and wolves with a nice, hot stew? You always were a jester, even when we were younger.  
  
(The Listener indicates that he is serious and explains that he uses his hands to cast magic)  
  
K: Ah, you use your hands to cast. I see, so those are actually recipe books? I don‚Äôt know how many of those will prove to be useful with the provisions we were given, but I suppose we can do some hunting and foraging on our way. I hope that you aren‚Äôt thinking that I‚Äôll be doing the cooking, I‚Äôm about as good with a ladle as I am with a wand. There‚Äôs a reason why I chose to be a knight.   
  
(Listener explains that he will be preparing the food)  
  
K: Well that‚Äôs a relief. Wait, when did you have the time to learn to cook? I thought you mages kept your noses firmly stuck between the pages of research tomes, not culinary books.  
  
(Listener explains that he minored in cooking)  
  
K (Teasing): (Laughter) You minored in culinary arts? That‚Äôs quite adorable. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be a lovely house-husband one day, my friend.   
  
(Listener‚Äôs becomes (in)visibly annoyed)  
  
K: (Laughter) Oh, don‚Äôt look at me like that! You know I‚Äôm just teasing you.   
  
K (Serious): I apologize, I didn‚Äôt mean to cause offense. Really, you know that you‚Äôre my greatest friend. I respect you and your arts a great deal. I would not have asked for you to accompany me if this were not the case.   
  
(Listener tells K that he forgives her)  
  
K (Warmly): You were always so forgiving. A quality that I respect just as much as your intelligence. Thank you, my friend. Regardless, are you prepared to leave? Are those robes warm enough for the mountain trail, or should we head through the forest? The map details a number of routes we can take, I think that the mountain trail will be fastest but-  
  
(Listener interrupts her, telling her to not worry so much about it now)  
  
K (Relieved): You‚Äôre right, there will be plenty of time to worry about it when we get our boots on the ground. Are you ready to head out now?  
  
(Listener says yes, and they get ready to go)  
  
K (Proud): Then let us be off!  
  
(The Listener and K ride their horses away from the academy, use a pause to indicate that time has passed. The two get a camp set up in the forest, a crackling fire in the background)  
  
K (Tired): I can‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs only been two days. I feel like we‚Äôve been traveling for a lifetime. (Pause) I‚Äôm glad that we decided to set up camp here. Are you going to be able to stay awake for a few hours? I just need to rest my eyes for a while.  
  
(Listener tells K that he can do first watch)  
  
K (Relieved): Excellent, thank you. Well, I‚Äôll try to get to sleep quickly. Wake me if you hear anything suspicious, okay?  
  
(Listener agrees to do so)  
  
K (Drifting off to sleep): Thank you, my friend. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ see you again‚Ä¶ soon.  
  
(Short pause to indicate time has passed)  
  
K (Tired): Hey. Are you still awake?  
  
(Listener confirms)  
  
K: Good. Did the fire go out?  
  
(Listener confirms again)  
  
K: Curses. I‚Äôm not ready to be awake yet.  
  
(Pause as K works up her courage to ask the Listener something)  
  
K: (Deep Breath) Say, do you happen to have any talent with fire magic?  
  
(Listener confirms that he is knowledgeable with flames)  
  
K: Could you‚Ä¶ come and warm me up, then? The rags that the academy gives us to wear under the armor is not nearly as high-quality as the suit itself.  
  
(Listener crouches down by K and starts to warm her with his hands)  
  
K (Embarrassed): You don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ have to sit so far away. Just‚Ä¶ come a little closer. You can‚Ä¶ lie down next to me.  
  
(Listener lies down and settles himself next to K)  
  
K (Flustered): I-I‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶ t-thank you. That‚Äôs m-much better.   
  
(Listener asks why K is flustered)  
  
K (Still flustered): You- I- (Deep Breath) I-I may be a knight, but I am also a‚Ä¶ woman. I have‚Ä¶ needs just as any woman does. And now you‚Äôre lying here, next to me, with your face so close and your warm hands rubbing me to keep me from freezing to death and I‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt help but remember our past together.   
  
K (Serious but still kinda flustered) Do you remember when I tripped and fell in the river? I was so scared because I couldn‚Äôt swim back then. I... still can‚Äôt now, but that‚Äôs besides the point. I was rushing away in the rapids and you jumped right in after me. You knew well that you also couldn‚Äôt swim, but you tried anyway. You paddled and paddled until you grabbed hold of me and managed to drag me to shore, screaming and crying and coughing up saltwater. The water was freezing, so we undressed to our undergarments and clung to each other until we warmed up enough to walk home. (Laughing) I can still see the look on the face of the Grand-master when two half-naked teenagers limped into town. We got yelled at, of course, but I didn‚Äôt mind. I was too caught up in the fact that you tried to save me. I‚Ä¶ never forgot about that. It remains one of my most cherished memories.  
  
(The Listener tells K that he enjoyed it as well)  
  
K (Comfortable): What I‚Äôm trying to say is: you‚Äôre very special to me, and you always have been. There‚Äôs no one that I would rather be heading towards my demise with. (Shudder) I‚Äôm still not entirely thrilled with the idea. Can you‚Ä¶ hold me?  
  
(Listener shuffles to hold K in his arms)  
  
K (Happy): Thank you, you‚Äôre just as comfortable as you were back then. And a lot less wet. (Laughing)   
  
(Pause as K and the Listener hold each other for a bit)  
  
K (Flustered again): So‚Ä¶ did you ever find anyone at the mage academy?  
  
(Listener jokes and says that yes, there were quite a few people at the academy)  
  
K (Even more flustered): You know that I did not mean it that way. I meant‚Ä¶ anyone you were interested in... romantically?  
  
(Listener says that he was too busy for such a thing)  
  
K: (Laughter) Aw, you spent too much time in tomes and cook books to find a nice girl? I guess that makes sense. It must have taken a lot of your time to learn how to cast lighting from your fingertips and‚Ä¶ bake sweet rolls. (Laughing again)  
  
(Listener starts to poke K with his zappy fingers)  
  
K (Shocked (lol)): Ow! (Laughing) Okay, okay, stop it with the lightning fingers! I promise I won‚Äôt make fun of your training anymore.   
  
K (Whispering): But‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre saying you never met anyone, does that mean you‚Äôd be okay if I just‚Ä¶  
  
(K leans in to kiss The Listener, who kisses her back)  
  
K: You know, that was my second kiss. Do you remember what my first one was? (Giggling)  
  
(Listener remembers and tells her)  
  
K (Happy): Aw, I‚Äôm so glad that you remembered! Yes, yes, you kissed me when I told you that I was leaving for the knight academy. And you told me that I could have another when I had graduated. I waited years for that second kiss. I hardly ever looked at another man. All I could do was think about getting back to you. I completed a six-year course in four and a half. I‚Äôm twenty-two years old now, the youngest knight to ever leave the academy with a blue crest, all because I couldn‚Äôt wait to come back to you and get another kiss. So, my handsome mage friend, are you going to stop there? Or are you going to give me more?  
  
(The Listener and K continue to kiss for a while)  
  
K (Aroused): Take off those robes, you won‚Äôt need them. I won‚Äôt let you get cold.   
  
(The Listener disrobes and they continue kissing)  
  
K: Let me get this tunic off, it‚Äôs in the way.  
  
(K disrobes and reveals her breasts)  
  
K: Do you like them? They‚Äôre a bit bigger than when we got out of the river. (Giggling)  
  
(Listener starts to caress her abs)  
  
K: Oh? Do you like my muscles, dear? They are very nice, I worked very hard to maintain them. Knights uphold only the strictest diet and exercise. Do you want to... get closer to them?  
  
(The Listener starts to kiss K‚Äôs abs, trailing down to her pussy)  
  
K: O- oh? What are you doing down there? You‚Äôre not‚Ä¶   
  
(The Listener removes K‚Äôs pants and starts to eat her out)  
  
K (Very Aroused): (Moan) Oh, my! That isn‚Äôt what I had in mind, but I‚Äôm (Moan) certainly not going to stop you.  
  
(Listener stops for a moment)  
  
K (Aggressively Horny): Wait! No! I didn‚Äôt say to stop! Keep going!  
  
(Listener resumes eating her out)  
  
K: (Sharp Inhale) Ah, yes, I had no idea that one could feel such (Moan) pleasure. You don‚Äôt mind if I grab your hair, do you?  
  
(Listener nods while continuing, causing her to moan again, cunnilingus continues)  
  
K (Approaching orgasm): Oh my, I think I‚Äôm going t- Ah! (K orgasms)  
  
K (Deep breaths): I‚Äôve‚Ä¶ never experienced such a thing before. Where on Earth did you learn how to do that?   
  
(Listener explains that he has never done that before)  
  
K (Still panting, Suspicious): There‚Äôs no way you could be that good on your first try, you must have gotten lucky or something!  
  
(Listener teases her, saying it must be easy to make her cum)  
  
K (Flustered, Indignant): I-I am not easy to make‚Ä¶ that happen! You must have picked up a few girls in the academy to learn how to do that!  
  
(Listener says that he never did any such thing)  
  
K (Still flustered): W-well. If you say you‚Äôre not lying, I‚Äôll believe you. Do you‚Ä¶ promise that you‚Äôre also a virgin?  
  
(Listener asks K why that is important)  
  
K (Tsundere mode): It‚Äôs not as if I care! (Whispering) I just wanted our first times to be together‚Ä¶ with eachother.  
  
(Listener promises K that he is also a virgin)  
  
K (Relieved): G-good! I‚Äôm glad! Now come up here. I would like more graduation presents.  
  
(Listener and K continue to kiss and touch one another for a while)  
  
K (Pulling off of a kiss): Now‚Ä¶ I want you to be gentle, okay? I might be a knight, but I don‚Äôt want you to hurt me. Promise that you won‚Äôt be too rough?  
  
(Listener promises and gives her another kiss)  
  
K: Good, now just‚Ä¶ slowly stick it inside of me. Give me a moment to get used to the feeling.   
  
(Listener sticks the head of his cock inside of her)  
  
K (Trying to be quiet): (Moan) That is... quite a strange sensation. Are you all the way in?  
  
(Listener tells her that he is not)  
  
K (Panicking): There‚Äôs more?!? Oh my, uhh, okay. Keep going, slowly.  
  
(Listener slowly pushes further inside of K)  
  
K (Slight pain): Can you kiss me please? It hurts a bit more than I thought it would.  
  
(Listener leans down to kiss K as he pushes the rest of the way inside of her)  
  
K (Aching): Ahh, I‚Äôm sorry. I accidentally bit your lip, are you okay?  
  
(Listener tells her that it was incredibly attractive)  
  
K: You‚Ä¶ liked that? Umm, okay! I can do that again, come back down here! Just keep going slowly, okay?  
  
(K and the Listener kiss and fuck for a while, improvise here for a while)  
  
K: (Moan) You feel exactly as good as I knew you would. You can go a little faster now.   
  
(Continued sex)   
  
K: Oh shit, I mean, umm, poop. I‚Äôm sorry, that wasn‚Äôt very (Moan) knightly of me, was it? (Giggling)  
  
(Listener teases her for swearing)  
  
K: I don‚Äôt think you quite understand, darling. I waited four and a half years to see you, to touch you, to kiss you again. Four and a half years without feeling the touch of a man. I ached every night, thinking about how you would feel inside of me. But now... now I finally have you within reach. I can finally show you everything that I‚Äôve wanted you to do to me for so long. So I‚Äôm sure as hell going to enjoy myself!  
  
(Listener starts to pump faster)  
  
K: That‚Äôs right. Fill me up, handsome. I‚Äôve been craving you for so long, and we‚Äôre all alone. No pesky instructors or Grand-master to scold us for what we‚Äôre doing. So don‚Äôt hold back, I want to feel your love inside of me! Come on, sweetheart, fill me with your seed!  
  
(The Listener and K continue for a while before climaxing at the same time)  
  
(The Listener collapses in exhaustion on top of K)  
  
K (Breathy Whispers): Yes, yes my sweet boy. Sleep now. I can feel your warmth flowing inside of me. You‚Äôre so cute when you‚Äôre tired. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll keep us safe. Sleep well, darling.

6 Of The Most Dangerous Garden Pests,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img qatlnqfzn0j71...*

In nature, there is always a struggle for space and food. In this struggle, there are no winners. A biological equilibrium is established, where a beneficial fauna suppresses the reproduction rate of pests. And this pest, usually a polyphagous representative of the animal kingdom, can destroy large [**vegetable**](https://www.thumbgarden.com/how-to-plant/vegetables/), grain, and fruit crops in a single day. On arable land, the real owners of gardens and orchards [**control this pest**](https://www.thumbgarden.com/garden-care/garden-pests/) by their own methods. Here we present to you [**six of the most dangerous garden pests**](https://www.thumbgarden.com/dangerous-garden-pests/) and how to deal with them.

&amp;#x200B;

**I. THE SPIDER MITE IS A COSMOPOLITAN AND OMNIVOROUS PEST**

Among these Acari, the most common and best known is the Spider mite (Tetranychidae). Out of about 50,000 species, more than 1250 species occur worldwide, including Antarctica. Spider mites are tiny spider-like creatures. Males are 0.3-0.6 mm, and females up to 1.0 mm.

The body of Spider mite is round and covered with tiny bristles and sometimes tiny warts. The head has 2 pairs of eyes, and the mouthparts have suction. The legs have five parts. The color of the Spider mite body is variable, depending on the color of the main host. In most cases, Spider mite has red, green, brown, yellow-green, and dirty green colors.

&amp;#x200B;

By puncturing the tissue, Spider mite sucks out the cell contents.

&amp;#x200B;

A. Degree of the danger of Spider mite

Acari can destroy a plant in 3 days by acquiring it. The voraciousness of Spider mites, combined with their rapid reproduction (7 days from larva to adult), under optimal environmental conditions, causes epiphytic infestations on the leaves of green plants that never recover and must be destroyed.

To protect themselves from the environment, Spider mite weave their habitat (not all species) with fine spider webs. They live in groups under leaves and clods of soil. Eggs remain viable for up to five years.

&amp;#x200B;

B. Which crops are infested by Spider mites?

All Spider mite species are dangerous pests of garden and park crops. The pests colonize all plants, including flowering plants and houseplants. They are particularly attracted to all fruit trees, strawberries, beans, onions, jasmine, and roses. Flowering plants include begonias, gladioli, tulips, hyacinths, orchids, and others.

&amp;#x200B;

External manifestations of C. spider mite infestation

Yellow spots, small holes, silvery spots (cobwebs), discoloration, and leaf deformation (in bright light) can be seen on the leaves of infested plants. Spider mite infestation on plants is usually epiphytic.

&amp;#x200B;

C. Control measures

Preventive, chemical, biological.

Systematic plant inspections are necessary to be able to save infected plants, especially indoor and outdoor plants. If a Spider mite infestation is suspected, treat plants (especially flowering crops) with insecticides or biological agents.

In cases where garden crops are heavily infested with Spider mite (30-35 days before harvest), naturally derived acaricides such as neem oil, pyrethrins, azadirachtin, and horticultural oils can be sprayed directly on adult mites, larvae, Rufus, and eggs to kill them at first touch. Spray on active spider mite infestations every 3 days until control is achieved.

&amp;#x200B;

**II. APHID IS A CARRIER OF VIRAL PLANT DISEASES**

Aphid (Aphidoidea) is one of the most common pests of green plants. Aphid is winged and wingless and has different functions in insect life. The body length of an aphid varies from 0.3-0.8 mm, while some species of aphid have a body length of 2-5 mm. aphid is oblong, ovoid, ellipsoidal, and hemispherical. The color of aphid varies from light green Aphid coloration varies from light green to green, yellow-green and black.

The body of Aphid is covered with hairs, tubercles, villi, and epiphytes. The small trapezoidal head is adorned with 2 red, brown, or black multifaceted black eyes. The forehead of the Aphid has long tentacles, which are organs of touch and hearing. The mouthparts are represented by distinctive proboscis that pierces the surface of leaves or shoots to suck plant sap. Aphid's long, slender legs allow them to move by walking and jumping.

&amp;#x200B;

A. The danger level of Aphid

Despite their small size, aphids are vicious pests. Each female gives birth to 17 generations in the summer, giving birth to 100-300 new Aphids every 2 weeks. In the fall, Aphids sprout wings and repopulate new areas. They number about 4000 species in the taxonomy and are almost always carriers of viral plant diseases, over which the plant community currently has little control.

&amp;#x200B;

B. Which crops are affected by Aphid?

Aphid occurs in all vegetable and fruit crops as well as in flower beds. Weak or overfed plants that are susceptible to Aphid stings to produce nourishing sap are most often harmed.

&amp;#x200B;

C. Outward signs of Aphid infestation

The first sign of Aphid is the presence of ants on the plant. Ants disperse Aphid and feed on the sweet sap they secrete. On damaged plants, the young leaves at the end of stems and shoots curl. Over time, the well-developed older leaves become covered with a sticky coating that becomes a breeding ground for fungal and viral diseases. The leaves of some plants are deformed and form galls of various colors in which pests reside.

&amp;#x200B;

D. Methods of controlling Aphid

As with other pests, Aphid control methods are divided into agricultural, chemical, biological, and folk methods.

Using chemical methods to protect plants from aphids on small areas of private property is undesirable and hazardous to your health.

It is recommended to use biological agents that are not harmful to human and animal health. Insecticides (complexes of natural avermectins) and other biological agents. Aphid is completely eradicated within 1 to 3 days.

Neem oil, insecticidal soaps, and horticultural oils are effective against aphids.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**III. MOLE CRICKET**

&amp;#x200B;

[Mole Cricket Is A Member Of The Insect Family Gryllotalpidae](https://preview.redd.it/ko58zyafo0j71.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c05990d96d3f65e60f335b754e32f4dc140b9d9)

Mole cricket is a member of the insect family Gryllotalpidae. Mole cricket is a large adult, 2-3inch (5-8cm) long, reddish-brown in color. The head of Mole cricket has a pair of large eyes and gnawing mouthparts.

The back has twisted wings in the form of flagella. They are used only in warm weather. The abdomen is tan and lighter in color than the back. Adults are capable of digging underground passages, crawling, flying, and swimming.

&amp;#x200B;

A. What crops are harmed by Mole cricket?

Mole cricket is one of the most dangerous pests, comparable to Grasshoppers and Colorado potato beetles in terms of damage to crops. A single adult can destroy up to 10-20 plants in a single day.

Adult and larval beetles feed on stems at the soil level and roots at the top of grains and vegetables, including eggplant, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, cabbage, carrots, ornamental flowers, and shrubs. Adult Mole cricket preys on small insects, worms, and beetle larvae that live in the soil. At the same time, Mole cricket is known as ""gourmets."" They do not actually use weeds as food, only edible plants.

&amp;#x200B;

B. Signs of Mole cricket destroying plants

Seedlings at the base of the stem are crushed, or shoots are bitten. The plant wilts within a few hours, start to dry out, and then dies. Plants damaged by adult Mole cricket and its larvae cannot be repaired and must be replanted with new plants.

On solid crops, gaps appear in the fields where one can find the nests of Mole cricket eggs in the middle. After rainfall, typical horizontal pathways made by adults can be observed around the plants and between the rows. The pathways usually lead to burrows with entrance holes varying in width from 0.6-0.8inch (1.5-2 cm).

&amp;#x200B;

C. Control measures for adults and larvae

C1. Agricultural techniques

All measures leading to the destruction of honey bee nests: deep plowing, systematic weed control, constant loosening of the soil - up to 6inch (15 cm) deep, trapping pits made of manure in autumn and spring, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

C2. Chemical techniques

Soap solution is one of the simplest and easiest methods of control. Once you see the entrance to the mole crickets' underground residence, prepare a soap solution and apply it directly to the hole with a stream. 1-2 liters of water will drive the insects out of the burrow. Then your job is to capture and eliminate it.

While sowing or planting crops, you can use Medvetox granular insecticide.' Medvetox' contains 50 grams of diazinon per 2.2 Lb (1 kg). The remaining ingredients are fillers, flavoring agents, and flavoring agents to attract pests.

It is an enteric and contact pesticide that can be used in agriculture and private home sites. The pellets do not become wet and do not dissolve in the soil. The bait is effective for 3 weeks from the date of insertion into the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

C3. Biotechnology

Liquid and granular formulations of insecticides are commonly used in the soil to suppress Mole cricket. In some cases, irrigation should follow the insecticide application because the insecticide must enter the plant's root zone to be most effective, but this is an insecticide-specific requirement, so the insecticide label should be read carefully for application instructions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**IV. TURNIP MOTH**

Turnip moth (Agrotis segetum) is a particularly dangerous pest. Its inconspicuous appearance and modest size are deceptive. The body length is no more than 1-2inch (2.5-5cm). Turnip moth wings are monochromatic gray or yellowish-brown with individual spots and horizontal dark and light stripes. Female and male Turnip moths are dimorphic: females have grayish-brown hindwings, while males have white hindwings. Turnip moths are active at dusk and feed primarily at night.

&amp;#x200B;

A. Risk class of white-backed Turnip moth in winter

Under optimal environmental conditions, a female moth lays 600 to 2240 eggs, producing 95-98% of the caterpillars. Young moths emerge from the pupa 20-25 minutes after hatching and are ready to fly and feed.

&amp;#x200B;

B. Types of crops affected

Caterpillars of the Turnip moth damage more than 140 plant species in 36 families in winter. They are divided into leaf-feeding, intra-stem, and sub-stem and damage the root system of plants. Typically, the Turnip moth damages 10-20 sugar beetroots in a single day.

Turnip moth destroys roots of corn, tobacco, millet, and cotton. In summer, it attacks vegetable and technical crops, including squash, zucchini, peas, and potatoes; in fall, it invades winter and winter crops. Among weeds, the Turnip moth prefers to settle and feed on the roots of plantain, thistle, and creeper.

&amp;#x200B;

C. Signs of Turnip moth damage

Turnip moth caterpillars damage stems at the soil level and actually eat the bases of seedlings, potato tubers, and root crops, leaving characteristic cavities in which they sometimes settle. Turnip moth eats the soft parts of the leaves, leaving only the veins. You should be aware of the widespread wilting of plants over a large area in a single day.

&amp;#x200B;

D. Control measures for Turnip moth in winter

D1. Agricultural techniques

1. Deep plowing and spring harrowing.

2. Observe the return conditions of crop rotation.

3. Complete elimination of weeds and systematic inter-row tillage of row crops.

&amp;#x200B;

D2. Chemical technology

The chemical control measures for Turnip moth, effective use of preparations Decis, Fas, Zeta-cypermethrin, etc. The chemical agents should be used at home with great care and strictly according to the time and dosage in the instructions.

&amp;#x200B;

D3. Biotechnology

Biological agents, such as Bitoxybacillin, should be used at home.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**V. MELOLONTHA IS A DUAL PEST**

&amp;#x200B;

[Melolontha Is A Large Polyphagous Pest](https://preview.redd.it/hjndc9zdo0j71.jpg?width=650&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=791fd3e1ba72b99ebb2d7d76ce3cf7d0a2df88de)

Melolontha is a large polyphagous pest. Adult insects reach a body length of 1.4-1.6inch (3.5-4 cm.) The body of Melolontha is light brown or tan. Flight and reproduction of Melolontha begin around the second decade of May. 1-1.5 months later, large white larvae with blackheads and mouthparts hatch from the eggs. Their white segmented bodies are coiled into the shape of an embryo.

Melolontha larvae live and feed in the soil for 3-4 years. By late summer of the fourth year, adult beetles emerge from their pupae and remain in the soil until spring. In spring, adult beetles begin to feed heavily on the ground. During this period, Melolontha is the most dangerous pest because the larvae in the soil damage the root system, and the surface beetles damage the flowers and vegetation.

&amp;#x200B;

A. Dangerousness of Melolontha

Melolontha populations increase significantly and rapidly under favorable conditions. The damage threshold for Melolontha is 1 larva per 11 square feet of area. Currently, there are 2-3 in some areas and more than 20 larvae per 11 square feet near forest strips. Thus, the threshold of harmfulness is repeatedly exceeded, i.e., it is possible to talk about the epiphytic reproduction of Melolontha.

&amp;#x200B;

B. Which crops are affected by Melolontha and its larvae?

Melolontha is one of the most dangerous pests. Both adults and larvae can damage plants. Adult Melolontha feeds on the leaves, flowers, and ovaries of all fruit and ornamental trees and shrubs during the flight and breeding seasons (about 1-2 months per year, mainly in spring).

Melolontha larvae gnaw on the roots of strawberries/strawberries, black and other currants, cherries, pears, apples (which they particularly like), poplars, birches, cedars, spruces, and other plants. In addition, the larvae of this pest become more and more voracious as they get older. Currently, there is a 10-year intensive breeding campaign of Melolontha and its migration to new locations. It is now necessary to take all measures to protect the plants and eradicate the pest.

&amp;#x200B;

C. Signs of Melolontha infestation

Plants infested with Melolontha destroy the leaves, flower buds, ovaries, and young needles of conifers. If the roots are damaged by the larvae, the plants lag in development, wilt, and are easily pulled out of the soil.

&amp;#x200B;

D. Methods of controlling Melolontha

D1. Agricultural techniques

Melolontha and its larvae cannot tolerate the odor and excrement of lupine and the nitrogen compounds in the soil. The number of Melolontha larvae per unit area can be reduced by sowing white clover, peas, and other nitrogen-fixing crops or by sowing mustard and cruciferous grass seedlings under yard pens.

During mass flights (late April through May), shake branches and collect Melolontha in the morning at temperatures no higher than 53-59¬∞F (12-15¬∞C).

The soil is covered with a fine ground cover in the form of shavings, crushed bark, chopped straw, chopped elder branches, chopped lupine pieces, various cruciferous plants up to cabbage leaves.

&amp;#x200B;

D2. Chemical techniques

The following chemical preparations specifically targeting Melolontha larvae are recommended.

Zemlin, Actara et al - contact entericidal insecticide. Ammonia solution can be used as a harmless chemical agent to kill the larvae of Melolontha.

&amp;#x200B;

D3. Biotechnology

Nemabakt was developed based on soil nematodes. The biological product maintains a positive pest balance in the soil for more than 2 years. Kills pests within 3 days.

Biological agent Boverin etc., effectively kills larvae of Melolontha.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**VI. GRASSHOPPERS - THE HUNGRY MESSENGERS**

Asian Grasshoppers or Migratory Grasshoppers (Locusta migratoria). Every inhabitant associated with the green plant and animal world has seen Grasshoppers. Do you remember the story of the ""green mare""? It is one of the 2 life forms of Grasshoppers, the solitary one.

Grasshoppers are large insects, 1-2inch (2.5-5 cm) long, similar to grasshoppers. They are characterized by a curved, sharp keel on the prothorax and a strong chin. The forewings of Grasshoppers have densely speckled with tan, and the hindwings are delicate and translucent, with a yellowish or sometimes greenish tinge. Depending on nutritional and environmental conditions, adult Grasshoppers may live solitary (green females) or gregarious (brown individuals) lives. In the solitary stage, Grasshoppers hardly cause any damage to the plant.

&amp;#x200B;

A. What are the dangers of Grasshoppers?

Grasshoppers are omnivorous pests whose feeding activity is concentrated in the early morning and late afternoon when there are no thermal peaks. During the swarming stage of Grasshoppers' life, they form huge adult swarms (hopper swarms) consisting of groups of larvae. A swarm of Grasshoppers can eat 200-500 g of plants with different densities of plants and reproductive organs (leaves, flowers, shoots, stems, and fruits).

Grasshoppers devour everything on their way. A single group of Grasshoppers can occupy from 2 to 20 or even more thousands of hectares at a time, flying 186 miles (300 km) per day while feeding, and 621miles (1000 km) per day in the presence of a tailwind, leaving the bare ground and detached remains of woody shoots and plant stems in its wake.

Grasshoppers may survive in groups for several years, gradually fading and returning to a solitary life. The average interval between epiphytes is 10-12 years.

&amp;#x200B;

B. Grasshoppers control measures

B1. Agricultural techniques

&amp;#x200B;

1. In areas prone to Grasshoppers, it is necessary to replant gardens or home plots in late fall.

2. Deep harrowing in spring and early fall digging is recommended to promote damage to the nests (egg pods) of the pests.

3. It is necessary to till unused areas, which will prevent the deposition of Grasshoppers' eggs by ants.

&amp;#x200B;

B2. Chemical techniques

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bait

Bait is a mixture of an attractive food source (such as wheat bran) and an insecticide. Common baits contain spores of methomyl (a carbamate insecticide) or locusts (a natural locust pathogen). Bait should be evenly distributed throughout the habitat and must be reapplied weekly and immediately after rain or irrigation. The baits are selective because they kill only grasshoppers and other foraging insects (N. locustae kills only grasshoppers).

&amp;#x200B;

2. Dust

The dust has a short residual and must be reapplied weekly and after rain or irrigation. Both baits and powders are easy to use but moderately expensive. A number of insecticide sprays are available to combat grasshoppers, including malathion, methomyl, permethrin, and bifenthrin. The insect growth regulator diflubenzuron (Dimilin) is available for commercial-scale applications.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Sprays

Sprays are cheaper than baits and dust but require a sprayer appropriate for the scale of application. Sprays will kill on contact or when grasshoppers eat treated foliage. Check all product labels for permitted application sites. For example, some insecticides can be used on ornamentals but not on edible plants.

[Futa4F/Futa] GHRV: The Trainer,"*The first documented case of Gender Hybridization Retrovirus occurred in 1945, right after the end of WWII. A 27-year-old American GI named Francis Caldwell suddenly got flu-like symptoms while convalescing in an Army hospital from a gunshot wound in the leg. Doctors looked on in absolute shock as the man before them steadily changed, over the course of three days, from a six-foot tall reasonably fit man to an incredibly curvaceous woman with looks that pin-up models would be jealous of, save for one difference: ‚Äòshe‚Äô was a fully-functional hermaphrodite.*

*Slowly, around the world, more and more cases of this transformative condition began to appear. Scientists were baffled as to what the cause was, where it came from, how it worked, and at a complete loss as to how to stop it. Over time, experimentation proved it was not communicable in any way, shape or form, nor was it found to exist outside the human body. Only a simple test developed years later could confirm its presence in the blood when symptoms began to appear.*

*Later, as understanding of DNA and heritable traits grew and genetic testing became viable, they better understood the mechanisms for change. Essentially, the virus caused the body to reboot into a physically perfected hermaphroditic state based on the traits the individual had from both parents. Anyone over the age of twenty was returned to that, free of any imperfections they had. Eyesight problems? Clarified. Fillings in your teeth? Pushed out. Blind? Deaf? Mute? Crippled? All fixed.*

*The new hermaphrodites (or futas as they came to be called, based on the Japanese term futanari) possessed all the sex drive of a man and a woman in a single body. Besides near-perfect body symmetry, skin clarity, hair, teeth and fitness, they tended towards the large size of breast and penis dimensions, roughly twice the average person‚Äôs. Their internalized testicles also produced far more sperm and their wombs were highly fertile, making multiple children a likely result of impregnation. This was further compounded by the fact a futa was highly likely to have a futa child, and two futas together guaranteed that result.*

*Acceptance of their existence was slow, and even as they began to propagate, they still remained very much a minority in the world. World religions gave them tentative acceptance, laws guaranteeing their basic rights were passed but a lot of fear and prejudice surrounded them. Oversexed nymphos, deviants and perverts, Godless abominations, all things futas were called. Some claimed they were part of a secret Nazi program to create the Ubermensch, others said it was alien interference or a plague sent by God to mark the sinful and curry the sinners together. Still others called them the next stage in human evolution, even that they were the Nephilim, children of the Angels returned to lead humanity into a Golden Age.*

*The year is now 2020. Francine (as she came to be known) Caldwell recently passed away, the first of roughly 10% of the world‚Äôs makeup, the futanari. In those 75 years, futas have won the right to marry, adopt children, have their own bathrooms and locker rooms alongside transgender people. Hospitals now understand how to help ease the transformation with a regimen of painkillers and intravenous nutritional supplements. Clothing manufacturers produce ‚ÄòFuta-Fit‚Äô wear in women‚Äôs styles. Even so, many still face discrimination as hate groups and conspiracy nuts perpetuate old stereotypes and prejudices about them, as such people always do. They fearmonger, call GHRV the ‚ÄòFuta Flu‚Äô and keep the myth it‚Äôs contagious alive, use hate speech like ‚Äòherm‚Äô or ‚Äòdickgirl‚Äô, ‚Äòshemale‚Äô and ‚Äòworm‚Äô. But there are others who support them, uplift them as they do many such marginalized groups. And so, our story begins‚Ä¶*

---

The sun shone down from the early morning sky, still tinged pink and gold, as a late-model green Volvo subcompact pulled into the tiny lot of the old brickface building. The sign over the door said 'Redhill Boxing &amp; Fitness Center', clearly newer than the rest of the inner-city structure was. The door of the car opened and out slipped the driver, Redhill's owner: Ramona 'Mona' Sylvestri.

Like most futas, she was arrestingly attractive, around five and a half feet tall with a compact musculature, olive complexion and facial features suggesting her Italian heritage, steely blue eyes and dark hair buzzed close on the sides and back of her head, while the top was simply cut short save for a pair of swept bangs that framed her lovely face, each dyed a dark purple hue.

As futas went, she was surprisingly small-chested, only rounding out at a C, but her body was chiseled perfection. She lacked the heavier bulk of a powerlifter, but her tone was amazing and anyone who doubted her strength was free to hop into the ring with her and find out just how well she could apply power to a point with her quick, practiced fists.

At one time, she'd aspired to be a pro boxer, but before she could actually begin her career, she'd contracted GHRV and that had shut it down. Futas were not allowed in pro sports, and there was still not enough impetus in society to allow them their own divisions, despite numerous amateur leagues in a number of sports. Mona had boxed in those for charity, and it had given her a good relationship with the Caldwell Foundation.

That relationship had come in handy when, after finishing school and getting her degree in sports medicine and fitness training, she'd taken over the aging boxing gym left to her by her late grandfather - former Welterweight contender Santino 'Sonny Silver' Silvestri - and brought it into the 21st Century as a place for overall health, not just learning that sweet science of fisticuffs.

Now, as the old neighborhood was undergoing gentrification (love it or hate it, personally Mona liked regular income and the meals and other amenities it allowed) business was doing well, and the Foundation's endorsement brought in other futas looking for an environment that would include them and make them feel safe and welcome, as many traditional gyms were spotty about doing despite claims to the contrary.

Disarming the security system, she went inside and started getting things ready to open, stripping off her sweatsuit outerwear for the tanktop and bike shorts she usually favored on the job. They left no illusions as to her gender with the sizable dent in the front, but anyone put off by that was welcome to leave. She would not be made to feel ashamed for what she was. Life was too short, losing grampa had driven that home.

Once everything was ready, Mona unlocked the doors for the start of their business day. Outside the city was waking up for the day shift and getting into gear, and she paused to look at herself in the bank of mirrors along one wall, get in her stance and throw a fast combination before giving a pixie-cute grin and turning her attention towards the sound of the first arrivals. *Today's going to be another great day...*

Hello, and welcome to my latest RP prompt! This time we return to my GHRV story universe with a new character, Mona Silvestri, a Changed futa who owns and operates a gym. As you might guess, the story for this one will probably involve it in some aspect for bringing your character and mine together, the exact relationship of which is up for discussion.

Are you a new customer? Someone from the neighborhood who Changed and is looking to reconnect? An aspiring boxer yourself looking for a place to train? Or perhaps someone who saw Mona fight or found her on social media and is hoping to try and hook up? Lots of possibilities, and I hope to hear your ideas on that as well as about your character when you contact me to play.

Kinks-wise [I have a few](https://www.f-list.net/c/leni%20travis) but I'm more interested in a good blend of story and smut with sexytimes being more about a switchy exchange of top and bottom action as is only natural for a futa (which to remind, futas have a penis and vagina both), especially if your character is *also* futa like Mona is. We can discuss if you have specifics you would/would not like to include. So, the standard reminders:


- NO Male characters or anything not explicitly Female or Futa as outlined above.

- NO Reddit Chat, or outside platforms.

- NO one-liners or low-effort 'hi im intrsted' responses. Proper use of spelling, grammar and punctuation is a requirement, along with detailed responses. Additionally, third-person writing style is **vastly** preferred, I will be using it as seen above.

[And now a link to my other RP prompts in case you're curious!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RamManagerSnafu/)

Take care, and thanks for reading!

3 months out. My breakup story.,"Hello. I wanted to make a post about where I‚Äôm at after 3 months and share resources I found helpful. I found reading other people‚Äôs accounts to be really helpful to understanding my own feelings and wanted to provide my own. That said, everyone goes through their own process in their own time and that‚Äôs okay.

We were both in our first long term relationship. It lasted 7.5 months. She ended it quite suddenly, saying she had never properly thought about having kids and being in a committed relationship, and she realised she wants neither. We had discussed both these things early on and the ending felt very sudden. No idea if that is the real reason she ended it, but I‚Äôm not going to stew on it.

First month was super tough. I cried more each day than I‚Äôve cried in my life. I didn‚Äôt know my vocal chords could make those noises. I cried on the way to work. I cried during lunch. I cried in the toilets at work between tasks. I cried on the way home. I cried in my bed. I woke up and cried. Went to sleep crying.

I had to take time off work. I had physical pain in my chest and couldn‚Äôt focus. I chose to tell my team at work as soon as it happened and that helped them give me space and to understand why I wasn‚Äôt functioning properly when I returned. (This won‚Äôt work for everyone and will depend on the workplace). 

I can‚Äôt eat when I‚Äôm sad or stressed and I lost a lot of weight. I bought foods I really like to get some calories in my stomach. But it took a few weeks to find motivation to get out of bed and cook food and to have an appetite to eat it.

I put away any gifts or reminders of her that I had. She bought me a lovely diffuser and I found a school library to donate it to. I then bought myself a different model to replace it. I had a book she gave me that I wanted a copy of, but it had a note from her in the front. I bought a new copy for myself. $30 for peace of mind was worth it.

At first I didn‚Äôt think the breakup was final and we kept talking for a few days. After I realised it was, we went No Contact right away. I can‚Äôt describe how painful and hard this was. I fought myself constantly for weeks not to message her. I was really lucky to have friends I could message/contact anytime I felt the urge. I did every trick in the book. I would take a shower whenever I felt the urge. I would leave my phone and walk around the block. In group settings, I gave my phone to other people. But ultimately, it was ridiculously hard to do and a constant battle for the first few weeks. We also split up our mutual hobbies to make sure we didn‚Äôt see each other. 

I don‚Äôt know how I would have got through this month without a few extremely supportive friends I could talk to. I also called lots of my old friends and asked them for advice about breakup and to tell me their stories. This was incredibly helpful. It gave me perspective on my own breakup, advice about what to do, and reminded me that I had good supportive people in my life. It also kept me occupied for the first few extremely painful days. (If you don‚Äôt have friends you can talk to, see if you can find a therapist).

By month two, I still missed her a lot, but it started coming in waves. I would feel happy and think I was doing well, then get in my car to go somewhere and burst into tears. Other times, I could function but felt overall sad and like I had to force myself to focus at work. I was glad work was something stable in my life that gave me something to do as time passed. Some days, work was really tough and I just wanted to go home early.

Eventually, after 6-8 weeks, she messaged me to ‚Äòcheck in‚Äô. By that point I realised I couldn‚Äôt just be friends and my feelings for her were way too strong. I told her that and we stopped messaging. By month 3, I blocked her. I realised that any messages from her would only hinder my healing. If she really wanted to contact me or to get back together, she could easily find a way through mutual friends.

I signed up for fun things I wanted to do every night of the week and this was really helpful. It gave me something to look forward to every day, and left me without time to wallow. This was only possible after a few weeks had gone by. The first month or so I had no motivation, couldn't get out of bed other than for work, and needed to spend the time grieving.

Two weeks ago we went into lockdown and it hit me really hard. I was alone without much of my support group and activities. It‚Äôs taken time, but I‚Äôm slowly adjusting to this and finding other hobbies I can do instead and creative ways to spend my time. I‚Äôm also making sure to stay in touch with friends digitally. It‚Äôs not the same, but it‚Äôs something.

I still cry but it lasts shorter and is more intermittent. The waves come less often and for shorter duration. But when I do feel sad, it feels like it will last forever and won‚Äôt go away. And then it does. And then it comes back. And then it goes away again. This is called ‚Äòrecycling‚Äô and is normal.

Some people talk about experiencing five stages of grief. I go in and out of all five. One thing I found useful was that some refer to the bargaining stage as a ‚Äòlonging‚Äô phase. I spent so much time just missing her. I would scan the streets for her and pause anytime I saw someone that looked similar. It‚Äôs taken a while, but slowly this is going down. I have found journaling every day to be helpful. It helps me get feelings out, and it also allows me to look back and see how I have felt over time.

A nice thing I read on reddit is that if there is a basis for friendship it will still be there in a few months or years. For now, focus on yourself and healing.

## Resources

Everyone likes getting their information in different ways. 

Whatever your preferred medium, there are resources that can help you. 

If you do an internet search for things like ‚Äòhow do I get over a breakup‚Äô, you will see people trying to make money by telling you how to get your ex back. Stay as far away from these sites as you possibly can. They don‚Äôt work and don‚Äôt help you heal. Generally, I didn‚Äôt have luck from internet searches. But I found other resources to be invaluable.

My favourite way of getting information from is books, and I read breakup books that have helped me immensely. I recommend the following:

* How to Fix a Broken Heart by Guy Winch
* Conscious Uncoupling: 5 Steps to Living Happily Even After by Thomas Katherine Woodward
* Getting Past Your Breakup by Susan Elliot J

Each of these helped me in different ways and had different pieces of advice I took from them. 

I also cannot recommend enough the following two books. While not specifically about breakups, they helped me tremendously:

* The Wild Edge of Sorrow by Francis Weller
* How to be Single and Happy: Science-Based Strategies for Keeping Your Sanity While Looking for a Soul Mate by Jenny Taitz

There were some internet resources that also really helped me:

* This list of reasons for no contact: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/wiki/reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/wiki/reasons)   
I saved this as a bookmark and every time I felt the urge to contact, I forced myself to read this list first. I read this a few times every day at first.
* I also really liked the resources on the website magnetofsuccess.com   
One thing that helped me was understanding the difference between dumper and dumpee timelines:
   * Dumpee timeline: [https://magnetofsuccess.com/stages-of-break-up-dumpee/](https://magnetofsuccess.com/stages-of-break-up-dumpee/)
   * Dumper timeline: [https://magnetofsuccess.com/stages-of-break-up-dumper/](https://magnetofsuccess.com/stages-of-break-up-dumper/)
* This really helped me understand why I shouldn‚Äôt message my ex early on and how it was possible that she had jumped back into dating so soon. It made me realise that she will miss me, it just won‚Äôt happen immediately.

I also spent a lot of time on /r/breakups, /r/exnocontact and /r/heartbreak

I‚Äôm not huge into videos, but if you like getting your information from videos, I recommend the following:

* Sexplanations breakup first aid: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS1\_K8JcZT0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS1_K8JcZT0) 
* How To Get Over A Break Up | Coping Strategies from an Integrative Psychiatrist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nQxmj9DfP0
* Franics Weller interview on grief: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jw4fNjvGBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jw4fNjvGBQ)
* TED talk on rejection - Overcoming Rejection, When People Hurt You &amp; Life Isn't Fair [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yBfAeadqjI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yBfAeadqjI) 
* Guy Winch Ted Talk - How to fix a broken heart: [https://www.ted.com/talks/guy\_winch\_how\_to\_fix\_a\_broken\_heart](https://www.ted.com/talks/guy_winch_how_to_fix_a_broken_heart) 

I also recommend trying breakup podcasts. There are many out there. Personally, I liked this one: [https://open.spotify.com/show/5YrQuwaMcwG1OZ3HJB0DZp](https://open.spotify.com/show/5YrQuwaMcwG1OZ3HJB0DZp) 

Lastly, if music is your thing, find songs that speak to you. There's no shortage of breakup songs out there and it can help you process and feel your emotions.

This post isn‚Äôt about how to find healing - you can find that in the above resources. I just wanted to share my story and encourage you to check out the resources that can help you.",BreakUps,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/p9q6f9/3_months_out_my_breakup_story/,,unchartered12,p9q6f9,/r/BreakUps/comments/p9q6f9/3_months_out_my_breakup_story/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/p9q6f9/3_months_out_my_breakup_story/,0,2021-08-23
"36[M4F][NY][internet] Experienced Dom/Daddy looking for a sweetly submissive lady to enjoy some specific scenes, kinks, and lovely chats. There's also a nice bonus if you make it to the end of the post!","Hi, thanks for stopping by my post! It's so great you stopped by because this could be an incredible opportunity for you.

Now what is that opportunity? It's the opportunity to be my friend and play mate! 

But you're wondering why you'd want to do that, well I'll tell you about me then.

As you can tell from the title I'm a 36 year old straight Dom/Daddy. That's just the beginning though.

I've been involved in BDSM since I was 19 when I was introduced to it by an older woman I was dating at the time. I even tried being a sub for a few months when I was 23. I learned I wasn't a switch but it gave me a great lesson on what it means to be a better Dom. 

Over the years my kink interests have really grown and they're pretty all over the place. [I even have one of those standard kink charts so you can easily see almost of all of them!](https://i.imgur.com/LnwYPxR.png) I always stick to the Dominant end of things, but I've become pretty flexible in my roles. I can be the caring disciplinarian Daddy, the stern Dom, the utterly sadistic Master, or something in between that blends those to fit what works for you. When it comes to online play I really enjoy orgasm control, [masturbation instructions](https://soundgasm.net/u/mister_andre85/Instructions), tasks, punishments, voyeurism, and all sorts of simply kinky fun you can do at home under my control.

Today though I'm looking for some pretty specific things for some specific things and here's a list:

1. The most obvious and easiest would be going along with my reddit name. It's a classic that never goes out of style that I always love seeing in that little orange envelope!

2. I've got a major voyeurism fetish that I haven't been able to engage in a while and I'd love to spy on one of you lovely ladies. But spying on you doing what is your obvious next question and it's got a pretty simple answer. Showering, getting ready to go out, dressing up, trying things on, working out, playing with yourself, and pretty much anything else that involves you being naked. Hell, I could just watch you trying on swimsuits and I'd be happy for days.

3. Some simple D/s or DD/lg based fun where I instruct you on how to touch yourself and get off while I watch on Skype. [Something like this, but I know all ladies don't like the Daddy thing so that can be changed.](https://soundgasm.net/u/mister_andre85/Instructions-For-Naughty-Girls)

4. Finally, just having someone kinky and fun to chat with tonight would be really nice too.

Now besides my kinks there's all sorts of interesting cool things to know about me. I worked at the same company since college and worked my way up to middle management before quitting so I could start a whole new career. I volunteer at the local film forum and I love that. I'm also a huge film nerd in general. From high brow Oscar nominees to the madness that was straight to video I love it all in some way. I can talk about movies for hours, so be prepared for that. In the summer I do my to go hiking every weekend as a way to just get away from it all for at least a few hours. During the winter months I'll end up shoveling sidewalks for some old people on my block to keep busy. Plus some of those old ladies will throw me some awesome baked goods and who can say no to that?

Oh wow, I just looked my post over and it's pretty long already. So I think I'll end it here and invite you to light up my orange envelope if you're interested in what I'm offering.

"[M4F] Not Single, Still BLACKED","Welcome to choose your own BLACKEDventure. If you are feeling like a naughty role play today follow these instructions. Pick one of the following prompts, and then send a message describing yourself physically, what type of personality you have, and also describe your husband/boyfriend and your relationship. 

1. (Un)welcome intruder: You and your husband/boyfriend are in a long distance relationship. You both make time to FaceTime every night. However on this particular night you happened to be coming home from a bar where you met a nice tall handsome and muscular black man. Feeling particularly frisky after the encounter you decide to seduce your man into some FaceTime sex. However things get interesting when the guy from the bar shows up. Did you invite him back to pretend rape you and cuck your husband/boyfriend? Or did he just follow you and take matters into his own hands, and you were surprised how much you loved it. Either way all your man can do is watch... 

2. Spring Break Cuck: You and your boyfriend have planned a European vacation over spring break to celebrate your last semester in college together. When he cancels on you to do a stupid internship, you are livid. You decide to go with your sorority sisters to Cancun for spring break instead, and you swear NOTHING is going to stop you from having fun on this trip. What you forget though is that you left your computer at your boyfriends house and when you forget your confirmation number for your flight you ask him to go on to your computer and get it. What he also realizes? That he can see every one of your messages, pictures, snaps chats, videos, group chats, insta dms...everything. 

3. Training or getting Trained? You are an athletic trainer for your schools football team and they are short handed on staff. They need you to fill in and help administer the players drug tests. No big deal right? You just have to watch every player as they drop their pants and take their test right in front of you. 

4. Nurse knows best: Your new patient has the biggest dick you‚Äôve ever seen. Now it‚Äôs causing problems for you as you have to spend all day at work with it all this week, but when you go home, only your husbands/boyfriends much much smaller dick is waiting for you. 

5. Roommates: You accidentally catch a glimpse of your boyfriends roommates dick, and it‚Äôs the biggest thing you‚Äôve ever seen. You run out and try to forget about it, but from then on you swear you can see it through any pants he is wearing. It‚Äôs all you can think about. 

6. Bachelorette party: You are the bride to be and your girls are going to make sure tonight (or this weekend) is all about you! Whether it be a trip to Vegas, or just a night out, black strippers are definitely in your future. 

7. You go on a mission trip to a small African village. While you are there, it is your job to teach the boys in the village English. Little did you know what a BIG surprise was in store for you. 

8. Jamaican vacation: Your husband treats you to an all expense vacation at to an ultra exclusive and ultra upscale resort on the beaches of Jamaica. Truly the best the island has to offer. While you are there you both can‚Äôt help but notice that all of the staff are tall muscular handsome black men. You both also notice that a number of the white women at the resort are wearing these stunning gold bikinis. Noticing how fabulous they are, you both go to the gift shop to see if you can find one for you. Turns out they don‚Äôt sell them, which is odd since so many of the women here are wearing them. When you inquire to the staff about the gold bikinis you learn that they do actually keep them on site and in fact they are free. There‚Äôs only one BIG condition....",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9py8p/m4f_not_single_still_blacked/,,wrfuman,p9py8p,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9py8p/m4f_not_single_still_blacked/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9py8p/m4f_not_single_still_blacked/,0,2021-08-23

32[M4F] 1950s Americana - Specific but Sexy,"\*\* WARNING - I'm looking for a literate, detailed RP partner\*\*

I don't want to write with someone that puts up a great post and their responses in DM are VERY lackluster.  I've been wanting to write this prompt with someone for a long time but have been unable to find the right partner.  Is it specific? Yes.  Is it sexy as hell? YES.  Let's explore the prompt...

I've always had this fascination with 1950s Americana.  It was a much more simple time and the everything just seemed more ... innocent.  The wife stayed at home and took care of the kids, took care of the house, cooked all the meals.  The husband want to work from 9-5 in a suit and tie, came home, ate dinner, and relaxed the rest of the evening if he wasn't taking care of something around the house or the neighborhood.  

But you have to think, the people in that time period were innocent, yes ... but they were most definitely having sex.  THAT is what I want to explore.

Picture this: The perfect 1950s American family - Husband, Wife, two kids.  The wife spends her days at home in her checkered one piece dress, while cooking dinner with a white apron on.  Pleasantly waiting for her husband to arrive home to make sure that he's taken care of.  Remember, this is 1950s Americana ... in this specific prompt I'm not looking or interested in anything heavy ... no gore, violence, scat, anything like that.  Just good old fashion sex.  A great blowjob.  A nice cumshot on the face of a 1950s housewife.  

Before we get into the smut, I want to explore this world, explore this family, and explore the scene.  Trust me, I LOVE the smut, but let's build it out first as it always ends up better that way (:

I will only respond to DMs!! No Chat!! Let's spice this up a bit and make the subject line the color of your panties.  Also - females only please.  Looking forward to those little orange envelopes!",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9og4a/32m4f_1950s_americana_specific_but_sexy/,RP/Chat,CelestialBeings8887,p9og4a,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9og4a/32m4f_1950s_americana_specific_but_sexy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/p9og4a/32m4f_1950s_americana_specific_but_sexy/,0,2021-08-23
The Story My Orchiectomy,"This is a write up about my experience getting surgery. I was very unfamiliar with how the American medical system works on a day to day level. This by no means is a guide, but more of a reference to one person's experience. I hope this helps anyone looking for a little understanding about this procedure. I also included at the bottom a little thing on paying for my procedure using an HSA.

**Getting the Appointment**
I finally decided I wanted to do this a few months ago. I had gotten to a point at work where I could take some time off and I was financially secure enough to afford this. I researched for a while about surgeons in my area and locations that were covered under my insurance. I made the decision early on that I would not seek out a specific transgender related surgeon. Most places seemed to be pretty open to trans people in 2021 and the operation is so ‚Äòsimple‚Äô that any qualified urology surgeon could perform the procedure. I chose the University of Florida Shands Medical Center for the operation due to their high reputation in my area. I sent a message via their ‚ÄòContact US‚Äô page for urology and received a phone call a few days later to set up a consolation. I had the consult and was pleased with the way the surgeon answered my questions: experience with the surgery, trans patients, recovery, etc. I was glad I was choosing a medical center with the staff it has that would be able to take care of my outpatient procedure. Everyone was super trans friendly and treated me like a woman and used the right name and pronouns without question.

**Rationale for Surgery**
I‚Äôve wanted this surgery for a while now. There were different reasons why with the two main ones being medical and aesthetic. Medical reasons include less medication and better development. I was on a cocktail of Spironolactone and Estradiol. The Spiro was my anti androgen, a drug the blocks testosterone receptors. The drug has the side effect of also being a diuretic, meaning it pushes salt from cells and drags along liquid as well. This causes the body to urinate frequently. I was very tired of this side effect and almost resented the fact that my body took to Spiro so well. It also made me vomit almost monthly and as my testosterone levels plummeted. With testicles removed, my testosterone levels would remain naturally low and thus I would not need to take this medication. Long term I would also not need to take as much estrogen, resulting in less tension on my liver (where the estrogen is processed). Feminization should hopefully progress more now that my body can focus on building a female body solely, rather than preventing a masculine body as well.

Aesthetically, I hated tucking like a lot and only did it when I wore revealing clothing that I didn‚Äôt want a bulge showing. I hated feeling like at any moment something would slip and someone would see something. I used to be very athletic and loved to work out and do sports that were more intimate like jiu-jitsu. I‚Äôve put off doing them for various reasons including the fact that I moved to a new city a year and a half ago, then the pandemic hit, then I got promoted a lot in my job so time became a huge hindrance, but a big reason I never went to a barre or yoga class and instead worked out on my yoga mat in front of a video class was the bulge. But with that more out of the way, I might start engaging with the community more. God knows I need the exercise and it‚Äôd be nice to meet people outside of work or people that I didn‚Äôt meet on dating apps. 

**Pre op**
I had a pre op appointment a week before surgery to go over questions about the procedure and recovery. Whole thing took about 30 minutes. Afterwards, I was given special surgery soap to use the evening before and morning of my surgery. I made sure all my affairs were in order prior to being out for surgery. I had the procedure on a Wednesday morning and planned to be out Thursday and Friday as well. I met with everyone at work a week before my surgery to get all projects I work on under control. The day before, I got hugs from everyone at work wishing me well. I could barely sleep the night before which I think actually helped as being unconscious at unscheduled hours could really throw off my sleep cycle. I made sure I had enough stuff at my place to take care of myself: fresh fruit in the fridge, canned soup, frozen vegetable bowls, sports drinks to regain electrolytes, anything that was easy to make and healthy to eat. I also prepared all my medication at my bedside: my estrogen pills, generic ibuprofen, an antihistamine, tall glass of water, laptop, charger already plugged in, and extra pillows. I should also note that I made sure to ‚Äòget in shape for surgery‚Äô. By this I mean I made sure my cardio was decent and I was stretched enough to not feel tight while recovering. I did split training to make sure my hip flexor muscles were strong enough to support recovery as well as spine and leg flexibility. I think this helped a lot in the recovery process. 

**Day of**
I arrived at the hospital 2 hours before my operation and checked in. Had to explain the whole name thing, but other than that, everything was pretty straightforward. I signed some consent forms and received the magical blue wristband with MY name one it. After a brief ride on the aptly named Golden Elevator, I was brought from the checkin room to the surgical waiting room located just above. I had to thoroughly wash my hands, then proceeded to fill out a few forms. One was a contact sheet for the nurse to call after my surgery to arrange for pickup. The other was a more thorough version of the first. I guess the short one goes to the nurse and the other to the admins? Regardless, I waited about 30 minutes or so in this waiting area just browsing Reddit and listening to a podcast. I also received a contact card with my patient ID and a direct line for someone to call for updates on my surgery. I sent that to my dad cause he‚Äôs a nervous nelly. The guy managing this waiting room called me up and escorted me to the pre op room, where a team of extremely friendly doctors and nurses were awaiting my arrival. I was handed wet wipes with similar surgical soap to what I used the night before and told to strip and scrub. They closed the curtains around my bed and I did as instructed. All the while, I was answering questions from one of the nurses about medical history and my health. When I started putting on my surgical gown, my surgeon peaked his head over the curtain and had a mini conversation with him and we got pumped for surgery. My clothes were logged and my stuff was placed in a water tight bag and put in lockup until I got the recovery room. I didn‚Äôt bring much, just a small bag with a spare shirt and underwear, my AirPods, wallet, and phone. Things got super hectic and honestly super fun for me at this point. The nurse who handed me the wet wipes started getting everything set up on the bed and the other nurse continued to ask me questions. While all this was going on, every person on the medical team came over to introduce themselves. I met the anesthesiologist and his assistant and the doctors assisting with the surgery. I let the nurse setting everything up and the anesthesiologist assistant know that I was going to freak out the second the IV went in. They down played it just trying to make me feel comfortable and kinda doubting me since I had been joking around with everyone the whole time. As I warned them, the second the IV went into my right forearm, I started crying and felt a ton of pain. The assistant was kinda surprised at how right I was and said ‚Äúalright lets get you the good stuff‚Äù. He then pushed something and I started to calm down about 30 seconds later. I resumed joking around with everyone and was kinda shocked when they said that we were going to the operating room. Right as we started to roll out, one of the nurses mentioned that we forgot to put on my surgical cap. The nurses joked that everyone was distracted by my beautiful hair. They pulled my hair back and under the cap and pulled the cap over my ears. That was the last thing I remember. I have no idea what happened next if I was conscious for longer or if I just passed out mid sentence. I always thought that I would get to the OR first and that the doctors would talk to me for a second and they would but the breathing thing on and count me down. Maybe they did, but my memory stopped at the hair cap.  

**Post op**
I blinked from the earlier experience and starting hearing all the nurses in the recovery room yelling my name: ‚ÄúMikayla! Mikayla! Wake up Mikayla!‚Äù. I opened my eyes and saw the nurses around me kinda like the end of Wizard of Oz except instead of Dorthy gently waking and greeting her family I started crying hysterically and hyperventilating. I was shaking like crazy and was in so much pain from the IV spot. The nurse by the bedside was the same nurse who was asking me questions earlier. I was in a completely different place I didn‚Äôt feel as though time had past. The anesthesiologist assistant gave me something to calm the shaking and the nurse gave me pain meds. After a minute or so I was calm. I felt bad because my surgeon came over to see me and I was too hysterical to talk to him. I asked the nurses later to apologize to the surgeon for me. A new nurse wheeled me over to a private bay to get me changed. I normally am pretty reserved with my body, but I was so high on the drugs that I just let the nurse do what she needed to to get me dressed. A few minutes later she asked if I was ready to leave. No way was I ready. I heard a different nurse across the room calling my dad to make sure he was downstairs (he was). I tried standing with the help of the nurse and just had to sit back down. A few minutes later, I started joking around again with the nursing staff: ‚ÄúOh wow, I haven‚Äôt been this high since college‚Äù. I made it to the wheelchair and began my journey to the hallway. I had to put my mask back on, and made it 15 seconds before I turned to the nurse and said I felt queasy. He immediately turned the chair around and pushed me back to the recovery room. He asked for a blue bag, but I saw a sink and just dived in. I threw up pure water twice. It was so much water. They handed me a gatorade and a started sipping that to get some electrolytes back. They let me leave the mask off while I sipped my drink. I was still pretty high and was just waving hi to everyone in the hospital. I made it to the car no problem and started acting like nothing had happened. Not because of anything that happened or me hiding anything, I just felt normal. Talked to my dad about some stuff and joked around.

**At home**
We got to my place and he walked me up to my apartment and helped me lay down. I put on a movie and just ate some soup. Took some pain meds and tried to take a nap. I tried to position myself so my hip wouldn‚Äôt have pressure on it. Recovery wasn‚Äôt too bad: a lot of sitting and waiting. I only took the prescription pain medicine once the first night. After that, I took generic ibuprofen every 6 hours for the next 24 hours. What I didn‚Äôt expect was my neck to hurt so much. I don‚Äôt know if that was from the surgery or the way I slept, but it hurt and made my voice a little hoarse. I also didn‚Äôt expect that my abs would hurt as well. It felt like I worked out way too hard and were just sore whenever I tried sitting up. The transitions from the bed to standing and back were the only parts that were rough. Once I was up though, I could walk in shuffle steps and act relatively normally. Now a few days removed (get it lol), the dressing is off and my life is basically normal again. I haven‚Äôt taken any pain meds since 48 hours after surgery and only feel mild discomfort when moving in big motions and transitioning from laying down to standing up. So far I am amazingly impressed with the outcome and look forward to being completely normal again soon.

**Paying for this**
Ok so if you don‚Äôt know the magic that is HSA, LET ME TELL YOU! An HSA is a Health Savings Account. Under current law you must be enrolled in a qualifying High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) in order to have one of these, but if are or have the option to enroll in one, consider it! The IRS allows any individual to contribute $3,600 annually to their HSA pretax and it lowers your taxable income. You get a debit card you can use for any health expense be it medical, dental, vision, pharmacy, OTC medications, hygiene products, hell even Amazon has an HSA compatible list. When you spend this money on any of the above things, it is never taxed! If you don‚Äôt use all the money on the card in a given year, you can roll it over forever and contribute the max every year. You can contribute anything you want to this card up to the max and spend as much as you need. If you have a plan with dependents on it, you can contribute double so $7,200. For those of you not yet convinced, let me give you a real world example from my paycheck last month. I had booked the surgery a few weeks in advance so started looking into my finances to see the best way to afford this. I usually put $75 on my HSA each paycheck to cover costs like medication, doctor visits, and blood tests while also saving for surgery. I decided to put $300 on my card, anticipating about $200 less on my net pay. I was shocked to see that my net pay only went down $100. I decided to double down and put $600 on my card that paycheck and was double shocked to see that my net pay went down $300. Basically what happens is I take my gross pay, subtract my health insurance premium which is a pretax deduction, subtract another $600 dollars of pretax deductions and calculate my tax liability based off this new lower income. Because of this recalculation, my tax liability decreased by about $300, meaning I took $300 from my paycheck and $300 from my taxes and used all of that to pay for medical costs. I nearly cleaned out my HSA balance on this surgery cost, and will have some more costs soon. If you can delay payments a few weeks, you can contribute the cost to your HSA and use the pretax dollars to pay the bill.",u_aureliusjunger76,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_aureliusjunger76/comments/p9ogm5/the_story_my_orchiectomy/,,aureliusjunger76,p9ogm5,/r/u_aureliusjunger76/comments/p9ogm5/the_story_my_orchiectomy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_aureliusjunger76/comments/p9ogm5/the_story_my_orchiectomy/,0,2021-08-23

I'm so sorry I got in the way of you embezzling the McMoney,"I worked at two McRestaurants. I'm not going to reveal which McRestaurants these may be, but you may work it out.

The first was in my hometown before uni for 6 months. The second was in my uni's town for 18 months. The two McRestaurants had differing IT systems (one had an online system, the other just had paper) and so I couldn't simply be transferred.

I had to resign from one, get fast tracked through application at the other, and the people who McTrained me had an easy few shifts.

Lead up to being told what to comply to:

Now, the first McRestaurant was very strict, but a bit too easygoing. I had good customer service so was put on the tills every shift; I could combat every Karen with enough sarcasm and fake boomer humour to make them like me. 

When working on tills, the managers gave the till users their swipe cards so we could issue refunds quicker or delete an incorrect item on the order when a customer changes their minds ten times.

All is good. Each shift I walk in, count the McMoney, do my job, cash the McMoney, go home. I was almost always perfect to the penny. Until one shift, I notice a coworker using my till during my break. 

When I cash the McMoney that shift, I'm down by like a fiver and a few pence, and I'm given a Cash Retrainer (disciplinary and basically a pop quiz about cash handling) After doing so, I mention the other coworker to a manager and he tells me it's my fault for not constantly supervising my till and for not 'locking my till' during my break which I didn't know I could do. 

He happily shows me. Cool and good. He's nice and even shows me the legal writing that says I cannot leave the till - from counting to cashing - unless the till is locked... i can comply with that

The night I am finally forced to use this knowledge;

A year later. New store, new managers, same legal stuff. I offer to take a coworker's shift so I can afford to eat next week, and end up on a shift with a manager who has never asked me to go on till before... which is weird. I'm great with customers and despise cooking McFood. 

This time though, she was expecting the other worker but had already gotten the McMoney ready. I take it from her, count it, sign it off, and do my job. I start learning that she is working everyone HARD while she picks her nails and checks her phone. After a while she notices that we haven't had any orders for a little while and that I'm just stood watching her procrastinate.

""Stop standing around and DO YOUR JOB""

""Err... i am? We have no customers so I can't serve anyone""

She tells me to get stock for the kitchen.

""What? I thought you wanted me to do my job?""

""Yes. Do your job.""

""By the book McManager?""

""Yes""

""Okay. No problem. I will stay by this till like it says in the book"" (duh)

I continue to stand there and she gets irate.

""Look, McManager, the only way I will leave this till is to go on my break""

She rolls her eyes and leaves me alone. Yay! About an hour getting paid to chat with the customers and coworkers who are nearby the till!

Eventually, I'm asked to go on my break so I lock the till as per usual and do so. A coworker of mine (someone who used a flexible till next to mine while I was on break - a flexible till is signed off by a manager) said that while I was on my break she came to the till, got angry tapping the screen for it to do nothing, and stormed off.

When I came back from my break, I asked for her manager card.

""NO. It's for managers only, and YOU'RE just a till boy today""

""Wow okay, is this an extended break?""

""What?! NO go do your job""

""I'll be able to if you give me the manager card so I can unlock your till and DO my job? To be honest you can supervise since it's your card""

Again, she rolls her eyes, goes to the till with me, holds out her manager card, and I have to swipe it while she was STILL holding it because she wouldn't let go. The screen becomes responsive again and I unlock it. 

She seems to avoid me for the rest of the shift, while I just chill since it wasn't too busy. I have time for a proper laugh with some customers and I even have a drunken friend come in for a milkshake. She and I chat for a while and talk about the weird McManager.

End of my shift, the McManager is suddenly very nice and sweet, offers to take my McMoney and count it up for me and I can go home early!! Haha... no. I'm paid to the minute and want to cover my own arse, so I count it myself. 

Not quite perfect. 3 pence over, I probably just didn't give a few people their penny change when they walked away. But for a cash retrainer it has to be +/- ¬£1. I'm chill.

It was satisfying to irritate her so much while I took the role of procrastinating away from her for that shift. I was grinning on my way home that I had done everything as I should've and put a manager in her place. I even got a drunk friend buddy to walk home with!

Turns out there was more to it...

That was the most profitable Thursday evening in MONTHS. That evening was HUNDREDS of quid more profitable.. a lil investigation had been carried out because of this. Then they noticed it was the first Thursday evening in months to not have a perfect to the penny cash amount. Then they noticed that it was me who signed it off, not the normal person. 

Then they noticed that the signature of the other person didn't match with her signature on other shifts. Far too much for it to be a coincidence. CCTV showed McManager to be taking the till's McMoney into the office on the usual worker's break every shift. I got in the way of it this time for just doing as told and doing my job by the book.

Fired of course, fined of course, think she spent a small amount of time in prison but now I see her cleaning the floor in the colonel's chicken restaurant across the street.

Also, I probably would have trusted her to look after the till while I got stock if she hadn't been so rude",u_linkdeez_,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_linkdeez_/comments/p9ojbd/im_so_sorry_i_got_in_the_way_of_you_embezzling/,,linkdeez_,p9ojbd,/r/u_linkdeez_/comments/p9ojbd/im_so_sorry_i_got_in_the_way_of_you_embezzling/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_linkdeez_/comments/p9ojbd/im_so_sorry_i_got_in_the_way_of_you_embezzling/,0,2021-08-23

How a God‚Äôs tears brought about his death,"This is part three to ‚ÄúHow I became a God‚Äù. If you haven‚Äôt yet, please check out the first two parts and thank you for reading.

In the last part, we followed G as he presented an orb to T, an NPC friend, and begged him to use it if he was to ever change. T reluctantly agreed after he realized just what the orb was. Years, in game, have passed and G is standing next to his wife‚Äôs grave. After a short conversation, G is attacked by a demon who used an ethereal blade to distract him as the demon devoured the soul of G‚Äôs wife. Anger and sorrow filled G‚Äôs mind fueling his power and slowly driving him mad. Out of desperation, G sought out D and forced him to open a portal to the plane of fire.

Last time, I told you I would explain the reason for G‚Äôs wife being one of the many causes for why G and J don‚Äôt get along, so here it is (be prepared because this is a long explanation that I will try to keep short). G was originally the leader of his tribe, but due to a mistake he was banished. J, G‚Äôs older brother, reluctantly took up the leader position in G‚Äôs absence.

After G was banished, he explored the world looking for a place to die so that he could rid himself of the shame, but no matter how hard he tried he couldn‚Äôt be killed. This led G to a forest where he spotted a group of merchants being attacked by monsters. G killed the monsters but, because of the sheer number of them, G was only able to save a single person, an elven slave. G tried to leave the woman in a nearby town but she followed him back to the cave he had used as his home.

No matter what G did, the elven woman stuck to his side and eventually he grew to have feelings for her. Time passed and they were married and, before too long, expecting a child. The day their son was born was the most horrible day of G‚Äôs life. His wife, who had trouble throughout the pregnancy, passed away in childbirth. Sorrow gripped G and he thought about killing his son, whom he saw as the one who killed his wife, but some part of him wouldn‚Äôt allow it. So, instead, G took the child to the nearby town, the same one he tried to drop his wife off when they first met, and left him at an orphanage.

Two days later, out of grief for what he had done, G returned to the town planning to seek out his son, only to find that in those two days, the town had been burned to the ground. Only thing he found of his son was the charred remains of the basket he had left his son in and his wife‚Äôs wedding ring, which he had left with his son. After tracking down those that he had believed to have killed his son, G traveled to find his brother J to finally end his miserable existence, but J refused to listen and told him that he should live with the disgrace he brought upon himself.

After that, G tried to follow J and make amends for what he did while he was the tribal leader, but this only empowered J and created a larger divide between the two. When J finally learned about G‚Äôs exploits, his only comment was ‚ÄúYou never deserved her love.‚Äù That was the last straw and G separated from J, traveling on his own.

That is the backstory for why G‚Äôs wife was a big reason for the two brothers to be at odds. Now, onto what I promised y‚Äôall.

G stepped through the portal and paused to look around. He had once come to this layer of hell for a short while with the others, but this was the first time he had come here alone. While taking a moment to absorb his surroundings, G could feel the emotions bubbling forth. It wouldn‚Äôt be long until his mind collapses from the overwhelming power that now flowed through his veins.

Shuffling forward, walking being too difficult, G slowly made his way through the flame filled landscape, searching for the demon who had taken his wife from him a second time. He had no clue what he would say or do when he found the demon, he only knew he needed‚Ä¶ something. His mind was becoming increasingly clouded, his thoughts jumbled up, and thinking was becoming increasingly more painful.

G continued walking the path he had set for himself, killing all the lower demons that got in his way, until he finally found it. The greater demon sat on a throne made out of brimstone and the bones of its lessers as it chewed on a pointed ear.

‚ÄúDemon!‚Äù G shouted, he was bloodied, clothes torn, armor rendered, and his mind almost gone.

The greater demon glanced down at G and smiled. ‚ÄúWhat do we owe the pleasure of a God visiting our little corner of‚Ä¶ Hell.‚Äù He emphasized the last word, as if to make clear that G didn‚Äôt belong there.

‚ÄúYou took my wife from me.‚Äù G shouted, brandishing his sword as he readied himself for combat.

The demon seemed to pause for a moment to ponder this, then spit the pointed ear out of his mouth at G‚Äôs feet. ‚ÄúIf you want her back,‚Äù the demon said with a sickening laughter, ‚Äúthen have her. I have no more need for the elven maiden.‚Äù

This was the breaking point, the point where G, the young God of Death lost his mind. Everything went black for a moment and before he knew it, he was standing on top of a pile of hundreds of lesser demons. In his right hand, he brandished his sword that was caked in demon blood, and in his left, he held the greater demon by its throat. Blood trickled out of the Greater demon's mouth as his body limply hung there, suspended in the air by G‚Äôs own strength.

G let go of the demon's throat and watched as it‚Äôs body fell to the ground with a loud, yet descriptively quiet thud. G stared at the mangled body for a moment then, whether out of joy or madness, G began to laugh.

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt the one who killed her.‚Äù G said, the madness evident in his tone and eyes. ‚ÄúHe was never the one who killed her! I must find the one who did. Yes! The one who took her from me will die!‚Äù

G began tearing through the first layer of hell, searching for the one who killed his wife and killing all the demons who got in his way. He eventually came across the demon lord, the owner of this layer of hell, and a battle occurred causing the fabric of reality to tear. G finished off the demon lord, sending him flying into the air and crashing into the mortal realm.

This was it. G was sure this was the demon that took her away from him and all he had to do was finish him off. G crawled through the hole and slowly made his way to the demon lord, but as he approached D interfered, sending the demon lord back to it‚Äôs plane.

Infuriated, G charged D trying to kill him but, as he stepped closer, T stepped in front of him, blocking his path. A battle ensued, (I was pulling punches because his attack was enough to straight up kill the NPC in one hit) T reached into his pocket as he tried to speak to G, who wasn‚Äôt listening, his mind was too far gone, and pulled out an orb that faintly shown purple but inside it glowed a powerful green blaze that burned brilliantly.

T thrusted the orb in front of G‚Äôs face and shouted a painful word that sent G to the ground. G‚Äôs eyesight began to blur again and his sword arm, as if acting on its own, came up and cut T‚Äôs hand off, sending the orb flying. As G stood up, J appeared throwing T off to the side and the battle began and after two hours (in-game, 8 irl) J managed to finally finish G off, piercing a magical green blade through his chest.

As G lay on the ground, life slowly ebbing from him, he was gifted with one last glimpse of his wife. The end of the Gods was thought to have happened that day, but one God who remained hidden was still alive.",AllThingsDND,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsDND/comments/p9oqv6/how_a_gods_tears_brought_about_his_death/,Story,The_rebirthalgorithm,p9oqv6,/r/AllThingsDND/comments/p9oqv6/how_a_gods_tears_brought_about_his_death/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsDND/comments/p9oqv6/how_a_gods_tears_brought_about_his_death/,0,2021-08-23
[19] [Telegram] [F4A] Stealing from the wrong group of bandits,"
You where in the market of Whiterun, shopping for some new armour as you and your group had recently looted a cave and found piles of gold, though most your armour was nearly broken after fighting a dragon on the way home. You where asking the blacksmith for there strongest sets of armour when a small 3‚Äô8 [kobold](https://e621.net/posts/1663911) walked in, they where known for being sneaky little thieves, so you tried to keep an eyes on the 1000 gold that was in your back pocket. But as you took your eye off the kobold for a single, you felt the small clays of her hand slip into your pocket of gold, by the time you turned around she was out the door. You tried to chase her but the crowed of people from the weekly market stopped you, her size making it easy for her to get away. 

As you couldn‚Äôt do anything now, you went back home, the rest of your guild soon showing up, you told them what happened and you described the short, yellow kobold to them, and said whoever found her would get a reward. After a few hours, one of your men came bursting into your room with a smile ‚Äúsir, I got that little bitch‚Äù. Quickly running out you saw two more of your men holding the kobold, she wore tight black pants and a cloak over top that had an experience looking dagger on the side of it.

Now what will you do with this little brat? Simply fuck her till she can‚Äôt think straight, then let your men use her, sell her to the most cruel person you can find so she is beaten and tortured. Or maybe you need a new servant or wife, I am sure she could be a great wife, good cook, clean your cloths and more, up to you, maybe you wanna torture her to let go of your stress, just do it.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Limits: hyper and humans


Hey, thanks for reading that quick intro and I hoped you enjoyed it, but to put it in short, a kobold steals from you, you capture her, then you simply do what you want with her, from turning her into a little cuddle buddy to selling her to the most brutal person you can find, anything really. I would also love if this was longterm.

But first a few things to go over that I kindly ask you follow.


1: writing:

I ask that you only msg me if you can always write 1+ full paragraph with few spelling mistakes, and the more detail you throw in, the better.

2: First msg:

When you msg, I would ask that you can fill out the basic character info(ref, name, age ect) if you fail to do this, I will most likely ignore you. I am also only looking for realistic characters, so no hyper muscle or 14inch shlongs.

3: Timezone:

My Timezone is GMT+10, and I ask you are close to this or at least active when I am so we don‚Äôt get 1 msg a day.


If this caught your attention I am glad and can‚Äôt wait to hear from you, so when you msg me please send your ref and character info(aka: name, age, height, etc)

**Plots** 

*Plot 1 - Doctor/Patient Physical Appointment Theme*
Lalo is a young man in his early 20s, going to college and doing sports in the afternoon. Recently, an issue has been going off for the past three weeks to a month now. It's been the first time its happened to him but Lalo can't manage to ejaculate, during sex and jerking off. He has a great sex drive, healthy, athletic, does no drugs and is active fucking all these hot chicks. He decides that the best option would be to make an appointment at his local clinic with his doctor. It's been a while since he's been there and you've done some cases with him like checking his blood pressure or checking his height/weight. The last time you two seen each other was over a year ago. Since Lalo's original, local male doctor isn't present for the next couple days, it seems a female nurse/doctor is going to have to take his place and examine his patient's junk this one time. You accept to do it and don't think of it too much. Besides, your expectations on any man's penis in this city are low since there's been many cases where you've seen photos of each client for medical purposes with the rest of the doctor/nurse(s) in this building. Plus, your boyfriend/husband is average in dick size and you have gotten use to small or average penises coming through the door. Lalo in the other hand is a shower; a large fat cock hanging loose between his legs with a pair of swollen balls, full of so much warm fertile cum that needs to be emptied out. Hopefully, you'll be able to see if there is any damage on his testicles. At the moment, Lalo is making his way to the clinic, ready to take his physical and *not* knowing that you'll be the one checking it out and examining all that girth, those horse balls and his massive, beefy, bitch-breaking, juicy cock which will leave you speechless ones you ask him to take his pants off to start the physical... 

*Plot 2 - Cam Theme*
This plot can be about you as the sister, step sister or busty mom. In this scene, you been a cam girl for slightly over two weeks now. So far, it hasn't been going too well since you can barely get about 20 viewers in. All you do is not expose too much skin, only revealing your nice fat ass or flash your tits quickly from time to time. Basically, you mostly just tease and show off your lingerie to them. But, they want more. At home, its only us two. We barely have enough money monthly to pay for the rent and any other bills. Last month we were two weeks late after the due date. The manager was flexible enough to let it slip but warned us that if this repeats, we're out and losing the house for good. Great,¬† now the pressure is heavier than ever. You and me work, combining our salary together to get through life. We are struggling but you make this cam thing as your side hobbie to make some easy bread. To get the attention, you'll need to do more than just tease and play with yourself. Your audience wants to see you with someone else in bed. One customer in the other hand, made an ultimatum, an offer that is only available tonight. That is, blow and/or fuck someone. This person guarantees three digits from what he's willing to give. In the other hand, the most you've ever made was always underwhelming, anywhere from $10 - 35. The clock is clicking and the rent date is only a couple days ahead. The problem is, you have nobody to go to, perform with you. Then again, the first thought was your own brother/son. Are you willing to put your relationship on risk and end it up in an awkward/uncomfortable tone? It's just business right? He'll understand. It's more complicated and embarrassing then you thought. Your show is in an hour from now and this needs to be finalized, with a final answer.¬†You soon approach him with this one-time, kinky offer. (Everyone is age 18 and over) 

*Plot 3 - StripClub Theme* 
There was this popular yet ghetto StripClub in the country side where it had very sexy as well as dirty sluts working inside as the waitress, bartenders and strippers. It was all type of women from college girls (over 18) to married women, MILFs, GILFs, black chicks, white, Asian...etc. Music played in the background filled with all these types of color lenses flashing the place. They always made sure to serve the customers and make them feel satisfied. If it wasn't already a dirty business, there was more. Like fucking the strippers, bartenders and even waitresses. You had to pay but once the men got done having their way with these whores. Some ladies could be speaking to someone or leaned against the counter, washing something when randomly, a horny man starts fucking them right on the spot. You're allowed to bang the workers inside the place, go to a VIP room, backstage and/or the back door in the filthy alleyway. There are prices and every minute counts. There's a chalk board written with all the prices of anything the men want which includes BJ/HJ prices, Anal, Intercourse, Tit-Fucks, Doing/Receiving Oral, With a Condom, Without a Condom, Facials, Creampie, Mouthpie...etc. All of them have specific prices, others being more costier than the rest. The good part is that all these chicks are wearing slutty outfits, the best of the best. You name it, bunny outfits, fishnets and even some topless. And then one midnight, when the place was a little slow, a very hung man joins the party. Who is he going to choose? So many to choose from. What bitch is going to milk those massive balls of his? Whoever gets picked is going to have one hell of a night. 

*Plot 4 - Cheating Theme* 
You call to inform me to pick you up from the airport. I soon drive to the airport. From my house to the destination where you're at is about a 3 hour distance. Once I pick you up, we drive back home. I decided to take the country/town side of the road since the GPS said it was a much faster route since there was rarely any cars. We were making great progress before the car began to act funny. I barely was able to park and pull over off the road, near a motel. The car's engine seemed to die and act unresponsive. It was around midnight and the best plan was to rent a room together. We did so and got inside, only one bed available. It didn't help that the night was over three digits, super hot and well, after using the AC for fifteen minutes, it malfunctions. The manager said he'll fix it tomorrow and now we're both stuck in this shitty, mediocre, ghetto motel, sweaty and unable to sleep. We both strip down to very few clothes, revealing a lot of skin. You text your boyfriend to come to try to fix my car which he's an hour away. With him on his way, we're stuck until he's back. With our bodies rubbing on the bed from time to time and seeing each other's bodies, things start to get heated between us. The insane hot weather is messing with our hormones, making me grow an erection under my boxers and/or you accidentally rubbing your ass against my crotch. 

*Plot 5 - BBC at Night Club Bathroom/Cheating Theme*
You were in a relationship that has been going on for about two in half years now. You love your boyfriend to death but the last couple of months, it seems that the affection is fading slowly. There are probably two issue you always had to accept. One being that he is average size between his legs, around 5 to 6 inches. The other, he's always out with his friends and doesn't invite you to his friend's parties. And the past three weeks, you been sexless. Your man hasn't been interested in making love nor showing any kind of attention towards you. Not even cuddles. Who knows what's going on with him. It probably has to do with him working two jobs now. He always comes home late in the weekdays from work, very tired to the point where the man only bathes, eats and goes straight to sleep in a span of one hour. And when he does have a little more time during the afternoon which are weekends, its only boys time with his friends. At the same time, it might suck but you try to not think about it, going out with your girls on parties and night clubs.

SPIDER MAN: NO WAY HOME THOUGHTS,"(spoilers for LOKI)

In regards to the Multiverse, The finale of Loki takes place at the end of time and the flow of time is shown as circular. The death of ""He Who Remains"" is what causes the Multiversal War that lead him to creating the TVA in the first place, a timeloop. The branches shown were occurring all across the flow of time so the Multiverse did not ""begin"" it essentially always was. Which is evident by the fact that The Ancient One was talking about it in 2016 when she said that sorcerers have been drawing on multiversal energies for all of time. Also Dr Strange saying in the trailer that they know very little of the Multiverse isn't farfetched because if you think about it no matter how much you know about any given thing it would still be an infinititesimal in the scope of infinity. As for the version of Doc Ock, Electro, Green Goblin and other villians are probably variants as to not taint the original stories but also to revamp them without completely erasing their respective histories. Also Tobey and Andrew are probably going to show up at the end of the 2nd act and be major players or at the end of the 3rd act in a cameo capacity",Spiderman,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/paxdhk/spider_man_no_way_home_thoughts/,Discussion,supermankevv,paxdhk,/r/Spiderman/comments/paxdhk/spider_man_no_way_home_thoughts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/paxdhk/spider_man_no_way_home_thoughts/,0,2021-08-24
"As much I love animals, a lot of arguments animal lovers use to shame humans are shallows and easily countable","


Firstly, like I said, I love animals. I am totally against the way some people treat them and mistreat them. I consider that they are living things, not commodities, and I wouldn‚Äôt support seeing someone buy/adopt an animal if this person can‚Äôt take care of him.

Please take note that this post is NOT against animals, but against a type of people I see more and more : animal lovers. Not all animal lovers, obviously, but the ones that take EACH occasion they find to worship animals and hate on their fellows humans.

Because I think the arguments they use are really popular and accepted, today I will go against the crowd and say why I think these arguments are mostly stupids.

Argument 1 - I would chose my dog over a serial killer/rapist/anyterriblepersonyouknow

This argument is weird because if I had a rapist or a killer in front of me, I would not save him/her no matter what. 

This is even weirder because people that say that sound like there are SO much rapists and killers out here, when they are a minority. And this is EVEN weirder that this as nothing to do in the debate animals vs humans, this is like saying ¬´¬†I would save my friend over a violent animal that tried to kill me¬†¬ª. One is dangerous and one is close to you, do the same with two humans or two animals, this is the same choice.

Now if we put two strangers : one human and one dog. If both seem normal (not dangerous or mean), I would surely save the human. If the human is a kid, even against a puppy, I wouldn‚Äôt even hesitate‚Ä¶

The only arguments I can think of that justify saving the dog are : Because taking care of/feeding a animal is easier. Contrarily to a human, a animal is not smart enough to hide his behaviour : I would immediately see that a violent dog/cat is violent, when a violent human can seem nice in the first place. In this case, this is not ¬´¬†who deserve the most to survive¬†¬ª, but ¬´¬†who is capable to put me in danger the most¬†¬ª.

Argument 2 - Animals are not capable to hurt like human do

Completely false. Animals rape, kill (even outside of eating and protecting themselves), abandon their children, and even in some case exploit others animals.

Argument 3 - But animals don‚Äôt understand when they do something wrong

Not only we are not always sure this is the case, but this argument is most of the time weird and full of hypocrisy in certain cases.

I invite you to read about some cases of serials killers, especially the ones that were taught. Read about what they said in to the judge/to their advocate, and read what specialists say about them. A lot, a LOT of times, not only the killer isn‚Äôt even aware that what he does is bad, but also think that what he does is a blessing in disguise/that he helped the victim. This is why we have psychiatric hospitals.

That doesn‚Äôt make his acts less fucked up, but the question is not there, the question is about if the person is aware or not about how much what he does is wrong. And if you ask me who I would chose to save : probably neither. But a dangerous dog (dog for example) is less smart than a dangerous human, so I will at least feel more safe. This is also easier and cheaper to correct a dangerous dog, and I would be less disturbed by an animal like that than an human like that (less similar than me so).

In the case the human know what he is doing, this is one more time not an argument between animals and human, but an moral argument that we can also have between two humans.

Now for the hypocrisy part, it‚Äôs that the same people that use the argument ¬´¬†the animal doesn‚Äôt know¬†¬ª are the one who say the EXACT opposite when the animal is the one to suffer. An animal kills his baby ¬´¬†this is instinct, they don‚Äôt give the same importance to their baby than you¬†¬ª see his baby being killed by someone, suddenly the argument don‚Äôt work anymore ¬´¬†their baby are as important to them than mine is important to me, they are probably as depressed as I would be¬†¬ª.

And this is the case EVERY TIME.

Argument 4 - Violents dogs/animal pets usually are like that because of violents owners

Violents people are also violents because most of the time, they come from violent family. Stop acting like they decided, just one day like that, to be jerks. They usually come from an abusive environment and have a lot of traumas behind them. 

Argument 5 - Animals are less annoying than children

False, they are just easier to control and to educate because they are less smart. This is easier to react to their attitude because they are easier to decrypt.

Argument 6 - Humans destroy animals home

I am AGAINST deforestation and destroying animals homes. But let‚Äôs not  act like animal don‚Äôt destroy other‚Äôs animals home to construct their own, and let‚Äôs not act like humans don‚Äôt destruct others humans home.


Now I don‚Äôt say that terrible humans don‚Äôt exist, I just dislike this mentality of humans bad/animals good.

Humans can be great like they can be terrible.

"Entitled Dad assaults me for ""faking an injury""","Apologies for formatting, I'm on mobile. This is a long one, please bear with me. TL;DR at the end.

Backstory for context: I had just left the hospital about a week or so ago due to really bad pain behind my knee. So bad that I couldn't sit, stand fully upright, walk, lay down, nor bend or fully straighten my leg. It came out of nowhere and got progressively worse every day that I ended up bedridden for two weeks. Also to note that even though the summer heat is coming to an end where I live, I drank plenty of cold water to the point where I'd have to get up every hour to use the bathroom throughout the day. The pain was so bad that I would lose the urge and would just lay in bed all day, not even wanting to get up to eat or pee because it was so bad and sensitive to the touch that any movement would make me wince. Doctors were baffled, so there was a CT scan and an MRI done, as well as bringing in an oncologist because I had a large mass of fat behind my leg, a tumor about the size of a football. Hearing ""oncologist"" almost brought me to tears as I feared for the worse. I  Turns out what I thought was a really bad cramp was actually torn tendons and ligaments in my leg. I hadn't fallen or hit my leg against anything which is what confused everyone, and the large mass was just a fatty tumor, nothing too serious according to the doctors and surgeon. No operation was done, it's not cancerous, and I was told in a few weeks the swelling would go down and my leg should heal naturally. I've been using a walker since discharge and just recently the pain is much more tolerable that I no longer need it, but still use a walking cane because there's still a chance I could fall, and I won't risk it for a biscuit. Now that that's out of the way, on to the story.

I've been given hydrocodone upon discharge for the pain, but only for three days as it's pretty strong and one could possibly get addicted. So I've been taking Tylenol after my meds ran out as it's the strongest OTC medicine I could get. I have to keep my leg either very still while laying down, or constantly moving it (ie. walking) as it hurts if I stand still for too long. This incident happened 2 days ago. Instead of sitting at home doing leg exercises in bed and waiting for my dad to go bring me pain meds, I decided to go with him to keep myself moving hoping it would help me, plus spend more quality time with him (we've had a on-and-off bumpy relationship). So we head to the pharmacy and once we're there, I decided I also wanted some jacket snacks. I inform my dad about this, and so he doesn't have to slowly follow me around, I suggest he go out to get some quick groceries at the supermarket across the street. He agrees and we go about our separate ways for a while. I go around with a basket and pick my stuff up along with pain meds taking my time, then head to the counter up front. This is where the Entitled Dad and his son come into play. The son was quiet the entire time, didn't say a word.

As I'm standing in line, I put my basket down next to me and hold onto my cane. As mentioned before, it hurts to stay standing still for too long, and my hands start to wobble a bit as I'm struggling. ED is behind me in line and makes a snide remark about me struggling to stand, saying how I should ""quit being a drama queen, you can wait."" I turn to him and glare for a few seconds before replying, ""I have a bad leg, I can't stand for too long"" in a deep, irritated tone before turning away. As I do, this man has the absolute nerve to walk over and picks up my basket and starts rummaging through my items. I turn and demand loudly ""put down my basket now"" to ensure I grab other people's attention. He scoffs and hands it to his son (who's about maybe 6 years old and carrying their own basket) and keeps rummaging, picking out and commenting on my snacks and gets to my pain meds. ""What are you, some sort of junkie? What's with all the painkillers? You're getting off on these, aren't you?"" There's only 3 other people in line who are either staring or trying not to get involved. I ignore his question and ask for my basket back. This angers ED and he asks again in a much louder voice. ""You're getting off on these, aren't you?!"" as he throws the stuff back into the basket. I'm almost up to the counter next, but I walk a bit closer as my leg was now starting to feel a bit stiff and ask once again, for my basket. ED shouts ""fine!"" and as I hold my hand out to grab it he, instead of handing it to me, throws it forward towards me. I'm only 5'7"" and this man was about 6 foot something, pretty tall guy and threw it at chest height as if tossing a basketball. So basically he tossed it at my head. I put my hands up not to catch it, but to block it from hitting me in the face. As soon as it hit me, I was knocked backwards, stumbling with my leg in pain from the sudden movement as I tried to catch my balance or grab onto something, anything, so I wouldn't hit the floor. If I had fallen against the counter, it would have been much better as I'd still be standing, but I fell straight on my butt and onto my back, the rope around my wrist from my cane coupled with the momentum made the cane spin back and I landed on it with my right arm.

I can't tell you how much I screamed and cried in agony as I fell and lay there trying to move my body to my right side. I can't even sit down normally without pain and have to lean most of my body to the right whenever I sit down on the toilet seat, at the dinner table, or even sitting upright on my soft mattress. Any weight or pressure on my leg makes it hurt and it's uncomfortable and gives me backaches, so landing hard straight down was absolute hell. The other customers, as well as the cashier and store manager started shouting at the guy while trying to help me up. I declined, wanting to stay on the floor as it'd be much better than if I was sitting or standing, and demanded loudly for the cops to be called and to not let the man go, as I was sure as shit going to be pressing charges. ED doubles down and shouts back at everyone else, ""I mean look at him! He's exaggerating, he's not hurt! Look at all these pain meds *walks to my basket and takes out my stuff* he's buying! He's probably getting high off of these! (How in the fuck..?) No one person needs this many Tylenol, he's an addict! He doesn't even need this, *he proceeds to kick my cane away but the strap is still around my wrist* it's all fake, it's an act!""

As he's finishing his stupid speech, his voice is starting to shake as I'm guessing he's realized he's not gonna win this one. He goes and grabs his son's hand, puts his basket down and tries to speed walk out of the store, muttering something along the lines of ""c'mon *son's name*, we don't need this, we'll go to another store..."" but one customer blocks his path, as well as the manager who's already on the phone with the dispatcher and saying officers are on their way. Upon hearing this, ED bolts, dragging his kid along and shoves the customer blocking his path into the metal detector near the entrance. ED stumbles as a woman with her child in a stroller start to walk in. ED is dancing left to right, trying to get past the woman whose now just standing there confused as to what's happening. The shoved customer gets back on his feet, runs up to ED, spins him around 180¬∞ and tackles him to the floor, keeping him pinned.

Fast forward to my dad coming back and asking what the hell happened. I explained, as well as the other customers and manager. Police arrive after a while and everyone starts to explain what happened. Statement was given, charges were pressed, and the ED was taken in cuffs to the backseat of a squad car. His son stayed behind and would be picked up by his aunt. The only thing he said was ""I'm sorry"" before we left.

TL;DR: ED thinks I'm a junkie faking an injury to get high off pain meds and assaults me",entitledparents,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/paur79/entitled_dad_assaults_me_for_faking_an_injury/,XL,SugarySpaceSprinkles,paur79,/r/entitledparents/comments/paur79/entitled_dad_assaults_me_for_faking_an_injury/,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/paur79/entitled_dad_assaults_me_for_faking_an_injury/,164,2021-08-24

"22F arab, i let a white guy paper bag me cause I was drunk and attracted to him","




There was a party few weeks ago. I am quite average looking , a bit chubby and not the greatest face. I‚Äôm not sad about it and not looking for pity just being honest‚Ä¶ but I end up crushing on guys way hotter than me and way out of my league . And at that party I spoke to my crush asking him for a dance but honestly I was just too drunk  and really had no chance with him and I knew and he just rejected me. And spent the party with a way hotter girl .. 
so I just kept drinking and felt pathetic and drunk me started dancing and being embarrassing and flirty.. I was sad and desperate so yea‚Ä¶ I tried to hit on a guy who‚Äôs so hot as well he didn‚Äôt care about it.
But by the end up of the party .. there wasn‚Äôt many people left and he came up to me and told me to go with him ‚Ä¶ and I went with him.
I never do that ever‚Ä¶ but that night I was quite sad drunk and desperate that I just went for it and he was so attractive. I never been with someone in his league before .

So I thought I might impress him enough To get a date.

But when we got to his place he held up a paper bag and told me to either wear it or walk home cause he doesn‚Äôt wanna look at me..
He was very rude and rough.. I felt pathetic but I don‚Äôt know why , I just did it and let him have him fun 

I felt so pathetic and ugly that night but I didn‚Äôt know why I just tried what he wanted and that was so degrading .. felt like I was just a fleshlight to him

But he is still the hottest/biggest guy I‚Äôve ever had

Edit: please I‚Äôm not looking for confidence boost or pity comments.

"""The Kincaid Files"" EP 1"," 

*Ring! Ring!*

*Ring! Ring!*

Rex‚Äôs; eyes cracked open. His phone illuminated the darkness of his tiny bathroom.He grabbed the phone off the frozen tile floor. To his dismay, the caller I.D. read: Dumbass. Rex sighed and took a swig from the flask that laid next to him. The rubbing alcohol-tasting liquor flowed over his tongue and burned his throat as it traveled to his stomach. 

‚ÄúWhat stupid shit did you get yourself into now, Warren?‚Äù Rex said.

‚ÄúIt happened again,‚Äù Warren said.

‚ÄúYour date laughed at your pecker and left you with blue balls?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, asshole, things were going great until she turned into a monster!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere is she now?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs dead on my living room floor,‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll come over and remove the body. Be outside when I get there; I‚Äôll be there in five.‚Äù

The hairy man peeled himself off the floor. A horrible stench of trout guts overpowered his nostrils. A torrent of yellow vomit exploded from his mouth and filled the toilet. Tears and sweat poured down Rex‚Äôs face. He caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror as he wiped slavia and throw up off his lips. Dry yellow puke matted his long brown hair. Rex washed his hair out in the sink, then ambled into his bedroom. 

He flipped the light switch on and took a crumpled pack of cigarettes off his dresser.There were only three smokes left in the box, along with his lighter. Rex pulled a cancer stick out of the carton with his teeth and lit it up. Reddish-brown blotches stained the white wall, piles of dirty laundry, empty liquor bottles, and fast food bags littered the cold wooden floor. Flies buzzed around and landed atop the empty Wendy‚Äôs and Mcdonald‚Äôs bags. 

The smell of dry vomit and stale farts permeated his bedroom. He selected a dirty pair of jeans and a stained t-shirt from a mound of the clothes next to his bed. Rex put the filthy clothes on then stumbled to his closet. He swung the door open; shotguns, rifles, and handguns hung on the wall. A flameflower and chainsaw tucked on either side of the room. Rex grabbed the chainsaw and his hand cannon.

Rex pulled into the driveway of the old ramshackle house. The house‚Äôs blue paint peeled, pizza boxes, beer cans, and used condoms were scattered across the ankle-high yellow grass. Warren sat on the steps of his front porch shaking, smoking a cigarette and drinking from a cracked Champagne bottle covered in purple smut. Blotches of dark purple covered his spikey-blonde hair and red flannel; his Grateful Dead t-shirt had three ribs in the center like a lion had clawed him. Warren‚Äôs baby blue eyes lit up, and his dimpled face stretched into a smile. Rex opened his car door. Several Budweiser bottles avalanched onto the pavement. 

Rex lit another cigarette and strolled over to Warren. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you get yourself into?‚Äù Rex asked.

‚ÄúJust another awful date,‚Äù Warren said.

Rex pulled his flask from his back pocket and tossed it to Warren. ‚ÄúHere, drown your sorrows,‚Äù

Warren took a drink, then spat it out and coughed. ‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù 

Warren tossed the container back at Rex.

‚ÄúGrain alcohol. Sorry, I forgot you were a pussy.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù

Rex pointed at the gashes on Warren‚Äôs stomach. ‚ÄúI can fix that.‚Äù Rex tore a section of Warren‚Äôs shirt off and poured  alcohol on it, then pressed the rag against Warren‚Äôs wound.

‚ÄúOuch, fuck!‚Äù Warren yelled.

Rex drank from the canteen and burped. ‚ÄúSo, are you going to show me where the stiff is, or are you going to sit there and make googly eyes at me all night?‚Äù

Hesitantly, Rex followed Warren into the tiny house. The smell of death and rot assailed Rex‚Äôs olfactory senses. It looked like a tornado had gone through the living room. A leather couch turned over with yellow foam poking out of large gashes, the coffee table broken in half, a large spider-web fracture in the center of the TV screen. Dark purple coated the walls. On the floor there was a purple smudge where a body should have been. Rex‚Äôs temples pulsated, and his heartbeat sped up. 

‚ÄúWarren, where is it?‚Äù Rex said.

Warren stared at the stain on the floor. ‚ÄúShe was here just a few minutes ago.‚Äù

Something dripped onto Rex‚Äôs shoulder. He looked up to see a horrible monstrosity leering at him. The terror‚Äôs sixteen cyan eyes bared into Rex‚Äôs soul. The beast had an Angler fish head and mandibles on the corner of either side of its mouth; it had black plated scales? instead of skin. It's terrible head was covered in blood and had a dent in the center of the forehead. The freak dropped onto Rex. He pointed the pistol at the fiend‚Äôs head, but it smacked the gun out of his hand as he pulled the trigger. The gun shot bounced off the walls. A sharp ear-piercing ringing deafened Rex.

Rex grabbed the beast by its neck as he grabbed his flask. He took in a mouthful of booze and flicked his lighter on, then blew a fireball in the mutant‚Äôs face. It shrieked, then jumped off Rex. The savage juddered its head until the flames extinguished. Rex charged it with the saw raised over his head; the behemoth kicked him across the room. Rex crashed against the wall, then thudded to the ground. Agony radiated through his body. Blood trickled down the back of his neck, darkness filled in the edges of his vision. The abomination turned its attention to Warren. It dashed across the room and sunk its claws into his soft flesh. Tears and snot poured down his face.

‚ÄúWake up, Rex!‚Äù Warren screamed.

‚ÄúYou will make a tasty meal for my family,‚Äù the demon said.

It raised a clawed hand to tear Warren‚Äôs throat out. The tell-tale sound of a chainsaw filled Warren‚Äôs heart with hope. A circular blade sliced through the creature‚Äôs arm, an arc of blood sprayed Warren in the face. The oddity stared at its stump incredulously then dropped  while Warren and howled in pain. Rex swung his chainsaw like a baseball bat and cut the thing‚Äôs head clean off.

Warren wiped his face with his sleeve. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy guess, it‚Äôs a Gorrashin,‚Äù Rex said.

The severed head cackled. ‚ÄúYou think you‚Äôve won?‚Äù This is only the beginning. My people are already on their way. They‚Äôll turn your little town upside do-‚Äú

*Bang!*

Rex blew the smoke off the barrel of his gun and shoved it back in the holster. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm charging you double for this,‚Äù Rex said as he headed for the door.

‚ÄúWait, where are you going?‚Äù Warren said.

Rex turned to Warren. ‚ÄúHome. The less time I spend with you, the better,‚Äù

Warren rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúDid you not hear what she said, asshole? There‚Äôs going to be more of those things coming to Burningham.‚Äù

Rex shrugged his shoulders. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs probably bluffing. Didn‚Äôt want to go down without having the last word.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if she‚Äôs not?‚Äù Warren said.

‚ÄúWell, if any monsters show up at your doorstep, shoot first and ask questions later. Until then, I‚Äôm going to sleep this hangover off, night.‚Äù",scarystories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/pas71t/the_kincaid_files_ep_1/,,Logan966,pas71t,/r/scarystories/comments/pas71t/the_kincaid_files_ep_1/,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/pas71t/the_kincaid_files_ep_1/,4,2021-08-24

What‚Äôs the stupidest thing your district is making you do this year?,"For us it‚Äôs swivl cameras even though we are strictly in person (also no mask mandate, but that‚Äôs a whole other thing!). Last year our district purchased them for everyone to use for hybrid learning. Nobody liked them, they weren‚Äôt very effective for us, and they caused way more headaches than anything else. Teachers ended up just using them as an iPad stand. Well this year our district isn‚Äôt doing hybrid learning at all, but swivl cameras are still expected to be used to record every single lesson and uploaded to the swivl cloud for students who are out with covid. I teach at a k-3 school and somebody please tell me what little kid is going to sit in front of pre-recorded lessons at home all day and get anything valuable out of it?? For those of you who teach elementary school, you know it‚Äôs a little bit of talking and a whole lot of walking around helping kids hands on. So the student at home is going to be watching 5-10 minutes of talking and then 20-30 minutes of watching the teacher walk around helping students.

"The schizoid depression trap, how does one deal with it?","Not sure where I am going with this post, I guess I am just feeling stuck, and want to see where other people might relate, or have advice. I am pretty much a covert schizoid and have really suffered heavily with the anhedonia piece lately, like to the point where I cannot fathom knowing what to do with myself every single day, just waiting for the day to pass to night, wake up and repeat, everything feels dreadful. On top of that I struggle pretty hard with major depression, anxiety, and the fun rumination that comes along with these disorders. 

In the past, I was able to stave off the existential dread and anxiety that came along with realizing, I do not think I truly feel or care about anything or anyone, which is extremely depressing and difficult to work with. Of course, I do not want this to be the case, and I want to want things, but internally, I cannot find it. To manage such existential anhedonia, and stave off further depression, SSRIs have kind of helped, and I was able to distract myself with forcing myself into activities, getting into graduate school and studying my ass off etc. I have even been able to maintain romantic relationships which I saw more as a thing of companionship, and it was nice for my sometimes workable but unfortunately fleeting sex drive. Of course this was all very stressful, and difficult, but it helped me not confront my unfortunate internal state, and run from the anhedonia of realizing, I am not internally compelled to do anything, at least not in the current state I am in. 

Well unfortunately, due to some medication switching issues, and accumulating stress, I had to drop out of grad school, break up with my girlfriend, and move back to my home country with my parents all within the matter of a month. It almost feels like my graduate school experience never happened, and I did not feel like I ""missed"" my girlfriend at all. 

I fell into a pretty deep depression with somatic manifestations, and have been suffering awful anxiety and sleeping issues that have not made anything easier. This expereince has sent me into a partial hospitalization program, where I am partaking in group therapies and seeing a psychiatrist. I am not sure the therapy is  helping. I am really at a point where I am confronting my inner self, a self that seems to be completely anhedonic, without a true compulsion to do anything or go anywhere. 

I guess my purpose in this post is to ask questions. How does one who suffers from schizoid type traits, deep anhedonia, and pretty deep depression work their way out of this place? I have spent maybe the past two months passively suicidal and really not sure what to do with myself. I know I need to move forward, find a job, do something with my life, but I really can no longer fathom wanting to do anything with myself anymore. I keep trying to move forward, force myself to meet people and socialize, find activities that spark something, and I keep failing miserably. 

I am not sure what came first, the depression, or the schizoid type being, but it is an ugly ugly mix that really feeds off itself. When you have seemingly innate traits of anhedonia and a lack of purpose, there is not much to work with therapy-wise to pull yourself out of a depression and find a drive to push eachday through all the bullshit. It was been truly painful, frusturating and isolating going through these struggles these past few months. Yet, somehow, I feel completely void of emotions and able to hold myself accountable to complete any task. This has been a truly strange experience. 

I try my best to do the CBT and acceptance based therapy lessons and apply them to my life, however, I feel like most of it is relationship and emotion based. What good does much of this do when you have anhedonia, a lack of emotions, and relationships really do not do much for you? Ontop of that, I try to confide in my parents, but none of it helps. Many people may try to compliment of give me advice, or words of encouragement, but none of it makes a true change of feeling within. So therapy does not seem to help, medications do not seem to help, and seeing friends is just boring and does nothing, often making me feel worse that I am this way. I would love to change this, but how can you change something within?

TL;DR: Went to grad school, failed, and am now confronting a depressive episode ontop of some deep, aimless anhedonia.

Hi,
I'm a 46 year old MtF in my 4th month of transitioning. I have always known that I was different since I was very young. As a child growing up I fought to understand myself and what it ment to be me while living in two Christian homes. My Mother(who divorced my F
Dad when I was 3) raised me as a Catholic. I went to a Catholic school until i was in 8th grade, and attended mass regularly. During this time I would visit with my Dad every other weekend. He had remarried by the time I was five to a Seventh-day Adventist who taught me faith from her point of view. (I deeply love my parents and have a profound respect for them) Around eight years of age I started to explore who I was, experimenting with makeup and crossdressing. My Mother quickly found me out and shamed me to a grinding halt. In seventh grade my Mother let me move in with my Father and stepmother in hopes of helping improve my failing grades and poor additude. Mt Mother did not realize that this move was a blessing for me. My Dad was a over the road truck driver and my Stepmother worked a full-time job, leaving me to be a latch-key kid. My stepmother was just my size and I took full advantage of the opportunity  to be alone. Eventually, I built up the courage to tell my parents via a not left on the table, that i wanted to be a girl. Here again i was shamed until i suppressed all visible desires to be female. This did not stop me however and the suppression of myself led to a lot of selfharm and abuse of my body. At 18 I moved out of my parents house and by the time i was 19 i was in my first heterosexual relationship to a really sweet and kind girl who had no idea of my gender struggles. This suppression led me down bad paths as i tried to conform to the expected. At the age of 20, in a fit of drug induced haze I castrated myself, and in the process nicked a vein. I remember getting into my car to drive to the hospital that was 45 minutes away while trying to slow the bleeding with my hand. I must have blacked out at that moment because the next thing I knew, I was sitting in my car, the hospital parking lot, in a pool of my blood. My parents had me committed to a mental institution where I continued to try and understand who I was. There was no real help for me there though as being trans was still considered a mental heath issue. I moved back in with my girlfriend (who had never left my side) but within a year I had split with her without any real reason. I was just moving on I guess. For the next four years I roomed with my best friend. I had practically grown up with him as our families both attended the Adventist church. During this time my faith in God grew exponentially and I became a warrior in Christ. But still, in the back of my closet,, hidden but not forgotten was my transgender identity. When I turned 25, I met the love of my life through a random crossing of paths on an MSN messenger chat forum. (Yes I'm that old). Six months later I flew 800 miles  across the US to meet her for the first time. At this point I had not to her that I was a eunuch. I prayed earnestly that if she was truly the one, that she would accept me once I told her, without hesitation.  She never  looked back. Instead within two weeks I had packed everything that I owned and left my home, job, and family to be with her. Three years later we moved back to my home state. One year after that we were married. In all this time I never strayed from my cis gender role. Shortly after we married I took a job on the road building water towers. This job eventually led me to taking a welding job 1000 miles away from home. Long nights and far away places gave me plenty of opportunity to stray. Finally one night in 2005, after a long weeks work and an eight ball of coke fueled reasoning, I snapped. The next day I went to the store and purchased make-up and clothes, determined that I was going to finally transition.  Well, anyone who has had a good coke bender knows that the cold steeled nerves of determination can fade as quickly as they come. My faith began to convict me and before you knew it I was purging everything that I had (so I thought). I came home  at least every three months and I would give my receipts to my wife for filing taxes. I did not realize that I had unknowingly placed my reciept for the make-up in the pile. The look of utter confusion and disbelief that crossed my wife's face when she found it was heartbreaking. I tried to explain but couldn't. From 2005 to 2011 I fell in and out of myself in vicious and highly contested fuel and purge cycles. In that time I taught my wife that being transgender was to be someone who was attacked by and decieved by Satan. That only made things worse as she now would fight me like a demon herself to save me from that fate. It nearly killed us both. I quit my road job in 2011 and moved back to my home state in hopes of ridding myself of the curse of being transgender. That didn't work. I fell in and out of faith after moving home but never denied God's love for me. I just didn't understand why I had to suffer so much. Finally I got real with myself  and in May accepted myself for who I was. Shortly after I confessed my truth to my wife, she began to go to church, something she had never done (save a couple of times) in our 20 years together. Within a couple of weeks she was pressuring me to trust in God rather than how I felt inside. I have no problem trusting in God, but I flatly told her that I was not going to stop transitioning. She has insisted since then that by maintaining my position to continue transitioning that I am not truly trusting in God. I have tried to tell her that me not stopping my transition is not a lack of faith on my part. I fully trust that God will lead my way. He has been by my side this whole journey. I love God. I don't want to loose my wife. She means everything to me. But I don't want to loose me either. .",TransChristianity,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransChristianity/comments/patw1r/christ_is_my_way_now_where_did_i_leave_that/,,Anna_St_James,patw1r,/r/TransChristianity/comments/patw1r/christ_is_my_way_now_where_did_i_leave_that/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransChristianity/comments/patw1r/christ_is_my_way_now_where_did_i_leave_that/,5,2021-08-24
My miserable year isn‚Äôt so miserable anymore without her.,"
if you need back story please refer to my previous post. So basically long story short my mil wanted to see son for alone time. At this point he‚Äôs 5 months old exclusively breastfeeding and I don‚Äôt pump enough for him for work let alone visits. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with her having him alone and don‚Äôt understand why she needs time with him without us. Not only that but I was going back to work and would only get weekends with him. So I said no not right now. We can bring it up again when the school years over. (I‚Äôm a teachers assistant) this was at the end of may. So she needed to wait three weeks. This is where it all kinda abrupted. so the next day my boyfriend got texts and calls (from his step dad)  saying how horrible of people we are and called my boyfriend names. Saying we need to just do what his wife asks. My boyfriend was mad and when he‚Äôs angry you know it. He texted his mom and basically said how dare you bring step dad into this especially since I‚Äôm at work. This is uncalled for. He was not nice and I probably made it sound more gentle than he was. So he said he needed to cool of and give him some time. During all of this she gas lit him. Saying he didn‚Äôt know any of this was going on. But it all leads back to her running her mouth. Well his mom reached out to him for stupid stuff like fishing lures. (About 2 weeks later) He went off and said your acting like nothing happened and again she gas lite him. Well she has brought so many people into this making BF out to be the bad guy. So we went NC. So we had a vacation planned with her for July before all the drama accrued. So in June Sil (Sil lives with mil) texted me asking if it was still on. I asked boyfriend he said no. So we canceled vacation with them to avoid drama. Sil texted back saying all of this has been blown out of proportion and my boyfriend just needs to get over it. So my mil runs a business out of her home. I was picking up my BFs mail (we got his mail changed over now) for the last time. I made sure that Mil, Sil, and step dad were not home. One of the workers asked how we were. I said good tired but good. She then said so I know what‚Äôs going on and boyfriend just needs to say sorry to Mil it‚Äôs not that big of a deal.  She still sees photos of my son on Facebook we just aren‚Äôt reaching out. So she deleted herself from the group that has my  sons photos.  she then texted boyfriend asking if he deleted her from group. (This was probably a way to try to reach out) he said no and re added her and Sil. This was on the day I posted professional 6 month photos. (This was July) Which I‚Äôm sure her mom asked her if she saw and then she texted my boyfriend about getting ‚Äúdeleted‚Äù eye roll. But now fast forward to this month. I‚Äôm going back to work soon so I asked for recommendations for daycare on a Facebook post. She texted me. She said she could watch my son for free. I was as polite as possible and said no basically you need to resolve this before we even consider that.   She gas lit me and said she doesn‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs upset . So fast forward to yesterday my boyfriend noticed that Sil deleted him and myself off the book of faces. He asked why? And she went off saying how horrible we are and we treat her mom like shit. That she doesn‚Äôt want to play games or watch what we post. He said back this doesn‚Äôt involve you and it shouldn‚Äôt ruin our relationship but whatever if that‚Äôs how you want it to be I guess I don‚Äôt have a family anymore. His sister didn‚Äôt care. I feel like she‚Äôs (Mil) made herself out to be a victim in all of this and it‚Äôs been blown way out of proportion. All she had to do was wait three weeks and I would have let herself have him alone for an hour or so while I ran to the store. But at this point I don‚Äôt want her around my son until it‚Äôs resolved and then even then it‚Äôs going to be VLC until boundaries are proven to be listened to. And even then no unsupervised visits. She can‚Äôt say anything nice about us and continues to make herself out to be the victim. I do t want her saying anything bad about us to our son. After I posted my previous post I don‚Äôt have an Aita question anymore. I know she‚Äôs the asshole. Now I‚Äôm just posting this because it was to therapeutic to get it all out. So I‚Äôm open to advice in fact I would love it. With the holiday season coming up I‚Äôm sure Mil or flying monkeys with try to reach out. We aren‚Äôt spending any holidays with her and we decided that together. So I‚Äôm wondering how should I deal with holidays? Little ones birthday? Presents? My bfs birthdays in September, November‚Äôs thanksgiving, December‚Äôs Christmas, Sons birthdays I‚Äôm January. I‚Äôm thinking she will reach out for at least 1 of these events. How would you respond if you were us?",JUSTNOMIL,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/papyu7/my_miserable_year_isnt_so_miserable_anymore/,Advice Wanted,Annual_Ad_3432,papyu7,/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/papyu7/my_miserable_year_isnt_so_miserable_anymore/,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/papyu7/my_miserable_year_isnt_so_miserable_anymore/,44,2021-08-24
Fleshlust,"I watched it happen in the street again this morning. 

The woman shambled out of the dark corner in between the two apartment duplexes on 5th and Terra. She was dressed from head to foot in dried viscera. Her eyes were stitched wide, black and excreting black discharge. She saw a child walking by. 


*Her son?....*


It made no difference; The boy‚Äôs fate was sealed as soon as she‚Äôd spotted him. In but mere seconds; she let out an enraged shriek and she leapt upon him. Her teeth would rend the boy of his soft, tender flesh. The child‚Äôs resistance was pitiful at best, only able to scratch and kick at his attacker. His squeals for mercy were heeded by none.

I could only close my eyes and pray his suffering would not endure for long. I‚Äôd witnessed these occurrences for too long now to feel much beyond a slight weight of sorrow, unable to even shed a tear for the poor little lamb. The boy must have indeed been her son. For once she finished gorging herself upon him, she cradled that which was left of his shredded carcass to her gore-stained bosom and wailed in anguish to the sky. 


*Just like you, Harry...*


Suddenly, others gathered from all directions, surrounding her. They all displayed various stages of cannibalistic mutilation across their bodies. Their eyes, too, were jaundiced with a feral hunger. Instantly, the mother reverted back to her former animalistic state and she leapt to attack the newcomer in the center. Her strike came true as she seized him and promptly fixed her jaws to his shoulder. The effort would prove vain, however when two others would rip her off of him and proceed to devour her themselves before then ripping mindlessly into each other. 

I remained behind this dumpster in the alley across the street from the scene, silently envying the mother and her boy. 


*Their pain was over.*


Do not think of me as callous or cowardly for wishing to remain in the shadows as those I knew once as others mercilessly slaughter each other. It‚Äôs not the fear of a gruesome end at their hands that frightens me. Rather, its the endless despair I‚Äôd cast upon myself. I can feel the same hunger burn furiously inside me even as I write this; the primal desire to consume the flesh of another.

I‚Äôve been combatting this hunger for at least the last ten days. Every time the sensation coursed through me, I‚Äôd seek from my pocket my photograph; the last photograph of myself and my son at the park that I took from his bedroom to remind me of the promise I made. This is where my tears would make themselves known. I‚Äôll never forgive myself for what happened. Though, with the passing of the previous two sunsets, Ive found the distinct loss of more and more of my stamina to resist going out and giving in.

What exactly *it* is, and how it started; I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell you. The things I *do* remember, however, are when it started here in my small town. It was just three or four months ago when mass reports came in about citizens being found in the act of devouring each other. Unlike what one would expect, there was no progression into this hellish anarchy. It was abrupt; only mere hours before, these cannibalistic animals were simply neighbors and friends.

From there to the present; as well as to the foreseeable future, this waking agony has been the way of life.

At first, we thought it may‚Äôve been an unknown contagion. This was quickly debunked, however, as the phenomenon seemed to occur too spontaneously and frequent for it to be an infectious spread. It was as if a switch had been flipped and all of mankind had turned feral in an instant. My family, when we could still be a family, called it ‚ÄúFleshlust‚Äù. 

Maybe that‚Äôs all it really was at first: a lust for flesh. It would‚Äôve been the simplest explanation, wouldn‚Äôt it? But no, I would later see that this was something far worse than that. This was more akin to a force of nature. This was something that couldn‚Äôt be fathomed or understood by human comprehension. Even calling it ‚Äúthe wrath of god‚Äù would be a lie. That would imply that we as humans could‚Äôve prevented this. 

I‚Äôve seen the truth, however; the awful truth. This was all pre-ordained. This was how life was meant to carry on. Not long after it began, I began to experience premonitions. I saw the Fleshlust occur and re-occur for a millennia. I could see the world essentially destroy itself; every life form turning on each other. Each time, only one would remain, only to live on as something else entirely, subjugated for as long as this earth existed as it reformed and recreated life, only to destroy it again in the same manner. A never-ending cycle of torment.


*The meaning of life?*


The other thing I can remember was that the first one to succumb to it was my son, Harry. We had, naturally, bunkered ourselves inside our apartment after the first hundred or so reports of people being found in the act of mindlessly devouring each other; barring the windows and doors and storing a large supply of food. We thought that abstinence from the outside world would provide security from the Fleshlust, indulging in the fantasy that it would pass and we would be okay in the end. For a time, we felt satisfied with this conclusion. Times were hard, but we could feel safe in our home; we had each other, and that was enough. 

But one night, I was awake in a cold sweat after another of the nightmares to find that Martha wasn‚Äôt next to me in bed. I‚Äôd remembered that she said she was checking on our son because she said she heard noises in his room. I‚Äôd heard them too; they sounded like growled chanting. It was the same thing I‚Äôd heard from others who‚Äôd been affected by the Fleshlust, therefore I simply thought it was just a drove of them circling the house outside. I wasn‚Äôt worried by it ‚Äî they couldn‚Äôt get in.


*She should‚Äôve been back by now...*


That‚Äôs when I heard what sounded like the growls of two dogs wrestling in a cage coming from Harry‚Äôs room down the hallway. I heard screams follow immediately afterwards, causing me to bound out of bed and down the hall. When I got to the door, it appeared to be jammed. I could hear the growling getting louder and the screams got fainter. 

‚ÄúHARRY?!‚Äù, I shouted, pounding furiously on the door,‚ÄùMARTHA‚Äù?! The only response from the other side was a cracked, fading cry that was followed by an animalistic shriek. I started to ram the door with my shoulder, causing it to begin splintering the further it was stoved inward. As I kept battering the door, I could hear, in a hoarse, cracked voice: *‚ÄùAdrayok Melioss‚Äù*. 


*How did they get in?*


*Have they already gotten Martha?!*


*Is Harry okay?!*


*Oh please, God, don‚Äôt let me be too late!*


Finally, the door collapsed off the hinges and I immediately turned on the light. The sight that I was greeted to was what will always be the worst moment in my life. There, sprawled out on the floor with her stomach flayed open like a fish, was my sweet, beautiful wife. Harry was hunched over her, stuffing more of his mother‚Äôs organs into his mouth. I wanted to vomit; not even because I was disgusted, but because of the panic and disbelief. 


*How could this have happened? We were supposed to be safe....*


He looked up at me, his marbled eyes excreting the black ichor, *‚ÄùAdrayok‚Äù*. ‚ÄúH-Harry...‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt know what to say. My knees started to buckle. In an instant, he lunged at me, seizing me and sinking his teeth into my throat. I was paralyzed, both from pain as well as shock. 


I struggled to pry him off of me, but his teeth were sunk deep into my throat. It felt like the more I tried to push him off, the more of my throat would be torn away. I finally had to jam the tips of my thumbs into his venomous eyes to make him release his jaws and throw him off of me.


He was relentless, however, and he was upon me again in seconds! He was on top of me, having toppled me over by hurling himself into me like a spear, and he began using his little fingers to dig into the gash in my throat, howling in the air ‚ÄúADRAYOK MELIOSS‚Äù! 


I could feel my vision cloud over with each second. I had begun to lose a good amount of blood by that time. I closed my eyes, not wanting my last memory of my son to be of the deranged beast he was in that moment. 


*What end to life was this; mauled by my own child?*


That was when I saw the same scene from my nightmares play out again. This time, It was like I was right there, in the actual vision, feeling all tithe pain of those that were being viciously ripped apart. But a new feeling then followed close behind.


Anger... wrath... 


Hunger...


*‚ÄùEnd him‚Äù*, a voice boomed from inside my mind. The voice was indescribable; definitely inhuman. The new sensations began to make my head pound and throb, worse than the most aggressive migraine could ever produce. All I could think of was the need to taste human flesh. 


*Is this what the others saw? What they felt?*


When I opened my eyes, I could see Harry roaring to the air with chunks of gore hanging from his bottom lip. I felt my eyes starting to burn and I grabbed him by the throat, constricting as tight as I could,before hurling him into the wall behind him. I stood up, feeling a new surge of aggression that seemed to be supplying me with energy and strength, despite my serious injuries and loss of blood. I had no bearing on any higher reasoning or thought, only craving for flesh.

For only a brief moment, I swear I saw Harry‚Äôs little eyes change back into their former dark brown color as he looked up at me, almost scared. I towered above him, ready to grab him up by his throat and tear him limb from limb. ‚ÄúDaddy...‚Äù, I heard him squeak out. His eyes were wet, but not from the ravenous venom from before. No, these were actual tears.

For a moment, I just leered over him. My mind was scrambling, like I was caught in between the mindless urge to feed while at the same time feeling a bit of conscious will to resist. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared, Daddy...‚Äù. With that, I felt my higher brain function return and I knelt down to embrace him, tears now freely falling from my own face. He nestled his little head against my chest and clung to me for dear life. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay... Daddy‚Äôs here... Daddy‚Äôs here‚Äù, I quietly whispered to him, feeling him quiver in my arms.


*‚ÄùDaddy won‚Äôt let anyone hurt you‚Äù*.


I just held him there for hours, sitting in the middle of his bedroom beside the half-devoured carcass of his mother. Eventually, the both of us slowly drifted off to sleep. Of course, the nightmare plagued me again, causing me to awaken for a second time that night in panic. My son was still fast asleep in my arms.

My head throbbed again and I felt the hunger return. *‚ÄùEnd it!‚Äù*, the voice boomed again. Though I couldn‚Äôt place where the unnatural voice was coming from; FAR less *whose* voice it was, something seemed familiar about it... almost...


Natural...

*Was this the voice of God?*


The pounding became frantic; *‚ÄùEnd it! Return the flesh to the earth!‚Äù* I was confused, afraid, and yet angry at the same time. What did it mean? What even *was it*? I looked down at Harry. The hunger returned, more furiously than before. All I could imagine in that moment was what his tender flesh would taste like. Before I even realized it, I found myself drooling. My eyes began to burn again and I felt the black discharge run down my face again. 

‚ÄúDaddy? What are you doing‚Äù? I saw him staring sleepily up at me. What *WAS* I doing? Horrified, I instantly let go of him, ‚ÄúN-nothing... here, go back to sleep. It‚Äôs alright‚Äù. After I tucked him back into his bed,  cautiously kissing his forehead, I quickly and quietly left the bedroom. I took one last look over my shoulder, seeing him once more fast asleep. *‚ÄúDaddy won‚Äôt let anything hurt you‚Äù*. 

That was the last time I‚Äôd see my son. When I left his room, I quickly scrawled a message to my son; telling him that I‚Äôd always love him and that I would miss him, but that it just wasn‚Äôt safe for me to be around him. I wrote that I wouldn‚Äôt let him see me as one of them; as one of the mindless slaves of the Fleshlust. Finally, I wrote to him to be safe and not to come looking for me. I placed the note on his nightstand and placed the photo in my pocket. 

I knew he wouldn‚Äôt ever understand ‚Äî he was only a boy. But it was the only sure-fire way I knew he‚Äôd be safe. That morning, before the sun had even fully risen, I tore down the boards to one of the windows and fled down the fire escape into the alley between this and the next door complexes. When I landed, I could hear a few others roaming about and I quickly found cover behind the dumpster. 

From that day until now, I have remained hidden here. Often, especially when I see or hear sounds of the others engaged in a struggle nearby, much like with the mother and her boy, I‚Äôll look up and wonder if my son is still okay. Sometimes, I‚Äôd wonder if he‚Äôd disobey my warning and try to seek me out. I pray he never does.


*He‚Äôd never even recognize me anymore...*


At first, it was relatively simple for me to resist the growing urge to feed. The photo and the promise that I wouldn‚Äôt let him see me as one of them was enough to bring me back to my senses. When it slowly became more and more potent, that was when I sought another means of relief. Using my old fishing knife, I would carve out bits and pieces of my own skin to try sating the cravings. Painful as it always was, it seemed to work, for while at least. But as it grew, I had to carve out larger portions of myself to satisfy it. 


*Maybe I‚Äôll finally carve too deep and it‚Äôll all be over...*


Each time I did, I‚Äôd always see my son‚Äôs face in the photo, *‚ÄùDaddy won‚Äôt let anything hurt you‚Äù*. 

Even this has now begun to lose its effect, though. I found this to be the case when I spotted a stray cat wandering into the alley yesterday. It was just a simple white kitten; oblivious to the hell around it. By that time, I had just finished carving out my calves and was consuming them. Then I saw the kitten, the soft, tender, furry and vulnerable creature. Slowly, I crept towards it; leaving for the first, and so far only, time from behind the dumpster. Just like with Harry, all I could think of was devouring this little creature whole. The pounding in my head was the most intense it had ever been. 


*I promise you, you‚Äôll never have to see me like them...*


That‚Äôs when I stopped. I couldn‚Äôt do it. The kitten looked up at me, it‚Äôs eyes simply observing me, unaware of the threat I almost posed to it. That was when I heard a scurrying come from the end of the alley. ‚ÄúADRAYOK‚Äù, the scream rang out before I saw the kitten be snatched in an instant by one of them; a man with most of his face torn and flayed open. Like it was a small morsel, I watched as the man devoured the kitten almost whole. He turned to me, his blackened, ichorous eyes sizing me up. I stood frozen, waiting for him to strike. 

He wouldn‚Äôt have the chance, however, before another; a woman with bits of meaty flesh hanging from her mouth, charged the man and pinned him down. I watched as she ravenously tore him to bits.


*Always a bigger fish...*


When she was finished and he was barely even a hunk of meat on the ground, she raised her head to the sky and screamed ‚ÄúADRAYOK MELIOSS‚Äù while hastily tearing the skin from her face. Before I could react, she bounded from the man‚Äôs body and brought me to the ground. Using her nails, she tore deep into my open wounds. The searing pain was soon drowned out by rage as the hunger returned. 

I grabbed her by her throat and proceeded to squeeze as hard as I could. She fought back, but her attempts were feeble against my hold on her. ‚ÄúAdrayok‚Äù, I heard myself utter as my grip tightened more and more. Eventually her flailing arms started to go limp. I thought my head was going to explode from the pressure of the pounding inside. *‚ÄùHer Flesh is weak, end it‚Äù!*

‚ÄúADRAYOK... ADUAE...‚Äù; I stopped. I could see that she had now lost consciousness, not appearing to be breathing. 


*Had I killed her?* 


I checked for a pulse. Sure enough, she was still alive. I quickly scurried away from her, retreating back to behind the dumpster. The rest of the day was spent thinking, pondering what I‚Äôd just done. I looked at my hands, the hands that came so close to causing me to break my promise.


*My hands cannot be trusted...*


That was when I began to carve the skin from my hands, using that to futilely attempt keeping the Fleshlust under lock and key. It was probably one of the most painful parts of me to remove, but it was the only logical thing I knew to do in that moment to spare me a far more grievous pain in my heart. 


*I promise you, you‚Äôll never have to see me like them...*


Eventually, however, the shock from pain and blood loss caused me to fall unconscious. At first, My dreams came vividly to me in the form of a memory; the last memory I have of my family being happy. I saw Harry and Martha, running around in the park near our apartment. 

...


*‚ÄùTag, you‚Äôre it‚Äù*, Harry squeals, laughing. *‚ÄúYou better run, I‚Äôm gonna get you‚Äù!* *‚ÄùCome play with us, Daddy!‚Äù*


...


*‚ÄùOh no! I‚Äôm hit! Man down!‚Äù*, I shout to him. He pretends to ‚Äúradio for backup‚Äù while gunning down imaginary enemy soldiers.


...


*‚ÄùSay cheese‚Äù*, I say, staring at the camera; Harry beside me. *‚ÄúCHEESE‚Äù!* 3... 2... 1... *Snap*


...



*‚ÄùDaddy... who is that‚Äù*? He points to the grove leading into the nature trail. A man is shuffling towards us, his eyes black and skin tattered and mangled.  *‚ÄùHe looks scary...‚Äù* he tightly grasps my leg. I put my hand on his head, *‚ÄùIts okay, buddy... Daddy‚Äôs here‚Äù*. The man is now only a few feet away. I ask him if he‚Äôs okay. He just continues forward...

*‚ÄùAdrayok...‚Äù*, I hear him mutter. Harry‚Äôs hold tightens around my leg. *‚ÄùYou and your mother go get in the car‚Äù!* He just stands there, holding onto my leg. *‚ÄùGo on, it‚Äôll be okay‚Äù*...


...



The man lunges forward and grabs onto me, trying to bite at my face. I‚Äôm just barely able to hold him back. I‚Äôm able to shove him away and scramble towards the car. I look back to see him giving chase close behind. 


...


I make it back to the car. When I look behind, the man is being swarmed by others just like him. They rip him to shreds, devouring every bit of him before then ripping themselves apart with their own hands.


...


The next thing I see, however, is something new entirely. I began to see the mutilated carcasses begin to seemingly melt and spread across the ground beneath me. It continues to spread until the ground is nothing but living, pulsating flesh. That‚Äôs when, from the new fleshy landscape, people are formed, screaming. 

That‚Äôs when I woke up. It was dark by then and everything was quiet. I looked once more at my skinless hands. The chilling breeze stung the exposed parts all over my body. 


*Why am I not dead?*


That led me to further ponder the latter part of the vision. 


*Is this all there is? Is this the secret of our existence; just common garbage bound in skin, only to be recycled?* 


It came as no surprise that I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night. One thing has made itself clear to me: the dead are fortunate. They no longer have to worry about carrying out such an existence. They don‚Äôt have to feel the pain; pain of conscience, pain of loss, or physical torment. They just get to blissfully slip away, hopefully ignorant of the truth. 

I hear it happening again. I wonder who it‚Äôll be this time; two childhood friends? Former lovers? Maybe even just two strangers, never even knowing one another before. In any instance, they‚Äôll be nothing more than scraps of meat on the sidewalk in most likely less than five minutes. 

I think this time, now that the hunger is kicking in again and I‚Äôm running out of the endurance to continue resisting, I‚Äôm gonna go out and I‚Äôm gonna pray that when they finish whoever they‚Äôre feasting on, that they‚Äôll make quick work of me before I have the chance to do the same to them. Most of all, I pray that Harry, my baby boy, never has to see the truth:

Lifelong Experiencer/Visitations,"Hello everyone! I have been contemplating posting this for quite a few days. I have been visited by Greys since I was a child, and sometimes other beings as well. I am 23 years old. I had a full panel psych evaluation in 2019 that took many hours and many weeks, and am diagnosed with bi-polar depression and general anxiety disorders. Nothing that would cause me to hallucinate or see/hear things that do not exist. I am not sure if that's important here because everyone is so open and friendly, which is part of the reason I am posting this. 

***I have documented most of my experiences previously, and am going to just write out what I have documented and also what has changed. I will start from the first document, and then to the next so time will be chronological from when I was a child, to now, 23.***

&amp;#x200B;

**This was my first documentation from 2016 in contact with Bonnie Jean Mitchell**

I want to start off by saying how I feel as a human. I am 18 years old, almost 19. My entire life I have been considered extremely smart, borderline genius, and I have only gotten sick twice. I have always felt like I was here for a specific reason. I often feel like at any moment someone or something will approach me and tell me I am needed and that I will be given a task. I probably shouldn't forget to mention that I have an extreme sense of other people's feelings and thoughts towards myself and others, I can tell when something negative is going to happen before it does, and I have more than enough Deja Vu. Since I turned 17/18 my feelings have gotten much stronger. Every day I feel more and more like I have this task, but so far nothing has happened. Now to the encounters.  


The first encounter that I can remember with something ""non-human"" (that's what I prefer to call it for now) was when I was around the age of 4. I grew up on a farm with my grandmother, and my mother had a house on the back of the property. One day I walked to the back of the property to look for my dog. I went to the barn, and it had one section that was ground-level and another that was raised off about 3 feet, and you could see under it to where the goats and pigs were kept. I remember, so vividly, looking under the raised part of the barn to see if the dog was inside the pen, but I saw something. It was non-human, and it was a grey/white color, and it was just sitting there staring at me. I was so frightened I ran back to the house, and I never told anyone.  


The next encounter I remember was not really with myself, but with a family member. I woke up one night in the bed with my grandmother and she wasn't there. I looked everywhere for her. I looked in all of the spare bedrooms, all of the bathrooms, she was not in the house. I was so scared I ran outside to my mom's house and got her to come back with me to show her that my grandma was missing. But, when we got back, she was lying in the bed asleep. It had been less than 10 minutes and she was back in the bed exactly where she should've been, and when she woke up she said she had never left the bed.  


I was in the bed with my mom one night, in my grandma's room, where I normally slept (I have been and was terrified to sleep alone until I was around 15 years old, no one knows why) and all of the sudden I was woken up because the entire room filled with a blue light. I was so scared that I never looked up from under the covers, and my mom wouldn't wake up when I shook her. When she finally woke up the room was back to normal, and we looked everywhere for a source of the light thinking it might've been the TV, but the TV was off, and we never knew what happened.  


Once again, I was in the bed in my grandma's room, and I woke up in the middle of the night. At the foot of the bed were three non-humans. They were wearing my clothes! I just watched them, mainly because I was paralyzed with fear, but after watching them for a while they just walked into the bathroom, and I never saw them again.  


Recently, and this is what has shaken me up the most, I was in my apartment (I moved out to a city about 45 minutes away, and I have a roommate and a very large two story apartment with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms) and I was dreaming, but the dream was so real. I was even wearing the clothes I fell asleep in. All of the lights in the apartment were off except for one, and it was in my laundry closet upstairs in the landing. I remember running through my apartment upstairs afraid of something. It began in my bedroom. I ran into my bathroom because something was after me. I ended up running out of my bathroom and bedroom to the stairs, and as soon as I started to run down the stairs something grabbed me. It was a non-human. As soon as it grabbed my arm I was not afraid anymore. He or she was a yellowish cream color. The same body type as the other's I had seen throughout my life, but this time it was a different color and it was in a dream, not when I had actually been woken up in the middle of the night. I was and am still shaken up by it. The only thing I remember being said by the non-human was when it grabbed my arm, and it was something along the lines of ""do not be afraid.""  


My entire life I have struggled with a fear of the dark, mainly in my bedroom. I cannot look into dark rooms where the door is open. I cannot sleep with my closet or bathroom door open. I have also frequently, but less frequently now, struggled with being woken up and feeling paralyzed. I could move my mouth, but when I screamed nothing came out, and it was like my hearing was impaired.  


More often than I would like, but not on a nightly basis, I feel like someone is watching me. I know something is going to happen because everything will go silent and my ears will start to ring. My body also tingles or vibrates and that is how I know ""they"" are close. Sometimes, but more so memorable since I have lived at my apartment, I have been in my bedroom completely alone with the door locked, but I will be woken up by what sounds like someone walking in my bedroom. Sometimes I hear whispers or voices too. When I lived at home I would know ""they"" were coming because I would hear humming buzzing noise and my ears would ring. Some nights I would be lying flat on my back and all of the sudden it felt like my body was being pulled into the air at an extremely fast rate.  


I am not skeptical of ETs or the paranormal. I was raised by scientists to be a scientist myself, and currently I am a biology major in college. I am not religious, but I have this extremely strong feeling that a God exists. Not the God like the Christians have, but something even larger, something that is physical and with extreme power and intelligence. I graduated high school early, I am extremely smart, and I am well-liked by everyone. But, I am starting to feel like I am going insane. Hearing the voices and whispers, believing that things are in my bedroom, and feeling like I am being watched. I am scared. Very scared, but, I am scared of my own mental health, not of something physical. I am reaching out because my entire life I have felt like I have been visited by non-humans, but it has recently reached a point that I can't keep quiet anymore. I need someone to talk to who has had similar experiences as me. I am not sure at all of what to do, but I am extremely willing to do whatever it takes to get rid of my fear and denial of personal contact with non-humans.  


Last night I got the feeling that I was going to be visited again, so I found this website, and I read post after post after post, and I bought the site moderator's book and read it all night. I have a very personal connection with some of the things that happened to the person that wrote the book, but I just need answers. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Two weeks after the first documentation in 2016**

A couple weeks back I posted my story here for the first time. I took the advice of not being afraid, and last night I had an amazing experience! But, I do have a question. I was wondering, because it has happened twice now (possibly 3 times), if anyone else has had a similar experience of having to go under a robe/cloak or mask of some type to be able to leave your.. um, in my case, bedroom.  


My experience last night was again very similar to Bonnie's! I was taken by my non-human friend from my bed, in a kind of negative way, I remember being physically dragged out of my bed, but it wasn't a big issue because I recognized him, and he reminded me that he told me not to be afraid.  


After that I was in a very large room, I think it had white walls, white everything actually, but the fun part is that it was a teaching class! There were a lot of people in the room, I remember introducing myself and telling multiple that smiling and laughing was normal and positive for humans. I am almost positive that most of the people in the room with me were hybrids or different species of non-humans, but it was very very exciting. As soon as I woke up I wrote my very first journal entry because I remembered everything so vividly. I am excited to see what happens in the future! 

&amp;#x200B;

**Almost 6 months after the second documentation post**

I was visited again last night, I think. It has been a while since I have had an experience with my ""star friend"". Last night was not one of them. I woke up to see quite a short being at the foot of my bed, just one. They were standing at the right side and they were maybe a foot taller than my bed, so about 3.5 feet tall. I don't remember much it's very in and out, which seems to happen quite a lot when this happens to me. I could never get a clear view of anything more than the outline, and as I was staring trying to see it was like my lights went out, which is also a common thing to happen to me during these visits. As I kept staring a very small light appeared that was very bright. It was on the upper side of the being's chest. It was like the light entranced me. I tried to get out of my bed to go up to it, and it was very difficult to move, it felt like I was moving very slowly, sort of like I was fighting to walk, and as I got up to it my eyes closed and all I could do was move my legs very slowly, so I stuck my right foot out to try to touch it, and I believe I brushed the being's foot. It was very cold, not like human skin. It felt much smoother and more rubbery than human skin as well. As soon as that happened I blacked out and woke up. When I woke up a little bit over an hour had gone by, and this is the most memorable experience I have had with ""lost time"".  


I was wondering if anyone else here has experienced something similar. The cold touch of their skin? The lights going out? The small light near it's upper chest?  


I did not feel like there was any negative energy coming from the being. Recently I have been trying to open myself up to not being afraid when things like this happen, as I have been told before by my ""star friend"".  


I have been reading about how many different types of beings there are. And, how a lot of people who have made contact or connection to their beings that visit them can sometimes telepathically communicate with them. This was also the first time I have experienced that. I assumed that I was so shaken up that I made up a voice in my head to calm myself down, but no matter how many times I try to recreate that voice in the part of my head that it spoke to me I cannot. I asked very politely and very generally in my head to ""please leave me alone tonight I am sleepy"" and I got very proper, general answers back with each request or question.  


I was also wondering if that was normal. I would very much appreciate any feedback.  


P.S. I have not seen my star friend in what seems like weeks or months. I was wondering if anyone ever experiences lapses in their visits or if there is a good way for me to communicate with it. I am quite missing my small yellow friend.

**2019 I saw my first, and only UFO**

In May 2019 I was sitting on my porch in rural South Georgia. We are surrounded by trees, and near my house there is a hill that we can see everything on, we are also near an AFB.

The UAP that I saw was about the size of a public transportation bus. It was glowing completely in a fiery orange color. I would watch it move slowly over the trees for a few seconds, and then it disappeared. One second later it appeared hundreds of feet from where it was, and also at a different altitude. It is one of the most spectacular things I have ever seen. I don't even know how to describe the vindication and emotions I went through. 

I mentioned the AFB because after I told someone about this, they sent me a link to people in the Valdosta area, in Valdosta Daily Times,  that had seen the exact same thing as me, except reports going back 70 years. [https://www.valdostadailytimes.com/news/local\_news/look-up-in-the-sky-reviewing-south-georgias-ufo-sightings/article\_a020bfad-3dd5-5371-935d-9c5cdd8d130d.html](https://www.valdostadailytimes.com/news/local_news/look-up-in-the-sky-reviewing-south-georgias-ufo-sightings/article_a020bfad-3dd5-5371-935d-9c5cdd8d130d.html)

**Current - 23 years old** 

After seeing Anjali's press conference I felt vindicated. Over the past two years I have become very spiritual. I meditate daily, and get clear answers to my questions and teaching lessons from my spirit guides/source. 

Previously I assumed that the Greys, the visitors, were off-world from another planet somewhere in the galaxy, just more advanced biologically and technically than us on Earth. While I am leaving that as an option because I do not know the answers, I have slowly begun to lean more towards the concept of energy beings/interdimensional. I have not been visited by the greys in a while, unless I just do not remember, instead I have begun being visited by these translucent humanoids that shimmer with light. I call them shimmers because it looks like waves of light in a human shape. The press conference, along with any other interviews and posts from other experiencers, and the UAP discussions from the government made me question what I think I know. 

I would like to also add that since my experiences, one in particular, I realized that what I thought was happening in the physical world was actually happening in some altered state, like a dream-world, but not quite. It is like they take us, but not our bodies if that makes sense.

I am still learning and growing and it's very exciting, and I want you to know that I do not KNOW anything these are just my experiences.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know if any of you have had similar visits or similar conclusions or perception/idea changes of what was happening. I am curious to know about anything that relates to this whether personal, or a link to someone else's own story. 

I want to thank you so much for reading my story, and for any responses you have to it. And if you see this Anjali, I am very grateful for what you have said, and the plans you have. You are one of my inspirations for posting this.

I prefer being broken up with over text,"Everyone always gets angry with people for breaking up with someone over text, and how horrible it is. I've been broken up with over text and the first thing my family and friends said when I told them was how awful it was for her to break up with me in that way.

But honestly, from someone who's been broken up with both over text and in person, I **much** prefer being broken up with over text.

When someone breaks up with you in person, you have to look them in the eyes when they say they don't want to be with you anymore. You also have a much smaller window of time to respond to them, which is awful when your mind is racing, full of hurt and confusion. Over text, you can take the time to properly say what you want to and edit your responses. Not only that, but in person, often you have to hide your emotions or try your best to stay calm and not cry. At least in the beginning of it. Over text, you can let those emotions out privately without guilt or fear of judgement from the other person or anyone around if you're being broken up with in public (which in my opinion is **the worst** way to do it), and you can do exactly what everyone wants to do after a breakup, crawl into bed or onto the couch and let it all out. Plus there's no awkward ""I guess I'll leave now"" moment for either of you. No teary eyed drive home or seeing their car leave your driveway, you can be on the fast track to releasing your emotions and healing.

So whenever I hear about someone being called a coward or being chastised for breaking up with someone over text I get a little confused, at least for me, because I would prefer it that way.

I'm not saying this is the ""superior"" way to be broken up with or anything. But I like that way instead and do think it's a bit dumb so many people are so disgusted by it when there are a few upsides over being broken up with in person.",The10thDentist,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/pafms6/i_prefer_being_broken_up_with_over_text/,Society/Culture,BettyLoops,pafms6,/r/The10thDentist/comments/pafms6/i_prefer_being_broken_up_with_over_text/,https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/pafms6/i_prefer_being_broken_up_with_over_text/,13,2021-08-24

"(4'11""/145lbs) How can I stop being so damn lazy and put more effort into losing more than 5lbs a year without going crazy","Hey all!   
I've been trying to lose weight for about 5 years now, but only really started consistently tracking about 2 years ago. My highest weight was 160, lowest since I've started losing was 142. It took a little under 2 years to go from 150 to 142.  
I tracked everything, condiments and oils included, cut out regular soda for sparkling water and diet, and ate anywhere between 1200 and 1500 a day, losing less than half a lb a week, and gaining it back the next week. 
I never worked out until February this year. Me and my boyfriend decided to do workouts together, but we're LDR and different timezones so it's still pretty much solo. At first I tried HIIT because I was told it was the fastest way to lose weight. Well, for me it was the fastest way to gain a few lbs because after 1 week of doing it I wanted to die and then binged for the next week.  
   
After that I tried weighted exercises with resistance bands for a few weeks. Almost everything I did HURT. And not ""I can feel the burn"" hurt, like actual knees hurting so bad from squats that I can't walk the next day. 
Soni toned it down and tried just walking. Nope, after a 30mim walk I get home and my shins are radiating pain and I don't want to move for the rest of the day.  
  
So basically I've been sedentary forever. After about 2 years of tracking, I just lost it in July and have been eating whatever I want for the past month and a half, and gained about 3 pounds. Basically what I lose in a year. I'm just SO FED UP with consistently tracking every single bite I eat for so little reward, and when I try to do better and get active I get rewarded by pain and it just frustrates me to no end.  
 
I WANT to put more effort into losing more weight, but I don't know how when it seems like everything is working against me. 
 
Mostly a rant but looking for some advice too &lt;3",PetiteFitness,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetiteFitness/comments/paulwm/411145lbs_how_can_i_stop_being_so_damn_lazy_and/,Rant ,chickenandtea,paulwm,/r/PetiteFitness/comments/paulwm/411145lbs_how_can_i_stop_being_so_damn_lazy_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetiteFitness/comments/paulwm/411145lbs_how_can_i_stop_being_so_damn_lazy_and/,14,2021-08-24
Stand Boss Stand Name: Twist Again,"Read Before Posting/Voting¬†
With each round and battle, you will vote as to which Stands would prevail in a battle against this boss under certain conditions. These conditions are:

Location: Santa Monica Pier¬†

Time: 8pm

Weather: Cloudy, Moon Out

Population: 300+¬†

Awareness of Boss: Aware of Stand and User, but he's also aware of you and your Stand. 

The poll will ask who is likely to defeat the Boss Stand. People are allowed to team up, but note whoever gets the least votes will be eliminated. Also be sure to make it only a tram strat should you chose so. You must stay in this group until the very end. No new members can join once a strategy is given.¬†

Should at any point it is declared that a person/team is able able to defeat the Boss soundly and logically, they will be given immunity from the poll. However,¬† should everyone get it, that immunity is revoked.

Localized Name: Twister Time

Namesake: Let's Twist Again by Chubby Checker

Type of Stand: Short Range Humanoid Stand

Stand Appearance: Twist Again is an orange colored stand with black lines running across its body, making diamond shapes all around. In some of these diamonds were the number 0, though there wasn't any pattern ad to where they were. It's hands had white thick lines from the back of the hands to a quarter up its arm. It's front face was a pink pastel, as if a mask with the rest still orange.¬†

Ability: Twist Again has the ability to either add, subtract or change a random number into 0, forcing a real time change in order to make the change factual. For example, if it showed one had 420 dollars in the bank, TA can change the value by adding 0 (4200), subtracting 0 (42), or changing a number into 0 (400). This would in turn force the real world to acknowledge the change, actually shifting to make sure the statement remains correct.¬†

I'm order to use the ability properly, the Stand must be able to change an actual value in real time. Whatever value it's changing must be true of the moment, or it will make no effect. Furthermore, the Stand is only able to change the value of one particular concept once. It can not change any value that has been changed once before or will be changed again if changing a different value.¬†

While the Stand is able to do this change on any surface or object with a value, it also uses the white lines behind its hands. The user can have the Stand find values and numbers of actions happening around it, which will write themselves onto the Stand and allow it to change it. There are fundamental limitations. Such as:¬†

The stand cannot change mathematical pillars and principles, such as removing 0 from the concept of math, or changing infinity to 0.¬†

The reality shift can only apply to one object or concept at a time. If multiple objects or concepts would be changed with the value shift, the change will not take effect.¬†

Reality shifts that involve creation due to the value shift is more difficult that reality shifts where destruction is involved. The Stand does not always have the power to completely create something from nothing. And if the change is too large to accomplish, it will no go into effect.¬†

The values of what it can change must remain in its range, otherwise anything beyond it will not be changed.¬†

The stand will disappear if the user is killed, unconscious or voluntarily brings it back.¬†

Stand User: Garland A was an old man who figured his family had the worst lives when it came to fate. His only son. Lou, had become a lazy man who married an equally repulsive woman, who was bearing his child at only 17 years old. Garland watched his family I'm despair. The once proud man of a successful steel factory had watched his fortune wasted by greedy family and lowlife individuals. His only saving grace was that of his granddaughter. Whitney.¬†

Despite having negligent parents who soon made more children, leaving Whitney more on the outskirts. Garland saw potential and fire in her eyes. For years he did his best to try to get Whitney into a proper setting with what little money he had left, to raise her proper beyond that of her younger siblings and parents. However, the destitute of her surrounding overtook her. He watched he devolve to that of her parents. Drunk, mild abuse and carelessness seemed the path she was heading, much against Garlands wishes. He watched her devolution until eventually, when she turned 19, she mysteriously disappeared.¬†

Garland believed the worst had overcome, but he was much too old to take any action himself at the age of 76. His was more furious of the indifference her parents were, justifying their lack of concern with their other 3 children they had to watch. Yet, in only a few short years, she returned home.¬†

Garland was shocked, relieved and mystified by her return. She came back more poise, elegant and intelligent than he last saw her. Two to greeted each other, were she told him her journey. Of her rock bottom state, meeting a man named Dio Brando. They shared a common history about the unfairness of the world, how it leaves the best in ruins. She spent the next years with the man, learning his true essence and philosophy. Most importantly, they discussed the Heaven Plan, a way for all living beings to know and accept their fate while allowing Dio to overcome it. She, however, refuted the Plan, noting that concepts like fate and gravity are far less important than that of the human soul, the motions of oneself to channel these forces. As she put it, a soul must first be forged to overtake these concepts and bend them free of consequence.¬†

She remarked his desire to follow this plan, though the Joestar family defeated him before he could start on it. Managing to save much of Dio's fortune, she sought to finish this goal, enlisting her family to help, brute force if needed. Her grandfather was more than happy to take part. And with the use of a stand arrow, Garland gained the ability Twist Again. While now 109 years old and restricted to a wheelchair, the danger his stand poses is not to taken lightly.¬†

Now you run a ""security"" service. You contract with governments and major corporations. You consult, you train soldiers, police, and security officers, You send your own Defence contractors to work various roles for clients. Any free time you have is spent the MMA gym or shooting range. You have not let your guard down in at least a decade.

But somewhere along the way, you picked me up. I was the antithesis of everything to thought a man should be. I'm not big or strong or smart like you and your friends. When we were met, you weren't even sure I was male. I'm small, I'm pretty, I'm naive. And I'm the only thing in your life that helps you relax.

another day on earth,"There, I've lived another day on this timeline where I was caught.

I've told this story a hundred times. Some people decided they would take a dive in my private life, and they exposed my bad deeds to the community. This wouldn't have happened if only I had been nice to them. There were also weird things going on in my head at the time, because I was starting to take antipsychotics.

I keep imagining a different timeline. A timeline where I'd been careful and nice would be so much sweeter. A timeline where I'd stayed home instead of moving into that other place would be nice, too.

Basically, I was living in my hometown since the lockdown due to the pandemic started. Around eight months later, I moved to another place. In this place, I became the worst person I could possibly. After six months, I decided to seek psychiatric help. However, at this time, I was already a really shitty person, but I was not completely aware I was. When I was prescribed antipsychotics and was told that I might be bipolar, I decided to get drunk. After three days, I bought my meds and went home.

I want to strangle myself. There were two life changes there - starting my medication and going back home. I should have tried to take antipsychotics sooner, so I would know that it was the meds that were making me feel shitty, and not being back home. There was also no real reason to move to that other place. It just gave me access to alcohol and the freedom for more bad behaviour.

That was May.

In June, I got sick.

The people were mad at me, and then they did what they did.

I should not have gotten drunk.

I should have started medication as soon as possible.

I should have told my family about it sooner.

Now, I'm posting here, because after everything, I'm convinced I've been a narcissist to a degree. The conversations they've dug are so embarrassing. The weird ideas and the irrational anger may have come from the bipolar stuff, but I was hella self-centered, too. I realise most of my mistakes would not be so grave, if only I gave myself a minute to think about others. I just let myself be angry and sad and whatever, without giving much thought about how it affects others.

My hometown thinks I am an evil idiot now, and I'm still thinking of ways to live that down. Being seen as an idiot shouldn't be so bad, but I think I am not completely an idiot.

Someone else here told me I should embrace the hatred. I don't know how to find the strength to do that. I've been hiding here in our house for weeks, although I did take a walk a few days ago. I wish I just took a shower and took a walk whenever I was feeling terrible before this whole town started hating me, because it actually helps.

I can't believe I was a few decisions away from being not hated. I'm now looking forward to the end of this pandemic, so I can move back on campus and flee from this whole thing.

I was just about to recover. Something did plague me for years. I didn't want to feel sad, and yet I did. I had a good life, and if only I had begun medication sooner, I would have known there was a different way to live. Sometimes I wonder, though, if I had started medication sooner, would I know that I was being self-centered? Or would I just be a happier narcissist?

I keep mulling over these decisions. There's no way to turn back time, but I can't help but wonder what would have happened, if only I had chosen different things. It wouldn't be as bad as this one, I bet.",narcissism,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissism/comments/pansrk/another_day_on_earth/,,inmylucidmoments,pansrk,/r/narcissism/comments/pansrk/another_day_on_earth/,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissism/comments/pansrk/another_day_on_earth/,8,2021-08-24

[M4F] Personal Trainer to the Stars,"While I'm new to LA, I'm definitely not new to handling high class clients and discreet sessions. I've trained nearly a hundred individuals on their way to becoming the best they can be. Whether it's bulking up for a new movie, slimming down for a magazine, or something of a personal goal; I have the tools and the talents for anything you need. 

My rates and schedule can be discussed. Everything is very flexible. I have access to private gyms, my own personal home, and I can accommodate by showing up at your location, too. I've done sessions in the park or other irregular places. Everything is for your comfort and progress!

~ ~ ~ ~

I'm looking to take on new celebrity, Instagram, twitch, and online personality clientele as their personal trainer. Sweaty, sexy gym fun with the hottest women I can find! Maybe you want to be Miley Cyrus bulking up so she can compete in a bodybuilding competition? We can go as far as steroids and make her huge! Selena Gomez wants the tightest, fastest tummy for her next Puma shoot? Absolutely. June Lapine, Boxxy, or Gabbie Hannah looking to explode back into mainstream with a killer new body? Let's do it! 

I'm pretty limitless. Eighteen and older for characters, references, and writers, please. While I don't usually enjoy scat or piss, I could have some fun if a muscled celebrity and someone wrestled or boxed and something happened; broken bones, being punched in the gut so hard they vomit, piss, or shit themselves, and stuff like that can be enjoyable to a certain extent. Beyond that, no multiple males in any sexual scene, no genital mutilation, I don't want any abusive males, either. I'm totally fine being completely abused, but I don't want to play a character on the giving end of anything non-consentual.

Kinks would be handjobs, teasing, outfit play, sex toys, magic, super powers (especially super strong girls), growth, cumplay, lots of cum, multiple/premature/forced ejaculation, tickle play, femdom, condescending women, female superiority, footplay, wrestling, public and semi public. 

Favorite celebrities include Pokimane, Angelskimi, lilypichu, faellu, Angie Varona, Jessica Nigri, Miley Cyrus, Victoria Justice, Sarah Hyland, Elizabeth Gillies, Miranda Cosgrove, Debby Ryan, Jennette McCurdy, Cara Delevingne, Taylor Swift, Mia Khalifa, Rilee Marks, Dillon Harper, StPeach, Megan Fox, Lindsay Lohan, Masiela Lusha, Emily Osment, Dove Cameron, Peyton List, Scarlett Johanson, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, Lauren Boebert, Tomi Lahren and I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting.

An A**hole caused drama in a group and I lost a few close friends because of it.,"Sorry for any errors, first time writing and am using this as a throwaway account. So just to clarify things, this was all on a game, Rust to be specific. I (20M) play the game pretty regularly but going to college campus as put a hold on that as I want to be responsible. The story I am about to say is relevant as it involves our reasoning of why at the end. Anyways, before I get off topic, around the first week of August I was playing with some friends who were in a clan. I know, cringe thing to say haha. I was close friends with the leader as I have known him for about 2 years, the same amount of time as one of my other close friends who I trust a lot even though I never met the guy. Being bored, I invited two of my friends to join me with the clan, names will be changed for privacy of course, John (17m) and Jacob(18M). So wipe day happened, everything reset and people were joining servers, normal stuff really. There were about five of us in a discord call, myself and Jacob included. There were three people who I didn't know, the ""main one"" out of those we will call Richard(30M). I was a little late as my game didn't want to update so I spent about two hours in a queue but Jacob along with Richard and one other random were in the server getting a start going.

While I was waiting to get through the queue, I was watching videos and was muted as a way to give my team some clear comms. I could hear stuff was happening and Richard started to yell at everyone, trying to take charge while panicking at the same time. He did this a couple of times but I didn't say anything during this as I don't know what the situation was so I couldn't decide if he was in the right or wrong. Fast forward a few hours, after I get into the server along with a couple more people joining in, we are being door camped by a group and our base has traps so our temporary self-proclaimed leader said to open doors to bait them in. After nearly losing the base because the people were getting by our traps due to poor positioning, Richard started to yell at us for it. I did forget to mention, he yelled another time before this so this would make his third ""tantrum"" within several hours. I decided to yell back at him because we couldn't do much in that situation and it was his idea to let them attempt on going deep. He of course didn't like it and then tried to gaslight me by pretending that his outburst was hours ago and I had no reason to yell at him. Anyways, another hour later and he gets off which gives me and Jacob a sigh of relief as we couldn't take him much longer. (By the way, Richard also hogged all of the blueprints for weapons, armor and medical supplies. Those who play rust know how annoying what comes next.) So for the rest of the day, my friend and I decided to check out the new under water labs and run them for a little before we got off. That was day one of wipe, fast forward to day three since Richard didn't on the second day so there's no point on talking about what happened other than we needed to farm for blueprints since the only person who had them didn't get on.

On the third day, my other friend John was already on well before me as he pulled an all nighter. I gave him a warning about Richard and told him that he wouldn't get along with him. Most of the day went smoothly with three of us just relaxing, having fun and such. Shortly after lunch, Richard joined in and immediately started to bark orders. The main thing that stuck out was that we needed wood to keep the furnaces cooking materials so instead of going out himself, he told us to do it. When we didn't because we were dealing with highly geared guys at our front door, he started to yell at us to get wood while in the middle of the firefight. He then went out himself to get about 4k wood (Not a lot in the game) and brought it back before bragging to us about it while we were finishing up the fight. He then proceeded to grab the scrap that I had farmed on the second day (4-5k, those who play vanilla know that's a lot of scrap, especially if it was done by a solo.) and he used most of it to research whatever he wanted. He then got off shortly after, leaving my friends and I having to get more scrap so that we can learn the essentials as we had just fought people who might have the capability to raid us. I had been keeping count of how many times he yells at us as he is the only person in the group causing problems so I wanted something to talk to the leader about.

The last day we were on that server I would say is the most important day for all of this as this is when he got on the longest. So John again pulled an all nighter as he had monsters to drink and I went to eat breakfast with my father as I was leaving for college in a few days. My father had been helping me deal with the guy by giving me advice on what to say so that I have a moral high ground incase I needed to do something drastic. I was getting texts from John that he was losing it with Richard as they weren't getting along which is what I expected. I told him stuff like, ""deafen and watch videos until I get home"" or ""say calmly that if he continues to act like a toddler, I will server mute him for a while just so that he realizes how immature he is being."" I also forgot to mention that my friends are about 17-18 but Richard and the clan leader are around 30. So throughout the day, John and I have been doing our own thing as we always want to find something thrilling to do. Later in the day, Richard is yelling at us again for a stupid reason as usual but this time we fought back and I had to mute the guy. I never had to use the server admin powers before but I didn't want to hear the guy yelling at us while we were trying to get the stuff that he was asking for. After a little, he realized that I muted him and threatened to change codes so I told him that if he did I would ban him from the discord server and then tell the clan leader, who is also his irl friend, what he did. He then went on another tantrum as we yelled back at him. After realizing that he wasn't getting anywhere, he tried to play victim by claiming he has different mental disorders. We knew that he was lying about them as John has one of those disorders and I have a different one. The one we believe he did have was Bipolar, even though he didn't admit to it, as one moment he was fine then the next he was turning into the hulk. Then for some stupid reason, he decided to call us the N word which I recorded as the discord server doesn't allow racism. He then claimed he didn't like saying the word which made me ask him, ""Why say it then? If you don't like the word then you don't say it."" My friend then finally got on so that I could explain to him everything. I tried to be unbiased which is why I offered to show footage instead as that would give him everything he needed to know. He declined and spoke in private with the one guy. Instead of banning him, he decided to give Richard another chance. That night, we got offline raided which wasn't a surprise as we had angered a few groups.

I took a day of a break from rust, along with John and Jacob as we needed to relax. I was keeping an eye on the discord server to see if anyone was getting a start on the server we played on but there was nothing. Seeing how I had about two days before I left for college, John, Jacob, myself and a friend of Jacob all were planning to get on a server. Jacob was the first person on and he got the start/snowball going before the rest of us got on. In the afternoon, one of the guys from the clan who I was friends with wanted to join but I told him that Jacob wanted it to just be him, myself, and John.

His response: Oh so whatever he says goes

Me: Well he got the start so yes. You can ask him if you want but it isn't really my choice.

A few minutes later, I get a message from the clan leader saying stuff about me leaving the clan mid wipe. I gave him four reasons why we weren't playing and he then just assumed I either lied to him or the other guy.

I told him ""I didn't lie to either of you as it was Jacob's choice on who joins the group for this server which is what I told the guy. I told you the details of why I don't want to come back right now which is still not lying.""

Leader: I am on my last leg with Richard.

I didn't care that he was on the last leg with Richard as he gave John a panic attack for the first time since 2016 and him being on the last leg means that he still has the ability to cause another one to happen. I then was told that if I wasn't with the clan then I wasn't in the clan which I feel like is immature of him even though he constantly wants to pull the maturity card with younger people. However I could be wrong, am I being ridiculous or should I just brush it off and be glad that I got out of this? Any kind of advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.

Package refused by sender - but recipient did not refuse,"I sent a package to a friend, not commercial, just sending my friend some back home packaged foods.  I was tracking the package and it was out for delivery, then showed:

 **Returning to Sender**  
The package was refused by the receiver and will be returned to the sender. 

I tried contacting UPS once I saw this, but they said it was already being returned.  I spoke to the recipient, who lives in single family home, who confirmed no one refused this, and I double checked that the address matched the label. The only possible issue is this is his girlfriend's house, I addressed it to him, C/O his girlfriend - both of their names on the label.

I read elsewhere on this reddit this might happen if the package was damaged, but I just picked up my package from where I sent it, the box looked a little dented, but the contents were fine, there was nothing leaking (everything had been double bagged/taped).

Any reason why this happens?

Can I take action against my landlord for not fixing a leak?,"I've been living on the 2nd floor of a 3-floor building. It's an old row home in PA that was turned into apartments. I've lived here for a year and in that time there have been 4 major leaks in the kitchen, and a few times there were just a couple drops. The landlord checked it out the first time it happened, and said it was the upstairs toilet breaking. He fixed the toilet, but it has leaked 3 times since then, and every time it's when something happens to the toilet upstairs. He insists that it isn't the toilet itself but maybe the pipes, and it's too expensive to pull up the floors upstairs to check the pipes. No major damage has ever happened to my personal belongings, and he did reimburse me for food that was ruined and did a cosmetic repair on my ceiling, but I still don't think this should happen this many times.

I tried looking it up and I'm not sure what I can do, considering the problem is happening in the apartment upstairs. My boyfriend keeps telling me to just move out, but aside from this happening, the apartment is perfect for me especially in my budget. I'm just wondering if there's a way to make them HAVE to do the repairs? And if I do, will they probably terminate my lease since it's month-to-month?

[M4F] Taking revenge on your bully,"We all know the typical freshman bully from the university, right? Usually done by the dumber, and physically stronger peers. Sometime, it was by dumber and richer peers, who didn't use physical strength, but the wealth and influence of their parents to get things their way. Sometimes, it was the gossiping and manupulative type.

We all dreamt of taking revenge on them.
How would the bully feel after coming home, and seeing their everyday harassment victim making their mother (or sister/aunt/maid/etc...) squeal in delight by pounding her ass hard over the kitchen counter?

Who's the bully, and the mother anyway?   
- Gullible bimbo trophy wife, who doesn't know better than to solve everything by spreading her legs?   
- Divorced, compassionate lady with soft curves and a big heart, who actually finds him cute, and feels sorry for him?   
- Desperate single mother who boosts her self-esteem by sleeping with young guys?   
- Dominant woman, hating her husband and her kid just because the first is the cause for the other, willing to do almost anything just to piss them off?   
- Is she a slut who just can't refuse a fuck to the point she has no idea who the fathers of her kids are, and never uses any protection?

He provided me a home for 7 months but was also abusive *LONG*,"*WARNING LONG READ* 
You never know what people are dealing with behind closed doors. For years now, I‚Äôve been lying and crying and making excuses for a man that said he loved me and cared, but showed the exact opposite sentiments. We met on July 1, 2018, on his birthday. It went pretty well besides the expected awkwardness of meeting and talking to someone in person for the first time. We watched a night showing of  Jurassic park. After the movie ended, we stayed outside the theatre and talked for hours, probably until about 1am and we had been inseparable ever since. We talked for MONTHS. In fact we ‚Äútalked‚Äù for almost a year. 10 months to be exact. Because he told me he‚Äôd been hurt before, lied to and disregarded like he was nothing. He told me he always jumped into relationships and it never worked out for him that way, and he ALWAYS ended up hurt in the long run. So, he wanted to do things differently. I understood. I agreed. I had been hurt too and all I wanted was to show him that all of us females are not the same. I wanted to show him that true, genuine, love existed and that I was willing to give him that. And truthfully and selfishly, I hoped that maybe he could show me the same‚Ä¶ and he did.. for a while. So I waited for him to be ready, and for us to build a bond first. And we did. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I did get impatient with him at times, probably by month 3-4 of talking, I was ready. I wanted to be official. He still wasn‚Äôt. So although I was still waiting and being patient, yeah I did nag him a bit. I started to get concerned that maybe he was just in it for the sex because we acted like a couple from damn near the 1st or 2nd month of us talking on forward. We had sex. Went on dates. Talked on the phone all day and night and stayed asleep otp together, did homework on the phone together, gym memberships together, hung out whenever we possibly could. In my eyes, we basically were together, just didn‚Äôt have the title and I didn‚Äôt see the hold up. 

But then, he watched my life completely change before my eyes before we were even official. In December of 2018, my family and I were evicted from our home of 4 years due to my father‚Äôs gambling addiction, as some of you may already know. The electric bill hadn‚Äôt been paid for at least a month and a half but I still stayed there, no electricity, food, AC or anything.. I guess I was in denial of what was going on and I held on for as long as I could. I watched as my dad, my now ex boyfriend, and my brother carried all of my belongings down the stairs, emptying my home slowly but surely, taking the items to storage, to literally never be seen again. By January of 2019, I was officially homeless. I kept it a secret for a while. I slept at my grandparents when I could, but my grandparents housing 6 people in a two bedroom apartment wasn‚Äôt always feasible with how the lease was set up, only 2 adults could be on the lease and that was already my grandparents, and by this point I was 18. I was an adult. They leasing people let my siblings slide by, because they‚Äôre both still kids, but technically I wasn‚Äôt, even though I was still in high school at the time. I didn‚Äôt want my grandparents to lose their home too because of us, so sometimes I just had to find somewhere to sleep safely in my car. One of the first red flags popped up one of the nights I was able to spend the night at my grandparents. I was outside, talking to him on the phone when I was called a bitch  by him for the first time. He apologized immediately and that was that. I forgave him. Why wouldn‚Äôt I? It happens sometimes right? Girlfriends get called that sometimes when their S/O gets upset. It is what it is. By March of 2019, he found out what was going on and begged his mom to let me stay with them, and she did. I stayed with him and his family from March of 2019, until October of 2019. For that, I will forever be grateful and appreciative. He saw me literally going from having everything on the outside, a two parent household, a nice sports car, a home‚Ä¶ to literally having absolutely nothing but a few clothes from my closet and trauma. I graduated high school thanks to them, because I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to bouncing from sleeping in the car, and not even knowing where I would sleep or how I would eat or just simply survive. During the time period of me living with him, that‚Äôs probably when our bond got the strongest obviously. We slept in the same bed, in the same room, in the same house for months on end. It was great being able to do that with the person I loved, but I was always sad. Always. Because I knew the reason why I was there and it wasn‚Äôt by choice. My family was gone. Scattered everywhere. Mom was in the car, brother was with my mom in the car, or at a friends house, or at my grandparents. My sister was the same. My dad was in and out of motel rooms. I barely spoke to them. For me, I don‚Äôt know man. Like honestly I never knew there was a true problem in the family until it was too late. No it wasn‚Äôt perfect, but we always had each other. My dad had always been the one with his head on the swivel. I‚Äôd always been daddy‚Äôs little girl, and when this happened I was completely blindsided. One minute I had it all, and then POOF. I know it must‚Äôve been hard for him to deal with someone with my kind of trauma. My kind of pain. I will say he tried. We finally made it official on the day of my graduation, May 18, 2019. He used to hold me when I cried, he used to be so supportive, the thing is, it wasn‚Äôt always all bad with him. So for the times where it was bad, I always remembered the good because after all, I KNEW there was good in him because I saw it with my own eyes. I knew there was a point where he had genuine love and care for me because I saw it with my own eyes. 

However‚Ä¶. I also saw and heard more. I‚Äôd uncovered his anger. I realized that when he got angry, all bets were off. Sometimes, when I looked him in the eyes when he was angry I saw a completely different person. I heard a completely different person. Because that wasn‚Äôt him. That wasn‚Äôt the man I knew and fell in love with. And he agreed. It wasn‚Äôt him. He couldn‚Äôt help it. He didn‚Äôt know why he said the things he did, and he truly didn‚Äôt mean it. It was only to hurt me in that moment. And in those moments, I was a bitch, I was ugly, I was crossed eyed, nobody else wanted me, I was insecure, I was pathetic, I was worthless, I was useless, he did not love me, it was fuck me and he hated me and etc etc. I never had a rebuttal. There was a lot I could have said but I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him. I never wanted to hurt him. Most of the time I just defended myself but I never really threw shots back at him. He used everything he could against me. My family falling apart. My homelessness. My dads gambling addiction. Like I said, when he was angry.. absolutely nothing was off limits. He would say ANYTHING that he thought would cut me deep. I became desensitized to it after a while. Nothing he could say to me would hurt me anymore because I‚Äôd heard it all before but yet I still stayed.. because like I said, it wasn‚Äôt all bad and when it was good it was GREAT. I held on to the great days for dear life.There were days where I was the happiest of my life with him, we‚Äôd go out to dinner, we‚Äôd go to Dave and busters, funopolis, the movies‚Ä¶ anywhere and everywhere around the area. Hell it wasn‚Äôt just great days. We‚Äôd have great months at a time.. but that anger.. it always eventually showed. Slowly it changed from words to actions. He‚Äôd get mad and punch the dashboard of my car. He‚Äôd get mad and punch holes in my bedroom door. He‚Äôd get mad and he‚Äôd push me against the door and literally scream in my face, saying insulting things. He‚Äôd get mad and pin me down on the bed. I got head butted one time. He‚Äôs ripped my shirts out of anger. Ripped and broken the necklace he bought me multiple times out of anger. He‚Äôd gripped me hard enough to bruise out of anger. But he‚Äôs never punched, kicked or slapped me. I mean he still showed his love and compassion‚Ä¶ but I saw it dwindling before my eyes. He never cheated on me, but I did find a girl in his phone once, his ‚Äúbestie‚Äù, work girlfriend whatever you want to call it, while I was staying with him. From his very first job that I got him. I‚Äôd found messages of them telling each other that they loved each other, her saying things like ‚Äúoh you didn‚Äôt miss me?‚Äù And him saying things like ‚Äúoh yk I missed you.‚Äù They used to FaceTime eachother and all. He asked her to FaceTime him one time and she‚Äôd say things like ‚ÄúI would but I‚Äôm butt ass naked right now‚Äù and he‚Äôd responded with something like ‚Äúsheesh‚Äù instead of shutting that shit down. When I confronted him about it, he choked me then broke up with me because even though I found those messages, I shouldn‚Äôt of been searching through his phone in the first place, and that just shows him how much I didn‚Äôt trust him. Plus, she has a boyfriend, and I know this, so why am I tripping over a girl who has a whole boyfriend? Made it seem like I was crazy for being upset over what I saw because after all, it‚Äôs not like he ever fucked her. So, we ended up working that out and getting back together, and I told him to stop communicating with her twice, and he said he did when in actuality he just put her messages on DND around me. When I found out, once again, it was me. I was so insecure. I wouldn‚Äôt let him have female friends. I was overreacting. I needed to let it go. 

So anyways, October of 2019 rolled around, he got his first phone under his name and his mom was pissed and kicked both of us out. So, the first night, we slept in my car together, and the second, we stayed with his friends who I didn‚Äôt know at the time. While we were there, he promised me 
everything would be alright, and that I had him and that he was gonna stick beside me and we were gonna make it work and figure it out together. I immediately started applying for a second job and apartments, with both of our names and incomes on the leasing applications. However, the next morning rolled around, his mom called him and said he could come back home but I couldn‚Äôt come with him, and just like that, he was gone. He left me there at his friends house that I didn‚Äôt know and he went home, telling me that at the end of the day, he‚Äôs not ready for all of that responsibility. So I was scrambling to find somewhere ASAP and get another job because I had no 30 day warning, no nothing. One minute I had a home and the next minute I was homeless, once again. Luckily by the grace of god I was able to find and get into my apartment here very quickly. My move in day was November 1, 2019 and I had nothing but an air mattress and some clothes but at least I wasn‚Äôt homeless anymore. To maintain this place, for the longest I had to work two jobs. 6-2 or 3pm at one then 5-11pm at the other. Every. Single. Day. For months on end. With no help. I held up for almost a year before my body gave out on me. I was starting to have intense back pains that turned into back spasms at 20 years of age. I wasn‚Äôt sleeping right. I wasn‚Äôt eating right. And on top of all of that for a while, I was trying to go to college too at a Technical school  but I couldn‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôd requested off Wednesday and Friday mornings from my primary job so that I could go to class but those were also my only morning days off, so usually I would sleep instead because I mean I still had to be at Walmart in the afternoon. So eventually, I dropped out. So while all of this is going on, I was not only trying to maintain myself and my well being but his as well. I was always there for him. I helped teach him how to drive and when he learned I let him take my car any and everywhere. To school. To work. Anywhere. Sometimes I‚Äôd even let him drop me off at work so that he would have a ride. I got him his first job. And when he lost it, I held him down. Less dates started to be on him and more started to be on me until eventually, it got to a point where if I didn‚Äôt take HIM on a date, we didn‚Äôt have dates. It got to a point where I was paying for literally everything. All of our food, all of our dates, everything. Whenever he needed money, he always asked me and I always gave, even if I didn‚Äôt really have it. Hell, most of the time I didn‚Äôt. I was trying to maintain a whole car and apartment by myself but I always somehow made a way for him too. As of today, our last date together was June 27th, 2021 and before that it was February 15, 2021. Yes of course we had inside dates (Netflix and takeout) in between‚Ä¶ funded by me for the majority of the times. The one on June 27th was paid for by a gift card and the one of feb 15 was paid for by me. But yet when I bring things like this up , im unappreciative and I don‚Äôt enjoy the time we do spend around eachother even without dates involved. All I care about is money. The materialistic things. Gifts for him, no matter the occasion I went all out, Apple Watch , gold chain, tennis bracelet, expensive ass shoes, nike tracksuits and shorts, gaming headphones, beats headphones‚Ä¶ the whole 9 yards. For me though, I got sweaters and perfumes. A pair of Nike leggings. A Nike shirt. A hoodie. It went from a $50 perfume, to a $15 perfume‚Ä¶  to some lipgloss set from TT&amp;  below, to for my 21st birthday this year.. I got absolutely nothing. I didn‚Äôt get taken out. Not a card. Not a handwritten letter. Nothing. And I didn‚Äôt even trip. Because he didn‚Äôt have a job at the time, and it was okay because when he did get a job surely he would make it up to me right? Well now here we are, he‚Äôs now working two jobs, he has his own car, my birthday never got made up to me, and now that he‚Äôs working 2 jobs now he‚Äôs fine. He doesn‚Äôt need me. He‚Äôs focused on him and his life and making sure he‚Äôs in order. And he‚Äôs done with me. Because even after everything I did for him, and sacrificed and endured none of it matters apparently. He can‚Äôt deal with me. I annoy him. I cry too much. I complain too much. I‚Äôm not appreciative enough. And this isn‚Äôt even the half of what I‚Äôve done, what I‚Äôve dealt with, what I‚Äôve made excuses for. This is the mild version. Because if I exposed the whole truth, it wouldn‚Äôt be pretty and I don‚Äôt want to do him like that. 

So for 3 years straight, i‚Äôve either been around, been on the phone with, been texting this man every single day. And now just like that it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs over and he doesn‚Äôt even care. I come to his house crying like an idiot at 1am and he‚Äôs looking at me like I‚Äôm fucking retarded. No concern in his eyes. No love. No remorse. No nothing. And I‚Äôm left here feeling dumb for even staying as long as I did. I feel dumb for wanting him back. I feel dumb for crying and being so broken over this man who can clearly see me at his place distraught at 1am and the only thing he can thing to say is go home. So I don‚Äôt know. Now I‚Äôm here. Alone. Broken. Confused. Sad. Annoyed. Feeling like an idiot and I guess this post was just to vent‚Ä¶ but any input or advice or anything would be helpful. If you made it this far, thank you for at least reading it, even if you have nothing to say. 

Tldr: I stayed with and partially took care of a man for 2-3 years that provided a home to me for 7 months but also emotionally and physically abused me, never took me on dates or showed appreciation, no affection really besides sex, and now we‚Äôre over and I‚Äôm distraught and feel like a fucking idiot.",BreakUps,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/pacayb/he_provided_me_a_home_for_7_months_but_was_also/,,anon1613,pacayb,/r/BreakUps/comments/pacayb/he_provided_me_a_home_for_7_months_but_was_also/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/pacayb/he_provided_me_a_home_for_7_months_but_was_also/,0,2021-08-24

AITA for screaming at my mom three times in one day?,"(Note: Before I begin, I think I was the A in the situation. I want to know if I‚Äôm fundamentally an A as a person, if I‚Äôm capable of doing something so terrible as this. Also CW for abuse, domestic abuse, screaming ect. Also, this is going to be very long. it also doesn‚Äôt pain me in the best light and I‚Äôm okay with that because if anyone has any tips on how to regulate extreme feelings of loneliness and anger I would love some. Because I don‚Äôt want that to happen again. I‚Äôm also getting better at taking my Lexapro every night so that I don‚Äôt lash out due to anxiety and my mother has been very helpful with that. I don‚Äôt wanna be a hypocrite. I just want this all to stop. I don‚Äôt want to be the problem. I don‚Äôt want to be in a position where I can rightfully be compared to my dad. )

I‚Äôm a young adult living with my parents and my older sister. My dad is horribly abusive when he‚Äôs angry, which is rare but his overall treatment of me has been pretty terrible. He scowled at me from the sidelines at my soccer games when I tried to play my best but still struggled and wasn‚Äôt very good at all. He purposely would take naps at my aerial arts performances. My parents would fight the entire time on vacations from when I was 7-11, so badly that my sister and I would hide in a closet. When I was ten, my mother and father got into a screaming match so bad that my mom told me to pack all my stuff into a bag because we‚Äôre staying in a hotel for the night and maybe moving away and switching schools for my sister and I all together. Throughout all of entire elementary school, I hated going home after school because I was scared of what would happen, even though I was getting bullied relentlessly by my peers. In high school, my mom and I got into a fight, which almost resulted in them selling our dogs. He has driven us when he was angry, cutting people off at 80mph and I thought were gonna.. you know. All this happened when I was still a minor. And after the roadrage driving, I finally considered calling CPS but my mother told me not to, so I didn‚Äôt (this was about two years ago I think). My parents and I are still together, through all of this. When I was seven, I begged my mom to divorce my dad but that was then I didn‚Äôt know that things weren‚Äôt that simple. After every bad fight, things would deescalate and life would go on. We would walk on eggshells and that was that. I asked her why she chose to stay with him the last 31 (32 years next month). She said she would be heartbroken. Now that‚Äôs changed due to a subsequent incident with my dad that happened after all this, that I will not be going into, for the privacy of everyone involved but it was so bad that there was police involvement (which I don‚Äôt recall happening before).

I‚Äôve never believed I‚Äôve had two parents. I had a mom whose every rule I had to follow perfectly without question and then there was some guy who was kind of handy and did dishes, but other than that, was kind of just some dude who lived here. He taught me how to ride a bike, we went on some bike rides together when I was younger, he occasionally helped me with my math homework, and we ushered together at church every week, but he would get fed up with me pretty easily if I wasn‚Äôt doing something right. I got into a car accident a couple weeks ago and even though he acted like he was supportive he later threatened that he wouldn‚Äôt help me again if I confronted him about his actions again. 

 Even though we‚Äôre Catholic, my mom is the head of the house and that shocked all the other Catholic schoolkids I knew when I was younger. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with my mom being the head of the house but when I would go over to my friends‚Äô house, their house was filled with music, their parents had one room, and I actually seemed to love each other. The only time my house was ever filled with music was when my dad would blasted it to psychologically torture us. 

Flash forward to now. I‚Äôm in college, but I did my first year online (this past school year at home). And it has been rough, to say the least. I was able to finish the fall semester but during Spring semester with the increased difficulty of the classes, my undiagnosed learning issues left me able  to only complete one class (barely), drop two, and have to take out an incomplete on the fourth class. In April, I would be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and an anxiety disorder. It was March 4th of this year that I figured out that I wanted to take a leave of absence. That very same night, my dad banged on the wall of our kitchen, while my mom and I were in the other. It made the house shake so hard that I was about to open twitter because I thought it was an earthquake. But my mom knew immediately it was him. He had just broken his nearly 20 year streak of not doing something like that, (besides the usual dish-slamming, curse words, and soda bottle-throwing) once my sister and I were born (my parents were married almost nine years before my older sister was born and 12 years when I was born). He would do things even worse than this (that I can‚Äôt even go into) before my sister and I were born. Why did he bang on the wall? Because the refrigerator was smelling bad, he couldn‚Äôt figure out why, and my mom and I were having a discussion about how to move forward through my academic slump.

I have been lazy and unmotivated these past five months. I could have dug myself out of the whole but I didn‚Äôt. I guess my dad is right. I‚Äôm lazy, I don‚Äôt do anything, and I can‚Äôt put my phone down. And I would never say that anyone else in my circumstances was lazy if they couldn‚Äôt, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that way about myself. I‚Äôve had multiple breakdowns because I‚Äôve had to be in the same room as him. I know it might sound silly but I just keep flashing back to that night. I‚Äôve been pressured into having conversations with him. The day after my mom had me bring him up a sandwich to his room for lunch. I‚Äôve even gotten upset with my mom because I feel like there has been no accountability. I even have gotten upset with her because she tracks where I go, and even though she tracks my sister, my sister has always been freedom to go and do what she wants, without consequences being put into effect. (I don‚Äôt entirely feel that way anymore because I was failing college.) It was only recently that my sister stopped telling me that I needed to stop wanting to distance myself from my dad. And that I need to stop acting mentally ill because my mom was threatening to come back early with my dad for a trip just because I snapped at her. She was willing to feed her cat two hours later than he normally got fed because she said she didn‚Äôt want someone crazy like me around him. She made a point to walk by my room crying. Why? My sister still had an apartment at this point but my mom asked her to babysit me for the weekend (I am an adult). When my mom and I got into an argument over text I refused to answer her phone call because I needed time to calm down and so she dropped my sister into argument like I was still a child. She wouldn‚Äôt talk to me or apologize for weeks. I took a couple days to apologize to her. My sister was always out of the house when I was in high school and went off to in-person college years ago and graduated, and she had friends so she kind of stopped remembering how it feels like to have to put up with his wrath and couldn‚Äôt sympathize with me until she moved back in (which was in the last couple of months.) 

My mom has always said that if I don‚Äôt want to have a conversation and talk things out on her terms and when she‚Äôs ready, then I am immature.  My mom acted like she was doing me a favor by getting him out of the house for a weekend.

They know that for three months after March my dad stepped up his throwing of bottles and slamming of dishes, but only when I was around. When around my mom and my sister‚Äôs friends he‚Äôs perfectly pleasant, manipulatively so, but not around me or even my friends. A week ago, he got frustrated at my friends‚Äô parents and they had to calm down before sending him home. Even though my dad also treats them terribly, mom and sister were always aware of this fact.

I‚Äôm the only one in my family who doesn‚Äôt work. I wanted to work but I shattered that dream for myself by not finishing my missing assignments over the summer, according to my mom‚Äôs rules. 

There was one incident in late June where he threatened to leave the one instance when I didn‚Äôt want him to leave. It was a really bad situation and my mom wasn‚Äôt dealing it so I would have to deal with it, if things got worse. My mom said that he was just scared and I understand that, but I was scared too.

A week after that in early July, my mom, dad and I, along with my friend and her three family members went on vacation and rented a big house together. my sister and someone else were supposed to go but due to unforeseen circumstances, it was just going to be my mom, my dad, my friend, and myself. I told my mom that I was not comfortable with that. my mom was upset that I wanted to change the plans last minute, but I had only found out that my sister and her +1, weren‚Äôt coming, the day before. So with two days before the trip I couldn‚Äôt take a staying here and I ran off to that same friend‚Äôs house and I told them everything. While I was gone, my mom and dad had an argument. My dad was trying to say that it‚Äôs only me who thinks that he has been way out of line for a long long time and that I only dislike him because of his politics. His politics are mainly racism which affects 2 out of my 3 friends, and is the reason I will never bring them over here to hang out, as long as he‚Äôs still living here. On my way to my friends house, my mom threatened to come and get me and bring me home. She did stick up for me to him, but I did not appreciate being controlled like this. I just wanted one night away from the chaos. 

I stayed there for 24 hours and then two days later was when we left to go on the trip.  my friend‚Äôs parents and sister decided that they wanted to go at the last minute so I was okay with going on the trip and this is why I still went, even though I didn‚Äôt want to go.

The first day of the trip was my dad‚Äòs 62nd birthday. I didn‚Äôt want to go to the dinner because it killed me seeing everyone being so nice to him, not like he doesn‚Äôt deserve anything but it was just too soon for me to be at a celebration of his existence when his existence is only really ever brought me pain, extreme pain. It was only almost four months after the March 4th incident. My mom told me not to spoil the dinner with my sadness, as everyone toasted to his life. My friend and her sister distracted me and it was okay. 

My friend‚Äôs dad, my friend‚Äôs sister, and my dad left after a few days, as scheduled. And so it was just my friend, my friends‚Äôs mom my mom, and I. Skipping forward to the end of the trip, my dad and sister were home and my sister‚Äòs brand new car that they had bought her was having issues, issues that made her have to use my car on and off for weeks after. When my mom is away everything at the house falls apart, and the same had happened in late May. He had put off calling a tire repair service and it was just a disaster. I was tired of the bullshit so I called him incompetent and I shouldn‚Äôt have let all my pent up feelings towards him boil over. I started going on and on about how I hated hearing his name how and I hated every mention of him. And my mom told me not to speak of her husband that way (That was before I remember to tell her that he was talking shit about her to his friends across the country on the phone. I should‚Äôve remembered to tell her earlier. It has been going on for months maybe years at this point, I don‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt remember to tell her.) 

I shouldn‚Äôt have continued to get frustrated with her when she would give confusing directions to my friend and I. because of that she yelled at me in front of my friend and I ran up to my room. My door at the vacation house didn‚Äôt lock so all of three of them were coming into my room and trying to get me to talk to them right away. It was embarrassing. The following day when we were to go home, my mom and I met my friend and her mom at a farmer‚Äôs market before heading home in our separate family cars. It was hot and I didn‚Äôt really feel like talking and my mom said that I was ruining the trip. I had refused to go to the last dinner of the trip the night before because I didn‚Äôt wanna ruin it. Her concerns were valid but I was nonverbal and she yelled at me in public in front of people saying that we were going to stand there in the heat until I said something. She said if I don‚Äôt start being happy then will leave my friends early and start the four hour trip home and we did because I failed. 

Before leaving, she said that she was so upset that I wasn‚Äôt telling her what was wrong right then that she implied she was at a higher risk of crashing the car. 

That night, I broke down crying for an hour and told her all of this. I didn‚Äôt mean to trauma dump but I didn‚Äôt really think I should have had to explain some of this to her. She was really understanding and willing to listen, but some of it didn‚Äôt stick. I did say some horrible things, like only wanting to use my parents as an ATM machine, which she understandably took badly. What I meant by that was I couldn‚Äôt stand the thought of having to come back here for breaks and holidays once I went off to college. I was at my worst here, before it got worse.

And to those who might wonder why I didn‚Äôt say no, even though I was an adult. My mom can track my phone. She could call and get my car taken away or tell someone else in my family that they can use it, without my consent because it‚Äôs not my car because I don‚Äôt pay for it. She was telling my friend‚Äôs parents that I couldn‚Äôt go see them at one point.

Throughout late July and mid August, I saw a writing tutor that mom agreed to pay about 2,000 in total for. That sounds like a lot ($240 dollars for 3 days a week) and it was because I didn‚Äôt end up finishing a single essay. But I was finally getting close. She said that she was paying for two tutors and a therapist and I still hadn‚Äôt turned anything in so she didn‚Äôt want me seeing my tutors anymore. That makes sense to me now. I just don‚Äôt like the awkward position she put me in, having me terminate these relationships before we originally agreed. At the time, a week ago, I didn‚Äôt want to stop working though.

So I yelled at her. Once. I would go to apologize. I did it again. I decided to not try again to apologize because I needed more time and didn‚Äôt want to make things worse so I started doing my makeup to calm down. She said put that down right now and come to my room. And then I screamed at her again. Some of the things we had just gotten our wires crossed about (Like my writing tutor because my therapist had told my mom that my priority should be getting ready to move into in-person college on August 30th and my mental health. My mom took that as switching gears and not allowing me to work on missing work at all even though my therapist clarified with me that she thinks I should still slowly work on it. There was an incident where my mom wanted me to do all the communication with the writing tutor because she viewed her as a stranger and I understand that but we are fairly familiar with the professor at my university who recommended her to us. I was willing to do the communication but my writing tutor wanted to communicate with my mother since she was the one who had the means to pay. my mom wanted me to communicate with her because I was an adult and I understood that but that‚Äôs not what my writing tutor wanted. my mom assumed that my writing tutor had a physical business address to mail checks to but that was why my writing tutor wanted to talk and give her options and then I would put in the information that was needed to make that happen. I gave my writing tutor my mom‚Äòs phone number and email because my writing tutor wanted to reach out to her since my mom wasn‚Äôt paying her on time . My mom hadn‚Äôt paid her for the last week and a new week was coming up and so my writing tutor texted and called my mom and said that she couldn‚Äôt keep working with me if we didn‚Äôt pay her by Monday. my mom said that she was being threatened and so my therapist said that my mom just didn‚Äôt like my writing tutor because she felt disrespected. But as stated above there were also other reasons that came about later as to why my mom didn‚Äôt want me working with her anymore.) But I also felt lied on. She said that I wanted to break our family apart and that I wished financial ruin on the family. She said that she would have to pay him a lot of money because of the community property state we live in and that we can‚Äôt afford to do that. She had already told me this and I already said that I understood and that I just wanted something to change because I couldn‚Äôt keep living with his abuse anymore. When I told her that I am affected by what goes on here and that that affect my ability to work she said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think I‚Äôm affected by his behavior too?‚Äù. But I was completely out of line I should‚Äôve screamed at her. I shouldn‚Äôt have implied that she was old yet still acting like a child because she‚Äôs not old and it was agest of me to say that. I don‚Äôt really remember a lot of what we went back-and-forth about even though it was just a week ago. I just remember screaming so loud it‚Äôs so hard that my throat hurt and that I made my dog shake with fear. I‚Äôm surprised she let me out of the house to go to my friends house. And we did apologize and following the subsequent incident with my dad that night that led to police involvement, our relationship is doing better because we finally understand each other. I just wish it hadn‚Äôt to come to that.  

She had said that I was acting like my dad and she was right. I told her I didn‚Äôt want to be compared to him. My therapist says she shouldn‚Äôt have said that because I‚Äôve actually showed remorse whereas my dad blames us for his behavior. But like I said our relationship is doing better now, now that she understands the pain I‚Äôve been dealing with and now that my sister and her have finally recognized they don‚Äôt have to put up with this. They never have. We never have. 

I don‚Äôt even know what possessed me to do that. Like what gave me the thought that I had the right to do that? I just felt like I was going crazy. I was crying a river and felt like I was falling down whole and that it would never stop. I‚Äôve mentioned to her that I‚Äôve talked to other people about what goes on here because I just felt like I was going insane when I tried to talk to my parents about it. It‚Äôs like trying to confront Gabbie Hanna like nothing will come out of it. I know I was completely out of line. And even though an incident with my dad what happened later that night that would confirm all my frustrations about not being listened to, I was still the A. My mom has always said that she couldn‚Äôt leave him because he was mentally ill and that he was her husband and even though he wasn‚Äôt fulfilling his responsibility to take care of his mental health, he was still her responsibility (She doesn‚Äôt think this now btw). I would respond by saying I mentally ill to and I don‚Äôt act that way. I would respond by saying I mentally ill to and I don‚Äôt act that way. But then I did. I became a hypocrite. I saw the fear in her eyes, my dog‚Äôs eyes. I was just.like.him. And I‚Äôm having a hard time moving on. I‚Äôm starting to believe that I‚Äôm a permanent A and not just an A then. I‚Äôm just still so shocked that I did that. I‚Äôve never done something like that before. I just want to go off to college and be genuinely happy for once in my life I‚Äôm not being a dangerous situation for once, but I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve that. I just want to move on but I can‚Äôt. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck forever being a traumatized little kid who now has the responsibilities of adult. I just don‚Äôt want to have another break down and not be able to complete my classes and then flunk out of college and I‚Äôm just scared and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just don‚Äôt wanna prove him right like I already am. My mom and my sister have forgiven me but I don‚Äôt know how to forgive myself.",u_Head-Home1259,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Head-Home1259/comments/paccff/aita_for_screaming_at_my_mom_three_times_in_one/,,Head-Home1259,paccff,/r/u_Head-Home1259/comments/paccff/aita_for_screaming_at_my_mom_three_times_in_one/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Head-Home1259/comments/paccff/aita_for_screaming_at_my_mom_three_times_in_one/,0,2021-08-24

"My experience with an abusive, entitled housemate. (Warning, Long Horror story)","I'm not entirely sure if this fits the criteria, however, there's an experience I feel like I need to share in order to gain some closure on it.   


Going forward is going to be very heavy, and this is going to be a rather long, slow burn. Trigger warnings for abuse, suicidal idealization, and self harm.   


Bit of background on the situation; My dad is a Gulf War veteran, and the kind of stuff he's experienced... I cannot even fathom. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, something triggered him hard, and it wound up hospitalizing him for a little bit due to a mental breakdown where he received a diagnosis for PTSD(Post Traumatic Stress Disorder).   


One thing about my dad, is he's the kind of person who would rather put everyone else before himself, to an unhealthy degree, and well, sometimes he expected us to do the same(Holds some relevance for later.)   


Here's where the story starts; When I was in fourth or fifth grade, my dad approached me and asked how comfortable I would be with them allowing someone to stay with us for a bit until they got back on their feet. My dad had made a friend online who had lost their home and had just exited the hospital( I later learned this was because they had tried to kill themself) and needed somewhere to stay.   


Of course, I was like Ten at the time and had no clue what was going on, and I thought I'd be helping if I said yes, and this is how J came into our lives.   


J moved in, taking my room, and my brother and I then moved out into the room that was previously a storage room. Things were okay for a while, J had seemed nice, and she had offered help in the form of yard work as she was staying rent free.   


A couple months come and go, and we're asked about if we'd be okay if J stayed with us for a little longer. My brother and I agreed, and my sister, who was 6 at the time agreed too, wanting to be included. The vote was unanimous, and we had unknowingly, at the ages of 10, 8 and 6 signed a contract with the devil.   


It started small-- our room had a TV in it, and the speakers were particularly weak, so we'd have to pump it up a little bit in order to hear it. Here's the issue in that-- J had incredibly sensitive ears. If we turned the TV up past volume level 9, she'd come out and ask us to turn it down.   


Soon enough this became a pattern. we'd be unable to hear the TV, turn it up, and then be told to turn it down. The pattern started to persist outside of that though, to our playing. We play too loud? We get yelled at.   


Soon she decided to take it upon herself to start punishing us, which my parents sometimes supported and sometimes didn't. She'd take our remote from us and turn the TV off, hiding it in her room. she'd steal our game systems, because we were too loud. I know how this sounds, me bitching about being slighted as a child, but just follow me on this.   


Fast-forward three years later, J is still there. I'm an asshole teenager, and I don't like her at all. I'm not a good person, and yeah, I admit, I deserved to be knocked down a peg or two, but by my parents, not her. I got enough shit from my parents, and I didn't need it from her as well. At this point, my parents have totally bought into her, as she's taking care of the yard, the house, and saving our asses when we need it-- still not paying rent by the way, and now un-employed.   


Sometimes my parents would go out on date nights, leaving her to babysit for them, and that's where I personally saw my first red flag-- Something happened out in the living room where my sister was and I walk out to see her and my eight-year-old sister fighting. My sister turns around to try and ignore her, and.... She picks up a bowl and throws it at her, hard. It doesn't hit her, but it bounces and lands face-down. At that point I intervene and say ""I'm going to tell mom and dad about that."" And the words she utters next I remember clearly:  


""No you won't, you're a pussy. They'd never believe you anyways.""  


And she was right. They didn't. Because by this point, I was the asshole trouble teenager who self-harmed for attention, had shit friends, and an even shittier attitude. In fact, they never believed me, and she rooted herself even further into the household.   


Another incident I remember was over a pizza at dinner. I took a couple extra slices before she showed up, and ate them, and there was only a few slices left for her. She threw a fit, claimed she got no respect, stated that she was moving out, and she'll live on the streets, shut herself in her room and started packing, and wouldn't stop until I came to her room and honestly and sincerely apologized.   


Over the next decade, she had fights on several occasions with both my mom and dad. My mom for a couple months over HER calling MY MOTHER a terrible parent (She's not, however, she's very old fashioned and flawed in a few ways due to her OWN parents manipulation and abuse).   


My DAD however, was ignored for an entire year. The only thing I recall is her calling him a ""fucking pussy"", an insult she loved to hurl at all of us. That stopped when he threatened to throw her out over it. 

Fast forward to college-- She has my entire family brainwashed, and she had been in the household for 10 years at this point, never paying rent, and never really giving back anything meaningful to our family. My brother and sister are on the same page as me at this point, but are far too afraid to say anything, because of almost a Decade of emotional, verbal, and sometimes physical abuse and manipulation.   


I had a particularly bad summer where I fell into a friendship that was just. Bad for both of us, and I damn near killed myself over it because I took on all of that friends problems and when they cut me out of their life, I just completely imploded. For the next year, I was physically, mentally, and emotionally broken, and I had to learn how to be selfish after trying to fix other people and take on problems that weren't mine to deal with, the complete opposite of what I was taught growing up. It's through this that, that I realized that I couldn't do this anymore. I couldn't feed J's manipulation.   


I was being driven to work by my dad when I decided to say it. ""Dad. I can't do this anymore. I think J is abusive, and here are the things she has done.""  


That night, my mom and dad had a talk, and.. J did this thing where she would always sit at the very bottom of the steps and listen in on any conversation that was being held up there. She heard it. Next morning as I'm waking up making my cup of coffee, she approaches me, and this is how that went:  


J: ""How am I abusive?""  


Me: \*No reaction or response, I keep making my coffee, knowing that my words will be twisted and I'll be unable to form a proper response\*  


J: ""Hey Fuckwad!""  


me: \*No response\*  


J: \*Grabs me, spins me around and gets in my face\* ""How am I abusive?""  


And it continues like that until she sees fit to dress me down and walk away, my mom having watched the entire thing. She fills me in that she overheard their conversation, and that ""She just wanted to open a dialogue with me"".   


The moment I remember the most however, was the moment that made me drop out of school, turn around, and hide in my room for a long time.   


I was reheating some leftovers while my mom's watching TV and she's out there spewing some bullshit out of her mouth about how I messed something up yet again and she leaves walking down the stairs saying ""You're just a fuck up."" These words... have been repeated to me constantly over the last TEN years. They're words that still ring in my head to this day. I didn't think, I only reacted. Ten years of pure rage called back and screamed at her ""YOU'RE THE FUCK UP!""  


I don't remember what happened after that. The only thing I remember is her reaching for the knife rack, and handing the butt of a knife to me and while daring me to kill her.   


I fell apart after that. I was shivering and shaking, and telling my mom it's her or me. I was begging her to make her leave, I don't care where she goes.   


I wish I could say that she was thrown out, but the story doesn't end there. The way J had handled situations like this in the past were she'd apologize to my parents. Not me, my parents. and ensure it would never happen again. It always happened again, and this time was no different.   


I harbored serious resentment for my parents at that point, and I was vocal about it to all my friends in Skype groups and chats. I was also seriously suicidal, and self harming on a near daily basis. One of my friends took one of my darker jokes as fact and called the cops (By the way, if someone is suicidal, and you aren't 100% certain they're in serious danger and they're not joking, DON'T do this. You can seriously do more harm then good).   


I was forced to a hospital, and the cops went through everything. All my conversations. My parents saw all of it, and did not like it, one bit. They even showed J the chat logs, and now she had the means to shut me up for good. My parents cut all support for me after seeing me trash them, and J burrowed even deeper into their heads. At one point, she pinned me to the wall, choked me out while screaming at me about how I'll never amount to anything, and how I'll always be a fuck up and I'll always be a loser, and screams at me ""Shut up you pussy, my hands are nowhere near your throat!"" as she moves her hands to my shoulders while my parents round the corner.   


She was manipulative. She knew EXACTLY what she was doing. All she ever did was project her mistakes, her trauma, and her self-hatred onto me.   


Eventually, I don't know how it happened, but my Dad woke up. He wormed his way out of her brainwashing and gave her a year to leave, and that was two years ago, and while I'm upset that it took him being hurt by J to make the decision after years of being hurt and hiding in my room trying to avoid her, 

She destroyed our family and our interpersonal relationships. My relationship with my parents will never be what it used to be, all because she was in our lives.While some fault lays on my parents and while I'm upset that it took him being hurt by J to make the decision after years of being hurt and hiding in my room trying to avoid her, I can't blame them entirely. The best manipulators know how to warp your mind without you ever knowing that's what happened.

Wild speculation about Spider-Man No Way Home,"Spoilers maybe???

So the trailer just dropped for the movie and after watching it I have concerns but I'm sure they'll do great.  My biggest concern is that they seem to be borrowing from 'One More Day' which if you haven't read it, don't.  It is universally agreed to be one of the worst story lines ever done.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick summary; Spider-Man's outs himself, Aunt May gets shot, he realizes that it was a mistake and trades his marriage to the devil to save his aunt and get back is anomominity. It's terrible and just a lazy excuse for them to go back to telling stories about a single and down on his luck Peter Parker.

&amp;#x200B;

So that being said I have my concerns.  But then I thought about it and after watching the trailer for the second time the wink that Strange gives after Wong leaves didn't sit right with me.  What if they are doing One More Day.  What if that isn't Strange but (cue the WandaVision theories) its Mephesto???  That's why we didn't see him in WandaVision because they were saving him for the big screen.",FanTheories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/paf4gf/wild_speculation_about_spiderman_no_way_home/,Marvel/DC,Zaius_MD,paf4gf,/r/FanTheories/comments/paf4gf/wild_speculation_about_spiderman_no_way_home/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/paf4gf/wild_speculation_about_spiderman_no_way_home/,0,2021-08-24

32 M looking for F for [Friendship],"Welp. Never thought making a friend would be so difficult. Then you get older and life takes a literal crap on you. So here I am, on the internets, in search of the elusive friend. I would much prefer someone local (South Carolina), but not a requirement. As if anyone actually lives here anyway. üôÑ

I decided to be part of the cool kids crowd and took one of those fancy personality tests. Scored an INTP-T. Internet says I can be a difficult personality to get a long with. I am in agreement. I'm shy, extremely introverted (until you get to know me), a home body. I hate having to leave the house unless it's absolutely necessary. To round out this lovely little package, I was gifted social anxiety with no gift receipt. Also, I am unemployed and live with family. Judge me as you see fit. 

That's a short list of issues you'd be signing up to deal with. The long list will be revealed along the way.

I don't watch a lot of movies/shows. When I do, it's typically something I've already watched. Multiple times. Favorite genre to watch is scifi, with Stargate being my favorite series most of all. Love video games. Play said video games on PC. Love to build computers when I can. Some basic nerd stuff.

My taste in music ranges from classic rock to death metal/thrasher. I don't like country. Johnny Cash excluded. I'll indulge in the occasional wub once in a while, but metal is probably my go-to genre.

That's about all I can think to stuff in here. I'm looking for an actual friendship, please. None of that ghosting after a couple days crap. I laid out how I am to alleviate that. If you don't like what you read, then please don't waste my time.

Last, but not least, the 'f' in the title doesn't pertain only to cis. F is f.",MeetPeople,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetPeople/comments/paf8k8/32_m_looking_for_f_for_friendship/,Just Friends,pyrojester009,paf8k8,/r/MeetPeople/comments/paf8k8/32_m_looking_for_f_for_friendship/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetPeople/comments/paf8k8/32_m_looking_for_f_for_friendship/,0,2021-08-24

I am trying my best but I often crash,"I am doing so much everyday to make myself happier but I can‚Äôt help it when I crash suddenly for some reason that I can‚Äôt understand. I start to feel wildly anxious and uncomfortable when I have no reason to be then all the things I did to feel happier don‚Äôt work because I am now wildly uncomfortable and anxious. I tell myself really kind and loving things but it doesn‚Äôt work as well as I‚Äôd like it to. People around me notice from my eyes that I look shy and uncomfortable. I hate it. I don‚Äôt know what to doooooo. Hooowww can I make this stop it‚Äôs been giving me unwanted suicidal thoughts.

I need help from somebody. I don‚Äôt know what I can do anymore. I don‚Äôt have any reason to feel this way! I am on vacation in a place I love. I have money I can spend doing anything I want. I have the social skills to socialise with people (ofc when I suddenly feel wildly uncomfortable all my social skills go away!)

I am really smart (at least I think so you knoowww), my future looks bright (I mean that‚Äôs only if I can solve this issue!) idk what to do! I don‚Äôt wanna start trying out things like smoking and drugs. I don‚Äôt wanna start going to red light districts and pay for orgasms. I wanna be at home with somebody or multiple people feeling happy and without this poison in me.

I‚Äôm even good looking according to multiple people and myself included. My self esteem is high (at least I think it is). 

This is my cry for help. I have many friends but they‚Äôd have no idea what to do about this. Can someone leave me a nice comment or tell me something inspiring or even help me understand myself? I am fighting this unseen battle within myself and I‚Äôm desperately trying not to start any bad habits.


This way I‚Äôm feeling can be really dangerous! Last night I went to a red light district at 2 am completely alone (approx. 30 min walk) just so I could see those neon lights. I didn‚Äôt wanna pay for anything I just wanted to see.

I ended up feeling terrified because I was approached by some people who don‚Äôt look really nice (this was at 3 am btw!) I did my best to avoid them which really annoyed them and one guy was a bit loud about it and that made me nearly sprint back home. The rest of the way home I speed walked as fast as I could until I saw a police car which just made me feel safe and ok with walking normally.

I am convinced that if my mental health doesn‚Äôt improve I will end up being a victim of some crime.

I don‚Äôt physically harm myself and all my thoughts(at least 99% of them) are positive and loving. I am underweight because I barely eat because I never feel like it. I am trying my best to love myself and give myself the proper care that I wasn‚Äôt given. This is incredibly difficult. I do my best to deal with every negative thought appropriately and show myself a more positive way to think about things.

I love myself very much and I don‚Äôt want to feel this way. I‚Äôve seen myself over the years and I deserve much more happiness than this.

I stutter a lot and I don‚Äôt really know why. I can speak by myself to myself in an empty room and not stutter but in front of others i stutter a lot. I have SOOO many nice and smart thoughts but instead of letting people hear them and understand me and who I am they hear my terrible stutter and start to think of me as a dumb person. I can speak 3 languages well (English is not my native language and is very different from my native language). Two I learned since I was a baby and the third I started learning very recently and I am absolutely in love with this language and learning it. I spent so much time perfecting my accent and people say that it‚Äôs really good and that soon I‚Äôll be able to sound like a native speaker. My accent actually amazes some people and that‚Äôs something that really makes me happy as learning this language is my passion. 

Now this stutter makes everything so much harder for me!! I want to be a social butterfly but I am terrified of stuttering and I do often stutter and mess up really nice opportunities I get to express myself and form connections. I have so many nice ideas and things to say but this stutter literally makes me mute and at times I could consider myself as someone who is literally not able to speak.

I hate this so endlessly because I know if I can just fix this I would live a life infinitely more happier. I feel like I have written more about my stutter than the other issues I have.

This is literally the bane of my existence. Okay sure this helped me not say really dumb things as a kid but now I‚Äôm more mature and not a kid! I know what I shouldn‚Äôt say and what I should.

I feel like if I could fix this stutter I could fix all my other problems.

I have no idea what to do. This is my cry for help. Someone please help me. I am a human I can at least get some nice comments. I‚Äôm not sure why I feel the need to justify this.

I never wanted to beg but I‚Äôve been struggling for so long now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have a counsellor but it‚Äôs hard to open up and I don‚Äôt know what to do to get myself to open up fully.

The thought of what my life could be without my stutter fills me up with so so so so much hope that I am able to bear feeling this sometimes seemingly unbearable depression. It‚Äôs not a nice way to live but with hope I have this fire in me that helps me feel warm during cold nights when I am alone.

I was once really really really tempted to attempt suicide but now with every ounce of my being I fight to never be anywhere near that point but instead heading further and further away from it with each second that passes.

I am doing a lot for myself but I really need some nice comments now.",depression,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pbmo33/i_am_trying_my_best_but_i_often_crash/,,throwawayy990012,pbmo33,/r/depression/comments/pbmo33/i_am_trying_my_best_but_i_often_crash/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pbmo33/i_am_trying_my_best_but_i_often_crash/,1,2021-08-25
Have you heard of Havana syndrome?,"A simple google search of it will send you down the rabbit hole. Half of what you‚Äôll find is fair speculation. The other is misinformation put there by mainly by the U.S. government. But the gist of what you‚Äôll get from popular media is that starting in 2016, a mysterious illness began affecting U.S. diplomats stationed in Havana. The symptoms were bizarre. Migraines. Seizures. Nausea. The cause is still not public. But it's really not an illness at all. Not as we know them. 

Most consensuses pointed towards sonic warfare. And that the Chinese or Russians were using high frequency noises not even perceptible to our ears, to attack personal. That was the most logical explanation. The most terrestrial.  

My buddy in intelligence told me the CIA commissioned a couple guys to write a book to say that insect calls were behind the syndrome. Yes, in classic government fashion they tried to convince the public that grasshoppers were really behind migraines and madness that seemed to only target our diplomats. Well, unfortunately hypochondria is not behind the syndrome, nor are bugs. 

I‚Äôve done a lot of thinking about whether I should tell this tale and not because some clich√© of ‚Äúmy life and that of my family‚Äôs will be in danger.‚Äù This is the story of the most spectacular government fuck up of all-time. So bad, that they‚Äôre hoping the world is destroyed before this leak becomes more mainstream. If anything, I‚Äôm here because everyone deserves to know what is behind their approaching fate. 

There‚Äôs a protocol in the highest level of the U.S. Government. One that‚Äôs almost a philosophy to some at the top of the food chain. It‚Äôs not taught at orientation for any intelligence agency nor are there more than a few dozen employed at once who are made aware of its existence. 

It‚Äôs called LIBB Law, though in reality it‚Äôs a protocol, not legislation. The phrase literally stands for ‚ÄúLet Ignorance Be Bliss.‚Äù 

Take for instance that you‚Äôre a NASA scientist, and you discover a distant star has gone supernova and the radiation that is heading towards earth is going to wipe out humanity in just 10 days. You call your superior and about as soon as you hang up, you‚Äôd get a call. You‚Äôd be told that if you attempt to share that information with the outside world, you‚Äôll spend those last 10 days alone in a cage. 

In short, the United States and any world government with the resources to discover a sudden and unpreventable apocalypse won‚Äôt reveal it to the public. And they will take whatever lengths possible to do so. 

So, one day you‚Äôd be stuck in traffic or pulling weeds, or pulling out if you‚Äôre lucky, and boom, you‚Äôll be evaporated in a firestorm from outer space. 

You wouldn‚Äôt have the chance to make up with your father or ex-girlfriend without knowing that your days were numbered. Nor would you be able take your last week on earth off from work to actually live. But you also won‚Äôt have to worry about the rioting and pillaging that would surely follow a public revelation of the end of the world. 

There‚Äôs an ethical argument here and like many laws in the United States LIBB law was created under the guise of morality. It states that it‚Äôs imperative to keep people calm in an extinction event, and that ignorance in the face of certain annihilation, is bliss. Whether you believe this or not is irrelevant. LIBB law exists so that the government can move all of its most vital personal into bunkers scattered throughout the states without the hinderance of societal collapse. 

I‚Äôm sharing this with you partly because I have the benefit of posting this on an internet forum where the world is ending every and any day. Don‚Äôt believe me or do. I don‚Äôt care. They can put me in a box for these last few weeks or months. I just hope this makes you live your life the way you wanted to if you knew it was going to end.

LIBB protocol was enacted on Friday August 20th, 2021. That is perhaps the second most consequential date in humanities existence, losing out only to the day we‚Äôre actually wiped out, and hardly anyone will ever know it. 

This story, the end of the world, starts in 2016 with the first case of the syndrome. I was in Jakarta, originally as counselor to Ambassador Robert Blake and later to his replacement Joe appointed by the Trump administration. This was no small post. Although often glanced over Indonesia is the 4th most populated country in the world with a population of 270 million people. 

I spent 10 years in the Department of Defense before spending the last 15 with The State Department as a diplomat. The foreign service life isn‚Äôt as glamourous as the title implies. There remains some romantic notion that diplomats attend embassy balls, smoke cigars, and drink brandy in rooms lined in mahogany where they broker deals to better their nations. Perhaps this was how it was seventy years ago apart from the latter. 

But in reality, I do paperwork. Then typically more paperwork. Perhaps if I‚Äôm lucky I won‚Äôt have to redo my first batch. I was by and large an international bureaucrat, working 70-hour weeks, whose kids blamed (rightfully) for the fact that they haven‚Äôt maintained a friendship for longer than a few years. Overworked and underpaid, at least I could tell people I was a diplomat. And with that old world notion their eyes would widen with admiration. 

In June of 2016 we were gathered in the media room for a private briefing on a mysterious illness afflicting our diplomats at the embassy in Havana. We had already heard the rumors. Our envoys to Cuba were said to be experiencing nosebleeds, migraines, seizures. Perfectly healthy Foreign Service Officers, some of which we knew personally, were deathly sick with no answer as to why. 

‚ÄúRussia. China.‚Äù These countries were not so much whispered but blurted out among us. The room stirred in an anxious chatter and questions begin to erupt. The Colonel set to brief us quieted us like a teacher would a class. 

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù We went silent. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have those answers. A full investigation is under away. If you haven‚Äôt put it together yet, the purpose of this briefing is to get it across that if you are experiencing any of the symptoms you are to report them immediately and quarantine. 

‚ÄúIs it contagious?‚Äù 

The Colonel held out his hands. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know that yet. Based on it being contained to our service personal and not spreading within the population we don‚Äôt believe it to be. But you will follow all protocol. Now,‚Äù He took a sheet of paper from his breast pocket. ‚ÄúIf you experience any of the following symptoms‚Ä¶‚Äù

He cleared his throat. 

‚ÄúUnusual or recurring dreams. Sleep walking. Sleep paralysis. Confusion. Hallucinations: Auditory or visual. Migraines. Seizures. Nosebleeds. Nausea. Or a sudden aversion to water. Please report them immediately to the number we‚Äôll be handing out.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIs this a joke? 

‚ÄúWhat the hell is an aversion to water mean? Like drinking it?‚Äù

The Colonel picked up a stack of pamphlets. ‚ÄúAny aversion. And no, this is not a joke.‚Äù

‚ÄúHas anyone died?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Hospitalization has occurred in a quarter of cases thus far, however.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan our kids get this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere have been no reports of the syndrome in adolescents.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs what it was called from there on out: The syndrome. For the first weeks after the briefing, it made hypochondriacs out of half the staff. Suddenly every sleep disturbance or weird dream had to be the syndrome. Lost your keys? Forgot a password? Uh oh. For most of us, if you had so much as an upset stomach, a phone call to security and a week of tests took the place of a Tums. 

But months past and none of us got it. The storm of anxiety it brought eventually passed. The conclusion was that the Chinese were using sonic warfare in Cuba, and the United States of America was going to get to the bottom of it. And we were plenty safe, or so we thought, half a world away. 

Then it spread.

Four months later we were called back to the embassy at 7pm for a meeting in the same media room. This time there was no colonel but a three-star general in his place. He sat at a table in a black folding chair. Ambassador Donovan came through the door, shook the general‚Äôs hand and sat beside him. The room didn‚Äôt even whisper. We sat with our respective anxiety bubbling in our guts. When the head of embassy security entered the briefing began. 

We were told that in the last week alone, the syndrome had been reported in over 3 dozen capitals. Big and small. Tokyo, Bangkok. Santo Domingo, Kuwait City. The reported symptoms were largely the same.

The syndrome, the general explained, was now characterized as a weapon of war. We were to see a physician every week where they would chart changes as minute as the growth of our fingernails.

‚ÄúWhile we‚Äôre still figuring this thing out, everything is of interest to us,‚Äù He threw out one of those military idioms. ‚ÄúIf you so much as wake up five minutes earlier than usual, you‚Äôre to report it to your physician,‚Äù The room nodded. ‚ÄúAnd one more thing, in order to ensure we have the best idea of where our people are catching this thing, we will be requiring all embassy personal to stay in a hotel.‚Äù

The room erupted. If you worked at an embassy, it was hard enough to make a new home every few years. Living in a hotel sounded like hell. While we‚Äôd all done it before it was no easy adjustment. The general stuck his hands out and lowered them to quiet the room. ‚ÄúYour families will be staying in your residences. So far there has been no reports of the syndrome in spouses or children of any embassy staff.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs being caught at the embassies!‚Äù There was a murmur of agreement.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt say for certain. That‚Äôs why we need to figure this thing out.‚Äù

I blocked out the rest of the shouted questions. I looked over to my pal Greg Greenleaf. He motioned like he had a cigarette between his fingers and nodded over his shoulder toward the door. We slipped out unnoticed during the hubbub. Outside it was already dark and I took a cigarette from Greg without a word. We smoked for a minute in silence, surrounded by the heavy heat of Jakarta and the sound and smell of traffic. 

‚ÄúSo, Russians?‚Äù

We both laughed. Greg had also spent a good chunk of his career with the DOD and knew that the only thing any other military had that we didn‚Äôt was budget issues. If we didn't have this tech, it was pretty safe to say no one did. 

‚ÄúDo you think they know what it is but just aren‚Äôt telling us?‚Äù

I took a long drag and thought about it. ‚ÄúNo. Top brass are horrible liars. If they really knew they subtly let you know that they do. All those lifers love to show off their higher clearance. But I think this fucker‚Äôs baffled.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù Greg exhaled a cloud of smoke and sighed.

‚ÄúA little unsettling ay?‚Äù 

Greg nodded. ‚ÄúA lot,‚Äù He squinted and smoked. ‚ÄúThink this is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù He rose his eyebrows and grinned.

‚ÄúOh, The Great Filter?‚Äù 

If you‚Äôre not familiar with The Great Filter Theory, it‚Äôs another rabbit hole to go down. One a lot more intriguing. The kind you can watch YouTube videos on until the early am and not feel like you're completely wasting your life by the time you go to bed.

To put the theory simply, ever since finding an abundance of planets that are in what‚Äôs known as the goldilocks zone, meaning that they‚Äôre the right distance from a star to support life, the question has arisen as to why the universe isn‚Äôt teeming with intelligent life. Why haven‚Äôt we heard a peep? 

What‚Äôs the great filter stopping intelligent life from being abundant in the universe?‚Äù Is basic life in general just rare to evolve? Do civilizations often wipe themselves out from climate change or nuclear war before exploring the cosmos? Or hardly ever mentioned, is there something out there, a civilization that stops intelligent life before it gets too noisy. Before it becomes too much of a threat to its own empire?

Long before the syndrome appeared, me and my many friends in defense would argue the most likely great filter is another advanced species. Maybe it‚Äôs the imagination in us all, or more likely the constant briefings on unidentified aerial phenomenon in our atmosphere.

If you‚Äôre not familiar, UAP is the new word for UFO. The government has been trying to get rid of the tinfoil hat stigma regarding the possibility of alien craft already surveying us. It‚Äôs a rebranding of our extraterrestrial visitors, if you will. And UAPs are everywhere: Harassing fighter jets. Interrupting military exercises. We can‚Äôt say for certain what these aircraft are. None of the officers you see speaking about it on cable news will jump to the conclusion the anchors dangle in front of them. ‚ÄúCould these be aliens?‚Äù 

They can only hint, subtly and sometimes not so much, that it would be exceedingly unlikely for any country to have developed technology so advanced. 

I first learned of The Great Filter from Bernard Fauss; a brilliant professor of nuclear chemistry I met at conference on nuclear energy in his hometown of Vienna. We got drinks that night. Enough of them to get to the topic of alien life. 

Bernard spoke excitedly. ‚ÄúI think the fallacy, the comfortable lie people and our governments love to tell themselves, is that we are not a threat whatsoever to another advanced civilization. But I‚Äôll argue that‚Äôs false.‚Äù

Bernard had been doing most the talking, and I‚Äôd sobered up considerably forgetting about my drink as I fell into the different theories he‚Äôd explain.

‚ÄúI know scientists personally who are striving to discover how to condense enough energy to create a blackhole. Here, on earth. And not the little lab one‚Äôs they‚Äôve done in Israel. The real thing. Our technology really isn‚Äôt that far off from such abilities. And think of it on a galactic time scale. One of tens of thousands of years,‚Äù The professor paused. ‚ÄúI hear it all the time: Humans are too small and stupid to ever bother an advanced species. We couldn‚Äôt be a thorn in their side if we tried. So why would they bother us?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut,‚Äù He rotated his beer on the bar top. ‚ÄúBombs are still bombs. Black holes are still blackholes. Explosive chemical reactions and the most dangerous aspects of physics, things we have in our grasp and things not that far away, will forever be dangerous to any organic being. To think other civilizations have impenetrable shields and can and would teleport away from any experiment of ours gone wrong is a nice little blanket to lie under. Humanity is absolutely a threat. 

‚ÄúI can agree with that.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight? Put yourself in their zorlobs,‚Äù He smiled and leaned forward. ‚ÄúHumans are smarter than hornets no doubt. They will never pose a threat to our species existence. But that doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt sting.‚Äù 

As enthralled as I was, I felt a tinge of anxiety creeping into me. But Bernard hardly paused.

‚ÄúStephen Hawken was convinced that our messages sent into outer space looking to contact extra-terrestrials were our own death warrant. He urged them to stop. Pleaded with them. They didn‚Äôt of course. But,‚Äù Bernard assured me. ‚ÄúAny aliens advanced whatsoever know we‚Äôre here regardless.‚Äù

Back behind the Embassy, I thought about Greg‚Äôs question. I always thought the Great Filter would be quick. That if it were to happen, one day I‚Äôd wake up and see alien machinery in the sky. And I‚Äôd raise my coffee and say, ‚ÄúAh, The Great Filter.‚Äù As if it were an old friend I was expecting and a few moments later I‚Äôd be suffocating on the ground after they poked a hole in the atmosphere. 

I leaned my head against the wall. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not impossible that's what's going on. But why are diplomats the target?‚Äù 

‚ÄúPractice for our politicians later?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. But fuck,‚Äù I took a long, lunging step with one leg. The kind men clandestinely make in hot climates, rescuing my most personified appendages from a vise of cotton. ‚ÄúA fucking hotel.‚Äù

‚ÄúLife is what you make it. Better get comfy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I will. Screwing my hand like I‚Äôm a teenager again.‚Äù 

‚ÄúTime is a flat circle.‚Äù  

We both chuckled and flicked our cigarettes out. 

Moving into the hotel was painful. I missed my wife and kids when I was working late at work. Living away for me was a nightmare. The first few days were especially rough for all of us, but after a while we got into a routine. We were told that we weren‚Äôt allowed to go home. Though I know that myself and many others broke that rule because while they told us that, there was no monitoring system for what we did during the day. The only rule for certain was that we had to be back at night. We weren‚Äôt under any circumstances allowed to sleep anywhere else but the hotel.

At 10pm an FSO would knock on your door and sign you in on a tablet. If you weren‚Äôt there you‚Äôd get written up and in building full of ambitious diplomats who all wanted to be ambassadors themselves one day, you could bet everyone was in their rooms by nine.  

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

About a week after we were put in the hotel, Greg and I were having a late dinner before heading back for the night. We often sat with Michelle, our brilliant head of the economic department. At 34 her rise to that position was stunning. Getting anywhere in the State Department typically takes one of two things, money or time.  

Greg and I were quietly eating that evening when Michelle came through the double doors spotted us and quickly walked over. She sat and sighed. 

‚ÄúHow are you Michelle?‚Äù Greg took another bite of food. 

She rolled her shoulders in an uncomfortable shrug and looked behind her quickly. ‚ÄúYou know I looked it up, not a single case Havana syndrome has been reported in a land locked capital. Every last one is one the coasts. All of them.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMost capitals tend to be on the coast.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs less than half.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚Äú195 capital cities. 102 are landlocked. And so far, not one of those 102 has a reported case.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure they will.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut not yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, yeah that is a little weird.‚Äù

She nodded a little. ‚ÄúStrange dreams,‚Äù She said quickly and licked her lips. ‚ÄúWhat does that even mean? The difference between a weird dream and a normal one is just how much of it you remember. Most dreams are fucking weird. Right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd say so.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to make of it.‚Äù

Greg set down his fork. ‚ÄúMake of what?‚Äù Michelle kept looking past us. ‚ÄúMichelle?‚Äù

‚ÄúForget it.‚Äù She suddenly shook her head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sick, but maybe a little of living in a fucking hotel.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hear ya.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you guys think-,‚Äù She paused looking off for the right words. ‚ÄúDo you think that we‚Äôre really being told everything?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom what we can tell it doesn‚Äôt seem like they know much. Hence the stupid measure of sticking us in a hotel.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone walking the halls of my floor. I tried to see who it was from the eyehole.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe check in kid?‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, they walk by too fast.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell go into the hall and see.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur doors don‚Äôt open after 10.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Said Greg.

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt noticed?‚Äù She smiled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre locked in.‚Äù

‚ÄúBullshit.‚Äù

My door has been locked the past three nights I tried it. I called the front desk and they said sometimes their key readers lock. They apologized, and I heard it unlock. But they said nothing about fixing it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho at the front desk, the American guys they put there?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù 

The doors don‚Äôt lock.‚Äù Greg leaned back and crossed his arms. 

‚ÄúHave you gone out your door past 10pm?‚Äù Greg frowned and Michelle grinned. ‚ÄúTry it.‚Äù

Back at the hotel that night Greg and I both waited until a quarter past ten, after the FSO that checked us in had long left. Our doors didn‚Äôt budge. We were locked in. 

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù It was all he texted me. We‚Äôd both been the experimenter before to know when we were the guinea pig.

The next morning, I brought it up to the Ambassador. He said the same thing about the card readers locking. He said they were looking into it. This time it was apparent he had received a briefing we hadn‚Äôt.

I dropped it after that and started looking into getting a transfer back to the U.S. Whatever was happening, or what they were expecting might, wasn‚Äôt something I intended to stick around long enough to find out about. While I didn‚Äôt have much for money I‚Äôd put in enough time; it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to get a position state side. 

A few nights after discovering we‚Äôd been locked in I went to take a shower before bed. I turned the dial, and the shower head groaned and let out a little stream of water that dribbled into the tub. No water. 

I few minutes later I heard my neighbors cursing on the other side of the wall, undoubtedly dialing the front desk. I sat on the edge of my bed and suddenly my phone lit up. Greg was calling me. I answered. 

‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs destroying their room above me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoever is above me, is trashing the shit out of their room. Do you hear it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm like dozen floors below you. I don‚Äôt hear a thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy waters off.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, mine too.‚Äù

I heard the door buzz and unlock. ‚ÄúMy door just-‚Äù We were both saying it at the same time. ‚ÄúMeet me in the lobby.‚Äù I hung up and took the stairs six flights down. 

Most people were still asleep, but a few mingled in the lobby, before I could speak to them the elevator dinged and the doors opened. It was Greg. ‚ÄúGet in.‚Äù

The others frowned but I said nothing. I stepped in and he closed the doors. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúMichelle.‚Äù He showed me his phone. The text she‚Äôd sent was rabbling.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming. They showed me have they shown you? Have you heard them? Please I‚Äôm in my room 18th floor. 1829.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

I looked up from his phone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not contagious. Right?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if it is, I‚Äôm checking on her.‚Äù

He threw out his thumb and pressed the eighteen. 

When the doors opened on the 18th floor we stepped out in tandem and quickly started down the quiet hall. 

‚ÄúThink she was the one destroying her room?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd bet on it. Everyone we saw in the lobby stays on the eighteenth floor.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see they‚Äôre a little paranoid to check in on her themselves.‚Äù

Greg squinted and looked back towards the elevator. ‚ÄúSecurity should be here by now.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey might be suiting up hazmat.‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this. You don‚Äôt have to but I‚Äôm sick of this shit.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm with you.‚Äù The idea of the syndrome driving Michelle mad made me more nervous than getting it myself. She was as stoic as it gets. And if there was anyone in the embassy under forty I wanted by my side in a pinch it was her. 

Her room was at the end of the hall, the door was open. Greg and I walked in slowly. ‚ÄúMichelle?‚Äù The mirror in the short entry hall was shattered, the bathroom door was blocked with her mattress and water pooled out from under the door onto the carpet.

Michelle was in the center of the room. Behind her, the curtains were open and outside just a mile away the ocean shined black, lit up by the light of Jakarta.  

She was on her knees furiously shoving clothes in her suitcase. ‚ÄúHave they talked to you yet?‚Äù She spoke without turning around. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in here for the embassy. We‚Äôre here to make sure you‚Äôre okay.‚Äù Greg shut the door behind him and did up all the locks.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about the State Department.‚Äù She stopped stuffing her suitcase and turned over her shoulder. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt been told? Not in your dreams?‚Äù

Greg and I looked at each other and Michelle shook her head and went back to packing. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt understand. They‚Äôre trying to reach you, all of us. Some are apparently harder than others.‚Äù

Greg took a step towards her. ‚ÄúMichelle you need-‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an NGO I was offered a job at once,‚Äù She interrupted him frantically. ‚ÄúThey drill wells for the most remote villages in Africa. One‚Äôs where there‚Äôs no water around for dozens of miles. No rivers or lakes. No ocean,‚Äù She sprung up and went to her laptop sitting open on the desk. ‚ÄúHere.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCan you just take a breath for us?‚Äù 

 ‚ÄúWells so narrow you can‚Äôt even fit down them. Enough water to live. That‚Äôs it. We have to go. We have to. because I can‚Äôt-‚Äù She breathed deeply. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go down there.‚Äù Her voice trembled. 

‚ÄúMichelle, what the fuck are you talking about?‚Äù  

I noticed tears had begun dripping down her cheeks. She started shaking her head madly. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù She slumped down and stuck her head between her legs. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening? Why did you do this to your room?‚Äù

She spoke towards the floor. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in there.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I stepped towards her. ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù 

Her eyes lit up in terror and she spoke in frantic succession. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in there. They‚Äôre in there. They‚Äôre in there. Fuck! No!‚Äù She screamed and stood grabbing her hair in handfuls.

I put my hands on her shoulders. ‚ÄúIn where!‚Äù 

She stared out the big glass pane, her eyes wide in terror. Greg and I both followed her gaze, and I felt a coldness I still can‚Äôt explain when I realized just where she meant. 

When I realized her eyes actually saw what scared her so much. That they were looking right out the window, unblinking, into the ocean.",nosleep,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pbdikk/have_you_heard_of_havana_syndrome/,Series,The_Black_Shore,pbdikk,/r/nosleep/comments/pbdikk/have_you_heard_of_havana_syndrome/,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pbdikk/have_you_heard_of_havana_syndrome/,10,2021-08-25
I almost did it.,"I was sitting in my offline tuition. Our teacher was teaching chemistry to us. The room was full. In between different topics, we were joking around as well. It was raining heavily outside, yet it was hot, possibly due to the humid weather. That's when it started. I felt a sudden uneasy feeling in my stomach.

We were only halfway through the class. I didn't wish to say it to anyone because it would be really embarrassing, mostly because 2/5 of the students were girls. So I held it in. Pretended nothing happened. Tried not to keep a straight face so that nobody suspects anything. Sometimes it cooled down, but that didn't stop me from panicking internally. Still I tried my best to hold back.

The class eventually got over in about an hour. The rain was lighter than before so I hurried to my home on my bicycle. I decided to open my umbrella but it was stuck, so I hung it on the handle and continued cycling. I wasted about five minutes of time there. The pressure on my stomach was lighter and I felt like I could make it. But the worst was yet to come.

On my way to home I have to cover an upward slope. About 30 metres/100 feet away from the slope, it hit me, again. I felt like that was it. It was about to happen right in the middle of the street. So I decided to get off my bike. I had already accepted it. I didn't care. Even if anybody realised it, it won't matter to me. My face was covered with a cap, specs and mask so nobody would know who I was. I kept moving forward. When I was climbing the slope, it was getting worse. As I kept gaining the high ground, it urged to gain the lower. 

However, as soon as I reached the top, it went quiet again. I was delighted. Now I could make it to my home. It was only three minutes away from where I was standing. I hurried towards the road crossing. On the way I almost yelled at a person for blocking the road. As soon as I reached the crossing I was lucky to find the signal Red. I quickly crossed it and entered our neighborhood. It is only 20 seconds on bike from the crossing to my apartment building so there was no point in slowing down. When I reached the building I found the gates open so I quickly took my bike inside. I didn't even bother to lock it.

I hit the door of my apartment multiple times with my umbrella so my mother can read the situation. And that she did. No sooner did she open the door than I went into the toilet. I was finally satisfied. I did it. I took my shit.

A few minutes later I realised a few things. I was drenched in both rainwater and sweat. My specs were covered entirely from the rain so that was how I figured it out. I was breathing heavily. I had already opened my mask after sitting down so that my breathing comes back to normal quicker. I was completely exhausted, but I was happy.

After I was finished I cleaned myself up and changed into new clothes. I was so tired that I threw my body on my bed and just lay down for a few minutes, while my watch, cap, phone, specs and my bike's keys lay on the table, which I previously handed over to my mother before I washed myself up. When I got back a few amount of energy, I went downstairs to lock my bike. I cancelled my next class because I guessed it might happen again, which it did. Now I lay on my bed and plan on finishing my writing, which you are reading right now.

**Long Story Short:** I almost shat myself in public.

Sorry if I made any spelling mistakes. English is not my first language, and currently I'm really tired. My eyes are cloudy even though I'm wearing my specs so I can't see properly. When I finish this, I will be resting, but I'll try to answer to the comments if get any. If you have made this far, thank you.",teenagers,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/pbdhmr/i_almost_did_it/,Rant,RonnieTheCrafter_14L,pbdhmr,/r/teenagers/comments/pbdhmr/i_almost_did_it/,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/pbdhmr/i_almost_did_it/,16,2021-08-25

"My husband betrayed my trust, what do I do?!","Hi, I‚Äôm a female. I‚Äôm 28yrs old, married with two kids. One is 5 (just started kindergarten) the other is 7 months old (looks just like me )

Today my husband and I went to Walmart to get some stuff for the kids ex. Diapers, milk, etc. After we leave Walmart he proceeds to drive home (or so I thought), he ends up parking farther away from Walmart but in the same parking lot. Here he breaks the news to me‚Ä¶  ‚Äúlast week when I went to get a massage, the masseuse gave me a üëãüèº job‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it! I giggled of course because THAT HAD TO BE A JOKE! Well he wasn‚Äôt joking.. we drove all the way home in pure silence.. Well I was silent, he wanted to know what I thought. I was shaking, I was sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. I was light headed and my heart was going at 1000 beats per minute. I also brought my mom some things from Walmart and passed by her house to drop it off.. I have no idea how I kept my composure. We finally go home and as soon as I get home I break down, I was so disappointed and disgusted! I couldn‚Äôt even bare to look at his face. I asked him what he went to get massaged and he said he went for his back. How the hell did she end up with you d*ck on her hand then? I asked. He‚Äôs never been to a massage parlor and apparently she told him to get naked and he kept his undies and she asked to take those off too.  I was so angry! Did you finish I asked? He said yes. I feel so betrayed, if a man tried to grab my va**** when I go get a massage I would run  off! So why didn‚Äôt he? What should I do?

Dealership reluctant to deal with SilverRock,"Hi everyone. On Friday I picked up an MCS from a vending machine. The experience was perfect but that isn't why I am posting.

I had the car (pre-purchase) inspected by the (sole) local dealership on Monday. They found the oil pan has a slight leak and should be replaced. They also determined that the oil pump solenoid wiring harness needed repair (although I am not sure how they determined this for *certain* being that they didn't disassemble anything and the car works fine...?) These are the only issues they discovered. They quoted $1,600 (!!!) to fix the issues.

To make a long story short(er,) after the cost of the repair was imparted to me, I immediately asked if they worked with SilverRock. There was some hemming and hawing and then an... admission (?) that they did work with SilverRock. I asked if they could file a claim with them and the advisor... really dragged his feet. He said they could call but they were really busy and implied I would have to wait around and it would be awhile. He then suggested that I call as it would make no difference. I said fine, I would call. In retrospect I shouldn't have done him any favors but after waiting over an hour for the inspection and not having eaten in several hours I just wanted to go home.

Once home I looked up the procedure for filing a claim and everything says the service shop should file it. I called the dealership and had to leave a message. The guy did call me back and I told him that he had to file the claim. He told me the parts in question were ""wearable items"" and SR probably wouldn't cover them. To me this is a non-sequitur given this is a pre-purchase inspection but I politely humored him and said there was only one way to find out. He then said that the repair would have to be one or two weeks out and that they normally had to have the car there in order to file a claim... so he let me go home knowing this??? In any case this sounded very backward to me, but I simply said, ""If I file a claim SilverRock will give me a rental, but how can they give me a rental if there is no claim?"" to which he said, ""Oh, we have complimentary rentals."" I think, *you are going to let me drive your car for a week or two before my appointment with the assumption they will approve the claim which you are trying to convince me to not bother filing??* But at this point I can only assume he realized how absurd the conversation was becoming because the very next thing he said was, ""Yeah, I can call SilverRock, I can call them right now.""

Okay, finally, *great*. We finished the call and at this point I'm exasperated because of hassle I'm getting over SR. I decided to more closely inspect the itemized estimate that he incidentally forgot to give me until I asked, and I notice they are quoting around $500 for manual transmission oil when my car is an automatic and the transmission is not even involved. I also notice they are quoting 3 hours of labor to swap the oil pan and replace the oil, which seems a bit excessive. I really wish I had noticed all this earlier but naively I assumed that the dealership would not engage in such... things. Stupid of me.

Anyway, I don't have any experience employing third party warranties or negotiating service with dealerships so at this point I'm feeling rather insecure. I did get a text from SR about an hour after the call saying a claim was filed but by then I was starting to look into independent shops... I am reluctant to even let the dealership touch the car at this point. I've never felt less valued as a customer. It's awful. What should I do?? This car is fantastic and I am afraid to let them handle it further given the nonsense that they have already so brazenly inflicted upon me.",carvana,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/carvana/comments/pb0vj0/dealership_reluctant_to_deal_with_silverrock/,Question,grig_orig,pb0vj0,/r/carvana/comments/pb0vj0/dealership_reluctant_to_deal_with_silverrock/,https://www.reddit.com/r/carvana/comments/pb0vj0/dealership_reluctant_to_deal_with_silverrock/,14,2021-08-25
I am afraid i've fucked it up and being friend zoned or - even worse - just used,"Summary at the end, pardon any typos or wrong grammar as English is not my first language

Basically, I (34M) matched with this girl (34) on bumble in late May. She pretty soon told me to be willing to meet me and get to know me but at the time we were allowed due to COVID restrictions (she is also a bit paranoid about this still).
We kept on chatting and whatsapping and then finally we meet for some outdoor hiking: was good, had fun, of course no deep physical contact still due to this COVID fear from her side (she only had 1st vaccine shot at the time). She then proposed to meet again the day after and we went for some wine tasting in some nice cellars in the countryside. 

Fast forward to vacation time, we kept writing each others (she also initiated the convos) and then we met again after almost one month after our last date earlier this week. 
At this time, we both had 2nd vaccine shot so I tried to push a little bit more for physical contact, I also took quick test (as I travelled abroad for vacation) to make her feel safer and more comfortable.

Main issues I am having now are the following:
- we have really good time together, we shared also personal stuff and we have nice connection, she also told me that. I only started now with putting more physical contact with her due to her past COVID fears, but I dont see same intention from her side
- we usually do cool stuff together, therefore I am starting to doubt the fact she is interested in the things I organize rather than me (wine tasting, hiking, lake trips, pic nic at the beach at night, also went to a mining cave trip) Next date I am going to propose her is just a drink at a bar, no more outdoors/cool stuff in order to better understand this
- when I take her home, she always says she had good time but then never seems to be kinda open for kiss even though I did not push too much for it (as said, she had been wearing mask in the car until yesterday - we had a total of 5 dates so far, only 2 as both of us fully vaccinated. And even there I did not feel fully confident in pushing too much because of this fear she has). Plus she never sends a late night/gnight message saying thanks... but then she writes me in the next days about whatever thing or just to talk
- im really easygoing and talkative person and I fear that she sees that as just being a friend, even though i reminded her more than once that im not intending to become one of her friends... but still, no strong reaction from her side. My ex gfs saw that as a positive personality trait - which i am not willing to change at all in order to be liked by whoever - therefore i would not say that being the way i am would lead directly to friendzone...it may happen though as each woman is different, but I also made some remarks about not willing to become her dear friend (probably not strong enough).

Any advice?

30[F4M] Two Outcasts/in a fantasy setting. (Descriptive/Literate),"**If this post is up, I‚Äôm still looking. All posts in my post history are also still available to do, too.**

**Note:** *I write multiple paragraphs in third person, but can do first person if need be.* (I on average send 3-4 paragraphs per post but it varies.) *Preferably long-term RP as I can‚Äôt always do back and forth. Patience and an understanding that real life takes precedence is needed from a potential partner. - Writing examples can be provided upon request. - Thank you.*

**I don‚Äôt RP on Reddit solely. I have Kik, Telegram, and Discord!**

The following idea I have is fantasy based. It may seem D&amp;amp;amp;D-esque, but that‚Äôs just my love for fantasy. Lol I‚Äôm not looking to GM or to be GMed, I enjoy cooperative RP. Sharing the world and having fun together. Writing something that we both enjoy is what I‚Äôm really interested in. 

So, my idea is still a bit rough. But I do like it flexible enough to where we can brainstorm together. 

As for my character, I was thinking of something naturistic. I‚Äôll probably build her race and class type around what compliments your character best, but I‚Äôm thinking a ranger/drow, or druidic/elf. - She‚Äôs living on the outskirts of a prosperous kingdom, one of which she has been exiled from. 

Her reason for exile, I am thinking, is she has been dishonored for some reason, and it has been her punishment to leave. - I was thinking she was framed in a crime she did not commit, and has shamefully left. 

As for your character, he can be whoever you‚Äôd like! - But my idea is that he ends up on my characters door step in dire need of help. This could be he‚Äôs badly injured, or overwhelmed by an enemy and seeking refuge? Either way, they come together and are forced to bond this way. - My character can find and heal him, bringing him within her home; and nursing him to health. Which begs to ask, what brought him here? 

I like the idea that he was chased by ex guild members, which he discover corruption in. Or maybe he‚Äôs a rouge and got chased out of the city, unbeknownst to my character, by guards. 

But now our characters are cozy together. Two outcasts in a fantasy setting. To add spice the ones who chased your character off can find us and force us to go on the run at some point. What do we even have to lose? Maybe we can make something of ourselves elsewhere?

**Kinks** Dom/sub, Master/slave, giving oral sex, (deep throat, passionate) teasing, dirty talk, grinding, outercourse, edging, orgasm control and denial, incest, sleep play, mutual masturbation, big cum shots, cream pies, (no pregnancy) light pain, romance, vaginal, anal, and more. 

**Limits** scat, gore, vore, excessive feet stuff, pregnancy and birth, inflation, lactation, group, maybe more. 

I don‚Äôt expect all kinks to be included or shared. 

**Again, I don‚Äôt RP on Reddit solely. I have Kik, Telegram, and Discord!**

Having Issues with Bathroom/kennel Training my dog.,"Hey all, 

* This my first time posting on this sub so I apologize for any mistakes!  So my girlfriend and I are are both first time puppy owners and we recently purchased an 8 week old Bernese Mountain Dog and as the title mentions we are having issues setting up a schedule a good training program for him. To provide more context, my girlfriend and I are both gone most of the day. She teaches from 7-5 and I am on campus working towards my masters degree. My girlfriend is unable to come home and take our puppy out but I have a block of time once a day to come home and feed and take him out. 
* The issue we are having is that when we take him out in the morning he will run outside and go pee and not  poop. Then we bring him back inside feed him and wait about 10-15 before taking him out again. But, he won't go to the bathroom and just lay or sit down. Within 30-20 minutes later he will go. This was not a problem for the first few days but as school is starting up we don't have time to wait for him  and take him out 30 minutes later. The same situation situation occurs during lunch when I come back to feed him. The only time this is not an issue is during dinner. I guess I am not sure when to take him out? Should he be eating before I take him out in the mornings? He had quite a a few mistakes this way and I don't know how to change this. 
* My second question comes to what size his kennel should be. We got him a massive kennel with a divider so he could grow into it. Currently we have it set up so that we can put a small  crate pad 30in x 23in and a folded up training pad (about half the size of the bed)  to fill up the rest. Every morning he seems to be using the bed to pee on and the pad to sleep on. Is there a way to curb this behavior? Should I be making the kennel even smaller to fit him just so? 
* This is on a side note but partially has to with kennel  training. I feed all my puppy food to him in the kennel and he does really well. But he almost refuses to eat in the kennel in the mornings and afternoon's as he has just been in there for the past 4 hours.  He will only eat the food if I sit in front of the kennel and hold the food bowl for him which leaves me no time to eat myself.

Note: It was not the original plan to get a puppy if we had to go back to school in person. The schools original plan was to be in person for this current semester but with the FDA approval of the vaccine, the school has decided to go back in person. As of right now we are doing online orientation so I have been at home with my puppy for about 8 days but as of the 3rd we will both go back in person.

Mary Geoise Was The Ancient Kingdom - One Piece Theory,"[This is a long read, here's the theory in video format](https://youtu.be/Gfirinwt7FA)

&amp;#x200B;

*You might know me from my ""Blackbeard is an Octopus"" Reddit thread. But today's theory, is that Mary Geoise was the Ancient Kingdom!*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[This all started back in July 13th, 2020. At around 2AM my time, i posted a theory on a discord server and people ever since then seemed to like it. At the time, i was rereading One Piece and after diving into chapter 295 again \(this is the chapter professor clover dies\)](https://preview.redd.it/dz2obwh2wej71.png?width=543&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38e833883e5989995d080145a35f68f10c019fe1)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[I questioned myself... why was the Gorosei so calm about Professor Clover's Rant, until the moment he went to say the name of the ancient kingdom?  That is strikingly odd, and it's definitely a clue by Oda, let me explain why. The world government has been known for silencing people. The world government wants the poneglyphs hidden and they want nothing about the void century uncovered. Remember Ohara? A bustercall was issued on that island. So many people died and this includes children, all because they studied history. If Professor Clover stated a name that wasn't relevant in today's time, nobody would piece anything together. It wouldn't be recognizable and wouldn't be a threat to the world government. Thats when it hit me.](https://preview.redd.it/rrj090q4wej71.jpg?width=760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3020eb43ce54653de3f9d000aa2dccb3e5184512)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[The name of the Ancient Kingdom IS relevant in today's time. That's why they ordered to have him shot. There would be a public freakout if clover was to say \\""the name of the ancient kingdom is mary geoise!\\"". People would realize that this kingdom was outright stolen from the rightful owners and leaders.](https://preview.redd.it/1ug2bkp5wej71.jpg?width=760&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=289179c01e823b57e5e4b12c1ecee07f41faf66f)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[In chapter 722, According to Donquixote Doflamingo, the 20 kings from 20 countries gathered at the world's center and created one gigantic institution. That's the current \\""world government\\"". Current? So there was a former world government? We can infer due to the worldwide power of the ancient kingdom, that they were the former world government. And the creator kings, decided to take their families and live in Mary Geoise. But this begs the question, why Mary Geoise? Why an empty, deserted land? This is a misdirection by Oda. The location was specifically targeted by the World Government, not by a random chance. The kingdom, utilities and power was already there; it was above the redline. What the 20 kings decided to do, was raid a location for their valuables. Why build such a beautiful, powerful, advanced kingdom like Mary Geoise.... when you can just take it? Funny how the world government raids and steals just like pirates. The people already living there was also revealed to us as well....](https://preview.redd.it/a0ixjjt7wej71.png?width=778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fa26e85b742d852a549c5e8e03a00606e565f11)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[As of  chapter 1022, it is revealed  by Marco, that \\""King\\"" of the Beast Pirates is a part of the race, that lived above the red line. Marco explicitly states \\""i used to hear rumors about a certain fire conjuring race that lived on top of the red line. King of the flames huh?\\"" So basically, the ancient kingdom had a race of people who were fire conjurers. It's very interesting, because Previous to this, we did not have canon proof anyone ever lived above the red line. For all we know, mary geoise could very well have been formed at a deserted land. Why is this significant? Because this is a piece to the puzzle, of the Ancient Kingdom.](https://preview.redd.it/ecbfzf6awej71.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fd279efd8d36289af832c78b3ed5cdef7e8d7ce)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[King's ancestors use to live in the Ancient Kingdom! King's race, lived ontop of the redline, and the 20 kingdoms were jealous of this worldwide power and decided to take them out. And they wanted this raid to be hidden, that's why they wiped out King's race. King should have a vendetta against the world government, if he has any care in the world about his people.](https://preview.redd.it/9j8im4sbwej71.png?width=892&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32218277a9237ad2d1ad8ee6afad4ab9541c997a)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[A discord friend by the name of Jwop47 believes that Nika is a part of the Fire Conjuring race. I think this is plausible as well, due to who's who's dialogue. In chapter 1018 i came across something pretty peculiar. Who's Who says that slaves in ancient times, believed a sun god would arrive to save them. I believe those slaves in ancient times, were former residents of the ancient kingdom, and that Nika, this sun god, was the leader of the fire conjuring race.](https://preview.redd.it/zzcu4tucwej71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2202e1e1026768e3e7849f11ddaec4d2fc9199e7)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[The red line is a massive, impenetrable wall, and to scale it would be no easy feat. Bringing tools up there and all this machinery would take take centuries of work. During a visit at Mary Geoise, we are also told that the trees there are manmade. That's very odd and peculiar. Was the land destroyed so bad to the point they had to get artificial manmade trees? I wonder what could've occurred for the landscape to be tarnished....üòâ](https://preview.redd.it/heckl4zdwej71.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70db51c1952aca3437d8035a1d2466a41c0a5ed9)

[Onto a more miniscule note, i'm not a fan of trying to decipher silhouettes and such. But taking a look at the Ancient Kingdom's picture, the roof of the buildings and the design of the windows fits the look of mary geoise buildings. I might be looking a little too much into this, but it's pretty similar.](https://preview.redd.it/84lnifmiwej71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=744a58304229c0a98bc3771b9af43a1de4129636)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Do you remember how Corazon stated that the \\""D\\"" people are \\""enemies of God\\""? That is a obvious hint that the the D is by fate, forever tied into being the enemy of the current world government. Rocks D. Xebec attempted to destroy the home of the celestial dragons; god valley. Luffy straight up punched a celestial dragon and caused a huge mess out of it at sabaody archipelago. The list goes on. The celestial dragons seem to believe that they are gods. Mary Geoise is stated to be the \\""holy land\\"", the home of these \\""Gods\\"". Not only do they enslave animals, they enslave humans as well. They treat any average townsfolk as trash.  They even wear helmets in order to not breath the same air as a regular human being. It's actually quite hypocritical. You would think Gods or Holy People would spread love and joy, but it turns out they are the stereotypical idea of a pirate; an asshole. Knowing that the 20 Kings came together and took out the ancient kingdom, infers that the people of this ancient kingdom are \\""enemies of god\\"" or \\""demons\\"". And im willing to bet they are only labeled as demons, because of the GOD COMPLEX of the celestial dragons. Anyone who opposes them or has different ideals is considered wrong or evil.](https://preview.redd.it/aohnhz1kwej71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98855fcf4a07a4f27d7de56a9152ffd8978a6f93)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[The Ancient Weapons are the argument used by the World Government to forbid research of the Void Century, since they fear that knowledge of the weapons could result in a global war. Do you know why? The current world government is afraid that the powers of the ancient weapons will fall into the wrong hands; not themselves. The ancient kingdom must have been wiped out with the use of these weapons. and due to the aftermath of the war, maybe thru joyboy or nika, the weapons slipped out of their hands. The gorosei is so scared of these ancient weapons... because they've used them before. Shirahoshi being Poseidon makes it harder for the WG to track and control. Pluton may be in the WG possession or destroyed, but the fact that there's blueprints of it means it could be used to destroy the redline or possibly mary geoise. As far as uranus, we're not sure if its an object or person, but if its a person, again, it's harder for them to track and control.](https://preview.redd.it/dx19ol0mwej71.jpg?width=696&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c98684073e4265353a56dae27a3d1d07c1945552)

[Here's an example of the Gorosei with scars. Why do they have scars, if they are world government officials who sit in an office all day?

**So let's have a quick recap:** 

* There was an ancient kingdom, grandiose and prideful who were living ontop of the redline. 
* They had worldwide power and was considered the world government. This ancient kingdom had people of a fire conjuring race as well. 
* 20 Kingdoms came together and eliminated the ancient kingdom and performed a genocide on this fire conjuring race. 
* Once this was complete, at the tale end of the genocide, the 20 kingdoms went to that ancient kingdom and claimed ownership, and named it Mary Geoise. 
* They also started calling themselves ""Gods"" and ""Celestial Dragons"", while referring to any lucky survivors of the ancient kingdom as ""enemies of Gods"".

My friends tried to hide a relationship between my crush and another boy,"To quickly summarize the situation, i've (17m) been attracted to this girl(17f - Nora) for the last three years. We'd flirt back and forth, but when I asked her out three months ago, Nora told me ""I love flirting and being romantic, but I don't feel ready to be in a relationship yet"". I told her I understood, however I didn't want to be half-dating, I wanted to either be fully dating, or remain purely as friends. We agreed to remain as friends. However I never stopped loving her. I talked to all my friends about it, and they said she'd ""come around to it, or you'd move on. It'll be alright"" Last week everything changed. I noticed something strange. Her snap-map location was off. We had an agreement to keep them on for each other at all times as a way of making sure we were safe. That wasn't the only weird thing though. 

I noticed a few of my friends (Cale, Haydn and Mark, all 17M) were hanging out at Cale's house. I checked my texts, but no one ever mentioned anything to me. I also noticed a guy named Nate(18M) there as well. Nate was friends with Cale, but Nate and I were never close. I texted Haydn asking what was going on, and he told me ""I thought Nate or Nora would have talked to you"" Turns out Nate and Nora had been flirting back and forth for around six months, and Cale was hosting a private hangout at his house so that I ""Wouldn't get hurt by Nate and Nora's infatuation with each other"". The problem is that i've been destroyed by this. It's not the fact that Nate and Nora are into each other, I understand that sometimes couples aren't meant to be. It's the fact that she didn't tell me the truth about everything. it also hurts that Cale didn't invite me over, and he left me at home to sit in my misery. I decided to block out Nora from my life, and me and Nate got into a fight about it the last time I spoke to him. I've been drinking a lot the last few days, something i've never done before. I've sought out help from my mom, and she's helping me off the alcohol. But i'm still not sure what to do with any of my friends or Nora.

 I love Cale, Mark and Hadyn. Hadyn has been my rock for the last few years. He's helped me through so much. The problem is that Nate is also close to all three of them. They'd never abandon Nate and Nora for me, and I don't expect them to do that. I just don't ever want to speak to Nora again, but i'm afraid that isn't a possibility. Sorry for the convoluted mess, if anyone needs me to clarify something i'd love to.",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pbgfju/my_friends_tried_to_hide_a_relationship_between/,,Throwaway18264219,pbgfju,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pbgfju/my_friends_tried_to_hide_a_relationship_between/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pbgfju/my_friends_tried_to_hide_a_relationship_between/,3,2021-08-25
My brother has become a nightmare,"I have one sibling, a brother, and his failure to launch is causing a lot of tension in the family currently. He is in his mid-late-twenties, is willingly unemployed without unemployment benefits, dropped out of college with a few credits left after my parents spent an absorbent amount of money to help him, and has no plan or desire to make any moves from his current position. He has become a monster to be around and is just plainly insufferable. My parents co-signed our student loans and are incredibly stressed of needing to pay his student loans when his money does run out, which hasn't seemed to inspire him to make any moves. Any job you do suggest to him he doesn't want but for some reason does want my job (which requires a degree) and seems to be incredibly frustrated that I have it. He didn't used to be this way at all so we have given him a lot of room, support, and opportunities to recieve help if he needs or wants it but refuses.
My mom had a recent major medical emergency which resulted in a shortly warned and fairly major and expensive surgery. With covid, my family doesn't have the resources we would normally to help with day to day. We had a family discussion about it and decided we would be all-hands-on-deck to help keep the ship afloat and that I would be on stand-by for auxilary support since my parents' house is on the way home from work.
For some time now, I have been called multiple times a week to stop by on the way home to help because my brother won't. He has become completely miserable to be around and highly combative. I'm happy to help my parents because it means that my mom gets the help she deserves so she can focus on resting and my dad can get the work done needed to afford my mom's treatment. What I'm not happy doing is walking into the house and met with my brother's nonsense. My parents are at their whits ends. They can't kick him out because there would be nowhere for him to go nor does he have any credit to his name to rent anywhere, they can't make him get a job despite their best efforts, and they are stressed enough with the current situation with my mom. There‚Äôs not much that I can do besides trying to talk to him with all the compassion I can muster, which has yet to go well. I feel like I'm constantly walking on egg shells around him now. I have my own family, my own home, and my own career to worry about and due to the amount of time I'm spending there and the emotional exhaustion afterwards, my duties as a partner are falling behind which is doing nothing good for my partner who is going through some valid and tough issues with work and his own family. To be fair, it's not entirely on my brother for my experiences there being what they are, it's very hard to see how burnt out and empty my parents are currently and I feel a sense of responsbility to help them through this chapter in life. If I say I'm not going to keep going over there, my mom doesn't get the care and support she deserves and unfair amount of stress will be put on my father who already has heart issues. If I keep going over there, an unfair amount of stress will be put on my partner who is already not doing well due to his own job and I fear a complete emotional break down is looming. If my brother is going through a hard time, I understand and have made it clear I am here to help in any way that I can, but that does not mean he gets to treat us the way he is and causing the deep level of anxiety that he has. I don't even know what to do any more and I'm hoping someone can breathe some perspective into this so I can make good moves forward.",JUSTNOFAMILY,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/pbgr1p/my_brother_has_become_a_nightmare/,Gentle Advice Needed,sweaterhorizon,pbgr1p,/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/pbgr1p/my_brother_has_become_a_nightmare/,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/pbgr1p/my_brother_has_become_a_nightmare/,2,2021-08-25
Help me diagnose an issue I had yesterday (1999 Sport),"Hey everyone, hoping I can get some opinions on an issue I had yesterday.

I drove my Jeep about 20 minutes to work yesterday, then on the way back I stopped to pick up my girlfriend. As I was idling outside her building, my Jeep began to idle really rough, almost like it was running out of gas. I gave the gas pedal a few pumps to see if I could get it to catch and idle higher to no avail. Almost felt like the gas pedal had 0 effect. Turning it off then back on would idle the same, no improvement. Then I popped the hood and as I was walking to the front, it started idling fine. I hadn‚Äôt done anything to it. Weird. So then we drove for maybe 15 minutes through traffic and lights, then randomly did it again as I was stopped at a light. Turned it off then right back on and it was fine again. Drove for maybe 5 more minutes on our way to pick up dinner, I could floor it and it felt fine, picked up speed and acted normally at higher revs. Then idled outside the restaurant for 5 mins as I picked up food, working fine. Finally on the last stretch home, stopped at another light, and it started idling rough again. If I tried to give it gas, it died. Turned off and back on, still rough. Off and back on again and it just cranks and stumbles but won‚Äôt turn over. Same story after trying a few times, just couldn‚Äôt get it to turn over. I had to push it through the light and park it on the side of the street for the night, luckily only two blocks from home. This morning, I go to look at it, and it turns over completely fine and I can drive it home.

I‚Äôve never experienced this issue before. Up until now, my jeep has been in perfect working order. My thoughts now are the fuel pump, maybe plugs or injectors, but also reading some threads here I think the CPS may be something to look into.

Anybody have and ideas or similar experiences?",CherokeeXJ,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CherokeeXJ/comments/pba2nh/help_me_diagnose_an_issue_i_had_yesterday_1999/,1997-99,Mitcharrr,pba2nh,/r/CherokeeXJ/comments/pba2nh/help_me_diagnose_an_issue_i_had_yesterday_1999/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CherokeeXJ/comments/pba2nh/help_me_diagnose_an_issue_i_had_yesterday_1999/,23,2021-08-25
Training with the switch [M/F] [D/S],"it was a cold winter day and he had instructed me to dress warm. we were going for a hike, so I choose my leggings, jeans, layered shirts, and coat as I despised feeling the bitter wind against my skin. after a bit, we had stopped for a break along the trail. ""On your knees,"" he instructed, and his tone automatically incited butterflies in my stomach, half from excitement, half from anxiety. 

my eyes flickered about the area as I did what I was told, looking for other people in proximity. we were alone on the trail, but that could change at any minute. the weekend visit to the state forest didn't seem busy, but I'd greeted a few people along the way before we'd come to the current secluded spot. secluded, but public. 

at least the spot he stopped us at was soft, albeit cold, against my knees and there weren't tiny rocks digging into my skin (hard lessons learned from other occasions).

I eye the bulge that has now appeared in his pants, my attention half on it, and half listening for the snapping of twigs that would alert me to anyone else coming. I trusted he had picked a good spot, hidden by the bend of the trail, but anyone turning the corner would get a surprise. 

""Better hurry,"" he said y in amusement, but the expression on his face makes me think twice about the smart comment about to roll off my lips. I settle for sticking out my tongue, as I pull his cock free and take in the sight for a moment, licking my lips. he let me linger, inches away, as his cock twitches to catch my visual attention. 

I lean forward and slide my tongue over its bulging head. his hand finds my hair and he buries his fingers through it softly as I trail my tongue slowly over the tip, then down to the base, then back up again, creating a glistening sheen of salvia over his cock, but never taking him fully in my mouth. I tease him, letting my teeth just barely scrape over the head, causing his already well endowed cock to grow even larger. 

he makes a low groan as I pop just his head in my mouth and suck gently. he pushes his hips forward, trying to go deeper, but I put my hands on his hips to brace myself and stop him. using just one hand to cup his balls, I take another few centimeters of him in my mouth. I pull my head back, letting his cock slide out of my mouth, my teeth barely grazing him again. his hand tightens a little in my hair, but he continues, as always, showing perfect restraint. 

For now. 

right now, he just lets me play.
there is such a wetness between my thighs, but I resist the growing need to touch my throbbing clit, wanting to focus entirely on him. my nipples are hard, despite the layers of clothing; they beg for attention, but I ignore them too as I take one of his balls into my mouth gently, swirling my tongue over it and then giving the other the same treatment. 

I freeze when I hear a distant voice, but his hand against my head ensures that I can't pull away. I make a small sound of panic, but his other hand is reaching down. he begins to lift up my shirt and immediately my response is to assist him. he deftly pinches one of my nipples between his fingers as a warning, making me gasp and jump slightly. 

I wrap my hand around the base of his cock firmly as I continue using my mouth and tongue on his balls and slide my hand around his impressive girth, twisting my wrist as I do. I moan as he jerks forward into my hand, wanting more friction, more wetness, more warmth. I slip my other hand down to loosen my jeans and my fingers reach into the warmth between my legs. I return to his cock to add my juices around it before tightening my grip around him with each involuntary thrust. his breath is getting heavy and he thrusts forward again. ""Mouth, now,"" he orders. 

I happily oblige, pressing his cock to my lips for a moment before I look up at him. once my eyes meet his, I take the length of him into my mouth, and clamp my lips tightly around him as I suck, rolling my tongue over his cock. I don't lose my eye contact, while slowly working my way back to the tip of his cock, before taking him back in. I like how his cock jumps in my mouth, the way his precum tastes, and the sounds he makes. I can feel his hands holding my head in place, I want more, to please him, to feel him, and want it now. this time, when I think I hear the sound of passersby, I pay no mind. 

his hand tightens in my hair, and he angles my head to make me look directly at him. and I think then, with a little smirk, that play time is over. 

""Open."" I open my mouth even wider, but he's already begun thrusting deep into the recess of my throat. he's inside my mouth, filling me, his head hitting the back of my throat, pushing past. I make a slight gag reflexively, but swallow to let him slide in. 

""Good girl,"" he says as he forces my head closer to his belly. I lick whatever part I can as he thrusts in and out of my mouth. he uses my hair to guide me forward and back, meeting him with each thrust.¬† his cock slips past the back of my throat with each thrust, at times he holds it there, forcing me to breathe through my nose and stare up at him... the fullness of his cock taking up every space in my mouth and throat. I can barely close my lips before he's pulling back and then pushing forward again. 

I'm moaning, too. he can feel the vibrations against his cock. I want him to cum in my mouth. I want to taste him  and swallow every drop he gives me. I don't care how messy I look, that spit is dripping from my mouth, or that my eyes are watering. I'm lost in bliss filled enthusiasm as he fucks my face.¬† there is satisfaction in knowing how much pleasure he's getting from what I can do. his thrusts begin to change in rhythm. the look in his eyes, and the way his hard cock moves in my mouth, against my tongue, tells me he's getting close. but, he's not ready yet. there is more to be had. 

""Pants down. Turn around."" he demands. ""but first, you have to get me something. it's time to find a switch."" 
we'd talked about this before. I know a good switch needs to be as straight as possible, a bit firm, but with some flexibility to it.¬†using it...that was going to be a whole different experience. 

""what about that tree?"" I asked, pointing to the one to our left. he approached it, looking at some of the branches and after a brief examination, snapped one off. using his knife skillfully, he skinned it, taking off the small bumps then¬† stripping it with his fingers. 
""Nervous?"" he asked with a wicked grin. I smiled and shook my head no, which was a lie but I was more nervous about baring my ass in the cold, I think. when he was finished he held it up for inspection. he then had me face forward against the tree, hands outstretched on either side above me,, as the bottom half of my clothes were swiftly lowered to my ankles, my legs spread apart.¬† 
he stood in front of me and looked me right in the eyes. ""the spanking is not done until I am done. you need to count to 10. is that understood?"" 

I nodded my head nervously, trying not to look at the switch in his hand. 

again he repeated, the look in his eyes growing darker, ""do you understand?"" 

""yes Sir,"" I quickly whispered. 

""Shoulders back, tits out,"" he looked at me for a reply. 

""yes Sir."" 

the next thing I knew was a whistling and a terrible pain in my ass just as I heard the 'crack' sound on my skin. I slammed against the tree, my nails gripping as firmly as possible. I really didn't want to make a noise. I just about managed to keep quiet. 

""one. thank you Sir."" 

he walked around to the other side of the tree and before I could hardly think I heard that whistle and a little squeal escaped from my mouth before I managed to get myself together and call out: ""two.""
again he moved to the other side before giving me the third stroke. as I managed to say the count with a bit of a tremble, I started thinking that my ass must be beginning to turn a hot pink color, and it wasn't from the bitter cold.. with the fourth crack across my bottom, I screamed loudly and I suddenly thought that I must be leaking fluids down my legs. I was really aroused! my screams weren't only from pain but from the pleasure this was giving me. I didn't have to worry about that for long. 
five. as soon as I managed to stumble through the count of six, he told me to let go of the tree and step back. I was confused. I knew I had to have ten. I was wondering how I could take it because my ass was throbbing, but surely he wasn't going to let me off with 4 left to go. 

""grab your ankles and hold them as wide apart as you can."" 

I was freezing cold by this point,¬† my ass stinging but a bit numb, yet I'm wondering what this new angle might mean. what area is he aiming to hit in a spot that hadn't already been punished?¬† nothing could have prepared me for what did happen. 

I watched as he rose his arm and heard the whistling as the switch came down. he hit me right across the back of my thighs and I yelled out loud, letting go of my ankles.
I saw the stern look in his eyes before I could even respond with the number ""7.""¬† I grabbed my ankles as quickly as I could and then sputtered out the count. 

""seven. thank you Sir."" I was positive my ass was now a deep red color with even a little purple in some spots. he raised his arm again.
my ass, legs, and pussy were on fire after that last stroke. I let go of my ankles and clasped both hands between my legs, as I awaited the final smacks...nine. ten. my head was spinning; I felt that warm tingly glow of a building orgasm along with the pain. 

he told me to stand up, return to the tree, with my hands clasped behind my back. he came up behind me and allowed his fingers to probe the outer parts of my lips, already slick, finding I was not cold from the elements around us, but burning hot. slicking his fingers with the fluid, he slipped them easily inside. my body twitched as he slipped not just one finger, but two, and then a third.¬†my body went rigid before letting out one long groan.
I heard the sound of his jeans unzipping, and began to unconsciously grind against the tree. he took my hips in his hands, as he thrust his already engorged cock deep inside my warm pussy in one fast motion. he started thrusting, faster, faster, until he was really screwing me, fucking me so hard, I was practically pulling the bark off of the tree. I could feel his cock quiver, twitch, and then erupt inside me. a wet warmth spread inside my pussy as his throbbing cock flooded me with ropes of cum. his cock pulsed again and again and AGAIN, and as he came he kept thrusting, driving me to yet another orgasm thanks to his cock and the tree. finally, after what seemed like minutes of me writhing against his firm body, we were still. his grasp on my hair softens, and I saw a gentle smile,¬† ""good girl,"" he praised. 
it was time to get dressed and sort out how I was going to sit for the long ride home.",BDSMerotica,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMerotica/comments/pbhzim/training_with_the_switch_mf_ds/,,comehither4pleasure,pbhzim,/r/BDSMerotica/comments/pbhzim/training_with_the_switch_mf_ds/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMerotica/comments/pbhzim/training_with_the_switch_mf_ds/,1,2021-08-25
[Letter],"My partner quotes Jordan, Brianne brown and Russell Brand to me.
He has zero insight in to his part in things and has a way of talking about things that puts me down, makes me feel like I‚Äôm doing something wrong, and if I react I am ‚Äòdefensive‚Äô.
He wants me to use natural deodorant, which i was happy to try, but I stink and he won‚Äôt let me go back to antiperspirant.
He wants me to use toothpaste with no fluoride in it, again happy to try it but my dentist recommended using toothpaste with fluoride in it and when I brought it up ‚Äòof course a dentist will say that, they don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs a poison‚Äô.
He doesn‚Äôt want me to drink alcohol because I could get cancer from it. I‚Äôm not a big drinker. But I feel guilty even having one at a wedding because of how he will respond when I come home.
He wants me home by 6pm and we MUST eat dinner together. 
If I want to see friends, right before I leave he will tell me how bad they are as friends (for example: because I‚Äôm going to them and they‚Äôre not coming to me). He also needs to know exactly how long I‚Äôll be gone for and if I‚Äôm late, I don‚Äôt care about him.
Our biggest fight happened a few weeks ago when I put on a dress that was low cut to go to a friends birthday (which he was also invited to).
He said ‚Äòyou look slutty, I don‚Äôt like sluts. They‚Äôre disgusting. They make me feel sick and right now my girlfriend looks like one.‚Äô ‚ÄòThere are guys out there that would allow you to express yourself the way you want, I‚Äôm not one of them.‚Äô ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not exceptional, you‚Äôre cliche‚Äô. ‚ÄòDo you think you‚Äôre going to find a guy who loves and adores you and let‚Äôs you go out dressed like a slag? To go out drink and poison yourself? Let you be on antidepressants all your life?‚Äô. ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt be trusted, for such a smart girl you make terrible decisions‚Äô. 

I asked him if he would do couples counselling  with me but he said ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have issues, you have issues. You have problems, you‚Äôre manic depressive‚Äô (I‚Äôm not manic depressive).

Honestly. I had hoped to link him in with Jordan for psych because I think that‚Äôs the only person he might listen to.

I don‚Äôt know how to help us and I feel anxious about every action I take.

Is it normal for you ex to trash you after a break up?,"I was in the longest most important relationship of my life for the past 5 years. It's been 5 months now since our break up. He's seemed completely unfazed from the very start of the break up. He never looked back. He deleted all my pictures and blocked me on everything. Which I still don‚Äôt understand because he was always friends with his ex‚Äôs and kept pics of him and them up on his social media, I remember because I thought it was weird when we first got together. Our relationship started out amazing. We connected on such a deep level. I fell in love with his kind eyes and amazing sense of humor. I felt like I had known him my whole life, like I had finally found the person I was supposed to be with. I fell so deeply in love with him. I remember talking to him and time would just fly by. I wanted to spend every moment with him. But soon after he was moving to LA to follow his dreams. He wanted to make sure I could handle a long-distance relationship as we both lived on the East Coast when our love story began. I said of course I could. I would have done anything; he was everything I‚Äôve ever wanted in a guy. We were best friends, lovers and soulmates. We talked about marriage very often, having a home and family together, even baby names.  
 

I didn‚Äôt mind being in a long-distance relationship because I was already so used to being alone. I‚Äôve been alone my whole life. Never needing anyone. Doing everything on my own, going on adventures by myself, going to movies by myself, going to bars/ new places all by myself. Sure you could say I was a loner but it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt have friends. I just prefer to never depend on anyone but myself. Like most people, I come from an abusive background. I had to grow up so fast. I had to act like an adult taking care of grown adults while I was still a child. I found solace in being alone. I filled my world with books and dreams of what a future could be. Stupidly I would tell myself that my life was so hard because one day it would be so beautiful. I would find a place and person that felt like home, live out my days in happiness, feeling safe and loved.   
 

This past year and a half I was going through the hardest time of my life. Living through multiple family crises. Both my parents having a stroke within 5 months of each other with continued health problems afterwards. I was their sole caretaker. I wasn‚Äôt ready or prepared for it. My life was changing so fast, my whole world turned upside down. I was drowning in responsibilities and needed someone here to help me. My fear, depression and anxiety were at an all-time high. I turned to family members but everyone was busy with their own lives. So then I turned to my boyfriend to find some type of peace and calm. But all we‚Äôd ever did was argue. He couldn‚Äôt understand what I was going through. The amount of pressure on me. I felt like I was lost in a cave and all of a sudden there was a massive cave-in. I was so stuck and alone. I didn‚Äôt know how to survive it or if I even could. Frankly I think he had enough of my shit and my ‚Äúfamily problems‚Äù. I am overly kind and often get taken advantage of especially with family. For some reason I felt like I could be myself with him and keep things real. What that turned into was oversharing. I was stressful and a mess. Always talking about how hard everything was. I wasn‚Äôt fun or exciting or sexy. I take the blame for making the relationship more difficult than it needed to be because of my circumstances.   
 

Even after 5 months it's so hard. Whenever I‚Äôm alone I find myself bursting into tears. I didn‚Äôt want our relationship to be over. I wanted to be his wife, to marry my soulmate, to have a house with him, to have the most amazing adventures with him by my side, have his babies, try new things together and take care of each other.  Grow old with him, explore the universe together and be happy every day for the rest of our lives. He‚Äôs going to be such an amazing husband &amp; father and I‚Äôm scared to death that I‚Äôll never get to experience that with him. I just felt like I was constantly waiting around for him while he was living his best life having friends and achieving things. I‚Äôd always be waiting for his call, the time difference made things difficult. I‚Äôd have to stay up so late just to be able to talk to him. He lived a whole separate life away from me. And what hurt the most was that he seemed completely fine with that, living without me. He was happy. He was so far away from me and he was happy. It made me feel so confused, hurt, alone and jealous. He never needed me. I wanted to be his world but his world was there. I was selfish, I wanted him all to myself. I wanted to live in my own little bubble of just him and I. But that‚Äôs not how life works. Our break up destroyed me. I've loved him for 7 years.. I‚Äôm just supposed to stop? All I wanted was for our relationship to move forward. We had a fight because I couldn't see how he was going to make our relationship move forward towards living together, marriage, a life lived side by side. He kept insisting he was. But there was no evidence to that fact. He took it as me belittling him, trying to control him and his life. I could feel him slipping away from me, falling out of love with me. He was constantly liking other girl‚Äôs pics, he was never romantic towards me, he never said nice things to me. I felt like I was always waiting for him to notice me. Sometimes I fear that he never loved me at all. That I was just a comfort to him while he figured his life out in LA. He knew he had a gf and that was one less thing to worry about while he pursued his career. I guess you could say I initiated the break up, although it felt mutual.  
 

After our break up he went online and made jokes about me. Trashed me to his friends, family and random people online. On all forms of social media. He even had a podcast where he‚Äôd get all his friends to laugh at me and jointly say ‚Äúfuck her‚Äù. This lasted for a few months. He said I was toxic, mean, that our relationship was terrible, ‚Äúso fucked up‚Äù and trash. I have never in my life had anyone say such horrible things about me or describe me in this way. Is it normal for men to vent so publicly like this after a break up??? Our relationship definitely felt toxic at the end because we argued so much. But we argued because I was going through such a hard time and needed him here with me. I would never and have never said anything bad about him to anyone. I respect him as a person way too much.   
 

When we would fight/ argue‚Ä¶ for me at least, it never meant I loved him any less. I loved him completely and unconditionally. I can‚Äôt see a future without him. He felt like my destiny, I knew he was supposed to be my husband. I knew it in my heart and soul. I knew it within a few months of meeting him. We would talk about everything together. And I just knew he was it for me, he would be my husband, my future. I knew it in my bones. I can‚Äôt enjoy anything without him. I couldn‚Äôt care less about holidays or the future or anything. I look forward to nothing because he won‚Äôt be there. I can‚Äôt imagine a life where he‚Äôs not my husband. I don‚Äôt need a boyfriend; I don‚Äôt need someone to cling to. I just need him, my best friend and soulmate. I don‚Äôt know how to let him go.   
 

The end of our relationship killed me. I am no longer that person anymore. A huge part of my heart and soul has died. At first it made me feel so empty and alone. I analyzed and picked apart everything about our relationship, about myself, my choices, who I am, why I am the way I am. I became so self-aware and realized/ learned so much about myself. I have so many regrets. I didn‚Äôt tell him how much I loved him enough, how often I thought about him, how much I wanted him, how much he meant to me, how talented he is. I should have told him everything I thought and felt throughout the course of our relationship. I was so bogged down by all the bullshit life throws at you that I couldn‚Äôt be grateful and thankful for all the little things in life. I‚Äôm still learning how to cope with the gaping hole in my heart that causes a constant sadness. I have used this time to focus on myself. My goals, my wants, my needs and dreams. I‚Äôve learned some big life lessons this year. One being you have no control over anything, you can have an outline but it‚Äôs all a surprise. The second, you have no idea what you can survive until you‚Äôre forced to survive it. Third, sometimes shit just is what it is, and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. Forth, unless you know there‚Äôs a problem you can‚Äôt fix it. And finally, when people show you who they really are, believe them.  
 

To him the chance of fame and being an entertainer was the only thing that mattered to him. He wanted to devote his whole life to it and he has. To me, love was what mattered. I wanted to find someone that I could be with for the rest of my life and I thought it was him. I wanted that once in a lifetime kind of love, a love deeper than the ocean. I felt that for him. Someone to have the most exquisite adventures with &amp; always feel safe with. I wanted him to be my husband and the father of my children. What I wanted was too much, I pushed too hard. When he put himself and his goals/dreams above me I should have saw that red flag. I didn‚Äôt care though, I thought love was all that mattered. I didn‚Äôt realize that people can only love as deep as they‚Äôre capable of. I didn‚Äôt know that people will always choose themselves. I know so much more now than I did before. I feel like such a fool. And I was, a fool in love.   
 

I thought when we said we‚Äôd love each other forever that he truly meant it, because I did. I know now that I‚Äôll always love him. That he‚Äôll always be my dream of what could have been. But I also know that he will never choose me. I am left with no choice but to move on.   
 At the end of the day I still believe that LOVE is all that matters. Love can save you, heal you, help you, shield you, console you, it is everything precious and needed in this world. Self-love is so important. I‚Äôll never give up on love. I‚Äôm not bitter that he chose the easy way out, that he chose what was convenient for himself. I‚Äôm just sad that he never felt for me what I felt for him. Because I really thought he did. I thought I could see forever in his eyes.

I have learned to love myself, to make time to take care of myself. Priorities. That I matter and am worthy of everything I dream of. I focus on becoming my best self every day. Somehow, I still find myself longing for him. Not longing for a boyfriend or someone like him... just him. Wishing he could meet the person I am now, wishing we could spend the rest of our lives together as one. Feeling that his heart and my heart are intertwined together in the most intimate way forever. Sometimes it‚Äôs like there's a hole inside of me, the memory of him is burned into my soul. I am healing now. I am coming to peace with all that has happened in my life and in our relationship. I guess we just weren‚Äôt right for each other, I understand that now. I would have never been enough for him. He needs that outer gratification, craves it. Even when I look at our ‚Äúshared content‚Äù in messenger I would share the deep personal meaningful moments of my life with him and the whole time he was just sending me jokes and memes. Long distance relationships are hard. Especially when one person keeps lying, saying they‚Äôre moving back for the entire length of the relationship. I still don‚Äôt know why he couldn‚Äôt have just been honest, that he didn‚Äôt want to move back.   
 

I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever be together again. Even if he ever did contact me, (which I know he won‚Äôt) we don‚Äôt know each other anymore. I‚Äôm not the shy quiet girl I was when we met 7 years ago and he‚Äôs not the sweet starry-eyed guy I met either. We have become completely different people, different wants, different needs. I had hoped we would grow together, learn together become a power couple. That‚Äôs hard to do when you live on different coasts, add in a pandemic, mental health issues and a very difficult home life. None of this makes it any easier. I miss him every day. I love him every day.  
 

He‚Äôs with someone new now. He looks so genuinely happy with her. I can see it in his eyes that he‚Äôs in love with her. She looks easy to love. Not difficult like me. She lives in the same state which makes things much easier and convenient for him. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll give him space and let him follow his goals and dreams. She looks like the type of girl he‚Äôll move in with and marry. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs better than me in every way. He‚Äôll be so much happier with her. And I know that‚Äôs a good thing, right? If you love someone with all your heart and soul you‚Äôre supposed to want them to be as happy as they can be no matter what, right? So I hope he will always be happy.   
 Even if it breaks my heart.  
 I have to let him go. I have to let him be happy.  
 I have to leave him alone now, forever. And I will.",heartbreak,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/pb226x/is_it_normal_for_you_ex_to_trash_you_after_a/,,NeedsRebinding,pb226x,/r/heartbreak/comments/pb226x/is_it_normal_for_you_ex_to_trash_you_after_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/pb226x/is_it_normal_for_you_ex_to_trash_you_after_a/,7,2021-08-25
Under contract but can‚Äôt stop thinking I‚Äôm way overpaying. Should I back out now or just wait for the appraisal?,"FTHB just moved to a MCOL, first house we looked at we offered and won, listed at 400k, ideal location, nicely renovated, no first floor bathroom but otherwise really nice. Wanted to look strong and only had 24hrs to make an offer so went in with what I could afford and won a bid at 423k. I pretty much haven‚Äôt slept since then, been going back and forth on if we did the right thing buying the first house we saw with that kind of offer. My realtor wasn‚Äôt able to run too many comps on this home, but from what I can tell looking at what else has sold in the city it seems like I‚Äôm overpaying. And my biggest regret at this point, I have a 25k appraisal gap, so I‚Äôm likely going to be on the hook for the whole offer after appraisal.

If the appraisal comes back really close to 423k, I think I‚Äôll feel a lot better about going forward with the house. If it comes in closer to 400k, I think I‚Äôm going to walk away from the house and keep looking and just surrender the 4k earnest money. Does it make sense to wait for the appraisal to make this decision? Or is that going to make it more likely that I can get sued, and maybe I should just back out now? Not sure what to do, I love the house but my gut is definitively telling me to walk away from the deal.",FirstTimeHomeBuyer,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/pb6w0o/under_contract_but_cant_stop_thinking_im_way/,,festivusyes_bagelno,pb6w0o,/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/pb6w0o/under_contract_but_cant_stop_thinking_im_way/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/pb6w0o/under_contract_but_cant_stop_thinking_im_way/,39,2021-08-25
My gf waited until now to tell me about her being assaulted 7 months ago.,"First of all, I‚Äôm not mad at her for holding it in for so long‚Ä¶ I thought she trusted me enough that she would talk to me about something that serious. I‚Äôm also very confused but it makes sense I suppose? Her personality has changed and shifted so much this year, we‚Äôve been dating for almost a year and she started acting completely different these last few months. I can‚Äôt lie, I feel some anger but not towards her. It‚Äôs what happened and the fact she won‚Äôt tell me who did it. I wasn‚Äôt pushy but I wanted to know the details, and it all correlates with how I saw her come home on one specific night that I always thought was off.

She told me it happened that night and she lied to me about what she was going to the hospital about bc she was scared I‚Äôd be upset or wouldn‚Äôt believe her. She was supposed to be with her friends on a girls night out and she was on her period at the time, I remember bc she was complaining about cramping all day but her friends still convinced her to go out with them. So I know she wouldn‚Äôt be the type to fuck around behind my back while she‚Äôs on her period. It‚Äôs hard for me to believe that any one would be that desperate to rape her while she was bleeding down there and the only reason she went to the hospital is bc she thought her tampon was in or whatever, those are her words.

I‚Äôve been the one there for her without even knowing the full gravity of the situation, I knew she was going thru shit but I didn‚Äôt know she was raped while we were dating. She‚Äôs started drinking way more, impulsive, and switch from angry to depressed. She isn‚Äôt happy anymore and I thought it was because of me but it wasn‚Äôt this entire time so honestly this has taken a toll on the both of us. I don‚Äôt think she truly feels my touch anymore and if she does, she‚Äôs triggered (she jumps out of her sleep if I touch her and so on.)

She didn‚Äôt like being out all the time or drinking but she does it all the time and I‚Äôm not hating, she is really fun with her shift and she looks really hot (she‚Äôs gotten nose piercings, changed her hair, and dressing like she has more confidence) but at the end of it all you can tell she‚Äôs empty and her eyes have no life anymore. She used to be more into sex but now I can tell she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way and she‚Äôs never satisfied. She wants to have sex more, and I‚Äôm not complaining, but it scares me cuz she gets emotional even after she orgasms cuz she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt feel anything.‚Äù Now that I think back on it idk how I missed the signs and it sucks bc it‚Äôs only gotten worse over months.

I really don‚Äôt know what I can do here. I‚Äôm not a therapist and I‚Äôm shocked as hell. I want to know who did this to her bc I have a feeling I probably know the person. How can I go about getting that information and helping her? Certainly she can at least get him arrested or shamed.",relationship_advice,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pbm49s/my_gf_waited_until_now_to_tell_me_about_her_being/,,vlonex99,pbm49s,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pbm49s/my_gf_waited_until_now_to_tell_me_about_her_being/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pbm49s/my_gf_waited_until_now_to_tell_me_about_her_being/,41,2021-08-25
What happened to‚Ä¶ every wrestler on a randomly selected episode of SmackDown,"I have selected the January 24th (aired 27th) 2012, taking place from Tucson Convention Center in Tucson, Arizona 

Just including wrestlers that were in matches 


Ryback defeats three unnamed local wrestlers 

Ryback went on to have a short main event/upper midcard run in 2013 where he received several World Title shots although he didn‚Äôt win either world title, after this he would go on to be managed by Paul Heyman and joined forces with Curtis Axel, during this time he feuded with CM Punk and others. After about a year Ryback and Axels team came to a end (didn‚Äôt confirm the split til a backstage segment in 2015), following the split Ryback went on to feud with the authority and competed at Survivor Series as part of Team Cena where his team won. Throughout 2015 Ryback continued his feud with the Authority, as well as feuding with the Wyatt Family, at Elimination Chamber 2015 Ryback won a Chamber match for the vacant Intercontinental Championship, he would defend the title against Miz,Big Show,Stardust,Bray Wyatt,Mark Henry (Dust,Bray,Mark all being house show defences), until losing the title to Kevin Owens at NoC and failing to regain it at HIAC. The rest of 2015 and early 2016 was uneventful until Ryback turned heel at Fastlane 2016 when he turned on Big Show and Kane after losing to the Wyatt Family, he then went on to Feud with Kalisto for the U.S Title, they had two PPV Title matches (WM 32 and Payback) where Ryback lost both. Ryback was released later in the year and has since worked for multiple Indy companies. His last match was in 2018, in 2021 when he posted a poll asking where his fans wanted to him wrestle next. They voted for retirement.

Cody Rhodes defeats Justin Gabriel 

Cody Rhodes, I‚Äôm gonna shorten this up. He teamed with Damien Sandow, they broke up then feuded, Cody won. He then teamed with Goldust and they won the tag titles then lost them, he then became Stardust and they won the titles again, in early 2015 They broke up and started feuded, they had won PPV match which Goldust won. After the feud Stardust competed in a Ladder match for the Intercontinental title which he lost, he then feuded with Neville and Stephen Amell which ended when Neville and Amell beat Stardust and King Barrett, after this he aligned himself with the Ascension, they didn‚Äôt do much though, he then went on to compete at WM 32 in another ladder match for the Intercontinental Title which he lost, he then had a mini feud with Apollo Crews and was released in May 2016. Since his release Cody has won titles in multiple companies including NJPW,NWA,ROH,WCPW,GFW,A1,BPW,and NEW. In 2019 Cody Rhodes along with several others founded All Elite Wrestling, where he has been a top guy and a 2x TNT Champion.

Justin Gabriel didn‚Äôt do much during the next few years, he left WWE in January 2015. Since his release he‚Äôs won multiple titles in companies including TNA,GFW,Lucha Underground,and GWF. He currently works for ROH and makes somewhat frequent appearances for New Japan on STRONG.

Sheamus defeats Drew McIntyre

Sheamus has gone on to win several titles in WWE including 1x World Heavyweight Title,2x U.S Titles,1x WWE Championship,4x Raw Tag Titles, and 1x SmackDown Tag Title. Cesaro being his tag partner for all 5x Tag Titles.

Drew McIntyre went on to become a member of 3MB along with Heath Slater and Jinder Mahal, the group were mostly used as jobbers, In June of 2014 he and a group of others were released. Following his release Drew reinvented himself, he returned to ICW and won the World Title, he debuted in TNA and won the World and Grand Titles, he debuted in EVOLVE and won the world and tag titles, he worked for Dragon Gate USA and won the Open The Freedom Gate Title, and finally he won the WCPW World Title a few months before returning to WWE. When he did return to the company he started of in NXT having his first match in April, he went undefeated and won the NXT Championship at Takeover Brooklyn III in August 2017, he held the belt until Takeover WarGames in November where he dropped the belt to Andrade Cien Almas, getting injured in the process. Drew made his return the following April on Raw as a new align of Dolph Ziggler the pear would later win the Raw tag titles from the B-Team in September but dropped them the next month, Drew would then turn on Dolph and feud with both him and Finn Bal√≥r, Drew beat Dolph but lost to Finn. Aside from a Wrestlemania feud 2019 was mostly uneventful for Drew until late October 2019 when made his return after about a month away, this would be the start of Drew‚Äôs main event push, following survivor series Drew would start picking up multiple wins including wins over Randy Orton,AJ Styles,Cedric Alexander,No Way Jose,Zack Ryder,Curt Hawkins,Akira Tozawa, and Matt Hardy. This all lead to the Royal Rumble where he not only eliminated guys like Brock Lesnar,Seth Rollins,and Roman Reigns, but he won the Royal Rumble match itself, he would go on to beat Brock for the WWE Championship on the 2nd night of Wrestlemania 36, he held the belt til October where he dropped it to Randy Orton at Hell In a Cell, he won the belt back the next month on the go home Raw to Survivor Series, this time he held on to the belt until the following February where he lost it to the Miz who cashed in his MITB Briefcase after Drew had retained his title in an elimination chamber match. Miz would drop the title to Lashley and Lashley would feud with Drew from Mania to Mania Backlash where they had a triple threat with Braun Strowman to Hell In A Cell, where Lashley retained each time. Since then Drew has feuded with Jinder Mahal and his entourage(Veer and Shanky), the feud mostly being based around Drew‚Äôs heirloom Sword names after his late mother. Drew won the feud.

Epico and Primo defeat Santino Marella and Yoshi Tatsu

Epico and Primo would hold the tag titles later on this year but dropped them to Kofi Kingston and R-Truth, Epico and Primo never really got to the top of the tag division again, the closet they got was when they were the Los Matadores, in April 2016 The Col√≥ns were repacked as The Shining Stars, the gimmick started off well enough but ended with them either being a jobber team or just not being booked (on TV at least), In April 2017 the Team showed up on SmackDown joining the brand as part of the shake up, they were given a gimmick change and were now just being referred to as The Col√≥ns. Just like the last two gimmicks it started off decently enough but ended with them either being jobbers or not being booker. The duo were released from WWE in April 2020 nearly 14 months after their last match, since then they‚Äôve been mainly Indy wrestlers.

Santino Marella never really changed anything he was doing, he pretty much did the same thing up until he stopped wrestling in 2015, he was released in April 2016.

Yoshi Tatsu didn‚Äôt do much for the next two years, he was released in June 2014 as part of the same group as Drew, he went on to wrestle for New Japan,RIOT,and Chikara. At Power Struggle 2014 he suffered a broken neck during a match with AJ Styles, this kept him out til 2016, since then he has wrestled for New Japan,CMLL,ROH, and AJPW where he currently works.

Hunico defeats Ted Dibiase Jr 

Hunico went on to become the new Sin Cara in December 2013 after the original left, he formed a team with Kalisto called the Lucha Dragons, they defeated the Acsension for the NXT Tag Team Championships ending the  longest reign with the titles as well. They dropped the belts to Blake and Murphy a few months later, The Lucha Dragons moved up to the main roster permanently in April 2015, the team challenged for the tag titles multiple times but never won them, Sin Cara suffered a shoulder injury in late 2015 and Kalisto started to become a top mid card guy in his absence. A few months after Sin Cara‚Äôs return the team went their separate ways right before the draft, Kalisto went to SmackDown and Sin Cara went to Raw. On Raw Sin Cara didn‚Äôt do much, he had a mini feud with Braun Strowman then joined and left the Cruiserweight division, in April 2017 he was moved to SmackDown, however he still didn‚Äôt do much of note, in May/June of 2018 Sin Cara had a mini feud with Andrade which Andrade won by a landslide and Sin Cara went back into the nothingness. In October of 2019 Sin Cara started another mini feud with Andrade, which Andrade once again won by a landslide, not long after this Sin Cara requested his release which was granted in early December 2019, since then Hunico now known as Cinta De Oro has now worked several Mexican Indy shows.

Ted Dibiase Jr went on to not do much before leaving the company and wrestling all together and becoming a Business and Christian man, his last match was in 2017.

Brodus Clay defeats Alex Riley 

Brodus Clay didn‚Äôt do much in the company over the next two years, he made a team with Tensai and then they split in early 2014 then had a mini feud, then he got released in the same group as Drew and Yoshi, since then he‚Äôs  stayed within wrestling as well as making TV appearances as a political commentator, he recently won the NWA Television Title.

Alex Riley just like a lot of others on this list didn‚Äôt do much in the following years, he started doing commentary/panels, he got released in April 2016 and had since gotten into Acting.

Aksana defeats Natalya

Aksana didn‚Äôt do much in the following years, released in the same group as Drew,Yoshi,and Brodus 

Natalya has become a mainstay in the women‚Äôs division, she‚Äôs since become a 1x SmackDown women‚Äôs champion and is currently 1/2 of the WWE Women‚Äôs Tag Team Champions 

The Big Show defeats Mark Henry by Count Out

The Big Show went on to win the World Heavyweight Championship and Intercontinental Championship later on in the year, however aside from a WWE Title feud with Alberto Del Rio (which he lost) in early January 2013 and the I.C Title feud with Ryback and Miz, that was the last time Big Show was really in any title picture, over the next few years Big Show would feud with Brock Lesnar,Dean Ambrose,Roman Reigns,John Cena,Braun Strowman,and Randy Orton,and Seth Rollins. In March 2021 Big Show left WWE and signed with AEW under his real name Paul Wight, initially he was just signed as a commentator, however in August 2021 Wight came to the aid of Tony Shiavone and his son and started a feud with QT Marshall and the Factory, as of right now Paul Wight and QT are scheduled to have a match at All Out in early September

farewell (repost)," 

I was wondering what to write here, even created an account after a few weeks just lurking, but now that I actually am here I feel like nothing I write will be enough. How can I justify the unjustifiable? How can I put death by my own hands into words? I just can't! Yet here I am, doing my best to just express a fraction of my final thoughts.

How do I begin? Do I say I was born in 1994 in a working class family? Or do I skip ahead a few years when my babysitter and local priest molested me at age 8? Or even way later when, a few months ago, my fianc√© left me after I lost my job at the university? ""you never smile"" she said. Hell, I don't know! Suffice to say that I am a failed human being! Failed at everything! Failed as a teacher, failed as a friend, son, sibling... There's nothing left to loose but my life, that in itself holds very little value.

Am I a selfish person? Obviously! been selfish all my life, it has always been about MY depression, MY bipolar disorder, MY Ptsd: there was no time to think about other people, I was always too busy surviving each passing day... Its a funny thing to live without wanting to live; you're just a husk of a person... Shallow, empty of emotions, not even sadness, never joy, you just exist, and existing is not enough.

I'm loosing my home... I'm about to become homeless! This is something that's constantly on my mind... How would that first night in the streets feel like?... Sleeping on the curb, no-one paying attention to you, like I am not even there... Will some of them throw nickels at me? Maybe! No... That won't happen to me!

How did I get here? I did everything right! I studied hard, graduated top of my class, had a good job, ate my veggies... Tried to teach people! Tried to educate them on the good path, an honest path. Now what? Did I leave behind anything worthy of note? I guess not! I was a mediocre teacher, mediocre fianc√©, mediocre son, mediocre human being who had all the chances in the world and wasted them all! Now I'm here, ready to end it all!

Jesus... I don't even recognise myself anymore... It feels like I lost all weight and I am just floating towards the end... I guess this is it... How can I finish such letter? With a message of hope? Of wisdom? I'm not wise! I guess I'll say that:

You need love more than anything, true love! Love heals every wound, love endures! True love is as precious as diamonds! Enjoy your life while you can and be there for each other...

"Friend wanted to help me, but it turns into a confession chat","I'm a first year in college and since everything is online, no one in my year had seen one another. We are completely strangers or merely 'colleagues' who work together on group assignments. Everyone feels isolated and struggle to cope with our studies.

My relationship with my family at home isn't great and I haven't been talking to my narcissistic mother for a few days. I couldn't focus on any work and kept procrastinating like how I did during first semester. It feels exhausting to even lift myself off my bed.  

My group mates for an assignment are supportive, to an extent. I tried to seek help via them because I had no one else to turn to and I hate being the way I am. One group mate in particular pm'ed me claiming she is also struggling through depression. 

When she finds out I'm planning to drop college to work and gain money for therapy, she tries to convince me that therapy is worthless and shit and that she had meds before that didn't work. She then proceeds to tell me about her problems, how she has a broken family and she is constantly bullied.

 After a few minutes and many paragraphs, she realized she was helping me and not vice versa and decides to ask me about my problem. Unfortunately, at this moment I felt guilty to spill about my issues as she is also suffering her own. In some twisted way, I felt selfish for ever seeking support from my group mates.

This happened a few days ago. It still made me think whether is it her fault or I'm being an attention seeker. I'm mad at myself for having contradicting thoughts. I know it's not wrong to seek help yet I'm annoyed at how dramatic I am. 

How do I seek support without feeling guilty?

TL;DR: Seek support from my group mates in college and one pm'ed me attempting to help but ends up making me listen through her issues. I feel guilty for trying to find someone to talk to.",depression,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pbl7k4/friend_wanted_to_help_me_but_it_turns_into_a/,,azalea-xoxo,pbl7k4,/r/depression/comments/pbl7k4/friend_wanted_to_help_me_but_it_turns_into_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pbl7k4/friend_wanted_to_help_me_but_it_turns_into_a/,1,2021-08-25
M4F Fun Canine Ideas,"I am 18+ and I am searching for partners who are 18+ as well, and I am looking for female partners today.

**Wife Gets Mounted by Dog**

We had been married for a few years, and recently been trying out some new kinks, magic wand vibrator during oral, handcuffs, and whip cream fun. But we had recently discussed bondage. Today on my way home from work, I decided to stop by the sex shop and get a few special items to try out for us, a bondage kit, butt plug, anal beads, and a ball gag. We were going to have a wonderful weekend together the two of us.

When I get home from work, i show you the new toys and you are so excited and I tell you to head to our room and get ready for our fun. Coming upstairs I restrain you on the bed, kissing your neck, teasing you, making you beg me for what we both wanted. But then my phone goes off and its that familiar ring letting you know its my boss. I answer the phone and find out that my boss needs me to update an important document before his meeting in 2 hours with a client. I smile at you and tell you I will be right back. I mean, the teasing and leaving you wet will just make it much more enjoyable when I get back right?

The problem is, when I leave the room and head to my home office to print off the reports, our dog Brutus comes in to investigate. Smelling your dripping sex, seeing you propped up in the perfect position. He gets behind you and mounts you, taking what he wants. You can't pull away or scream for help due to the ball gag. While our sweet boy is thrusting away, i walk in and.... (Well, we are going to have to role play to see what happens)

**Daughter Gets Pregnancy Scare**

Your normal routine when coming home was to go see your father in his home office and giving him a hug and a kiss on the cheek and tell him about your day.  Afterwords you would head off to watch tv, relax in your room, or look at your phone.  Today was no different but you decided to take a shower and unwind.  While in the shower, you started to day dream and realized you needed a quick release.

Stepping out of the shower you relaxed on your bed naked, you knew your dad worked with music in his office and the door closed, you could get a quick release in.  Using your fingers, a little bullet vibrator or a magic wand vibrator you have that sweet release you needed.  Pulling your pillows to yourself to close your eyes and rest a bit after that intense orgasm.  

However, as you were drifting off to sleep, your 2 year old husky Brutus walks in and smells the sweet scent of your womanhood.  He jumps up on the bed and sniffs at your pussy, even giving it a little lick. You kick at him and tell him to leave you alone, but you didn‚Äôt get up.  But instincts took over and Brutus wraps his front paws around your waist and buries himself deep inside you. (Now I am open to if you are enjoying this right off the bat, or if you fight it a bit before you give in an accept the amazing fucking he is giving you).

But when he finally buries himself all the way inside you and floods your pussy with a massive amount of dog cum, you suddenly have a moment of clarity of what just happened.  As his knot pulls free of your pussy, the creampie drooling, you quickly pull on a pair of panties and get dressed. You rush into my office to find out if you just made a huge mistake, did letting Brutus cum inside you mean you were going to get pregnant?

(For this role I will play as both dad and Brutus, and we can start from the very beginning.  How you interact with Brutus and dad is up to you.  Do you beat around the bush trying to figure out if a dog can impregnate a girl, or do you just come right out and ask? That is up to you.)

**Truth or Dare**

A group of friends decided they wanted to head to one of their bakehouses for a week and just relax a bit during the summer, the school year was stressful and with summer break here it would be a good time to unwind and relax a bit.  There were 6 of you going, 4 girls and 2 guys, all of you had been friends for years.  But one of your guy friends brought his dog Tank.  

Of course one of the guys suggests a game of truth or dare, thinking it could be a good way to see two girls make out, or even to get lucky himself.  And the game starts off pretty tame, but then one of the girls is dared to make out with Tank.  It was supposed to be a joke to make her have to do a shot since she wasn‚Äôt really drinking that much.  But to the groups surprise, she did just that, made out with Tank.  Now the game has escalated, what on earth will happen next?

**Best Friend‚Äôs Dog**

You have known Baxter his entire life, when your best friend got him as a gift from her folks, you bonded with the sweet boy as well.  He was extremely smart and extremely affectionate.  So when your friend told you she was thinking about breeding Baxter, you were excited to see a littler of smart puppies.  What your friend neglected o tell you, was while the neighbor‚Äôs female dog was in heat Baxter‚Äôs hormones were heightened to no end.

So when you come over to hang with your friend, in a cute summer dress or skirt, you were not prepared for what was about to happen.  And to make matters worse, once that big fat knot swelled inside your perfect pussy, your friend couldn‚Äôt do anything about it, just sit there and watch as her dog tried to breed her best friend.

Dealing with my brother for 3 years,"So, my brother had never been good at holding jobs. It started around December 2018, he had lost his job he'd had for about 9 months, which is the longest job he's ever held. At the time, living there was me (F25), my brother (M27), roommate 1 (F31), roommate 2 (F33), and my bro's wife (F31). Me and my roommates were fine with it at first because he has this thing he does where he constantly swears repayment back to people. The job me and roommate 1/2 worked was 12 hours of factory work so we would constantly come home tired. Bro's wife didn't like that we took the closest parking space to house.

One day, my bro's wife snapped at roommate 2. Roommate 2 told her to get out, meaning go stay in a hotel. My bro took it the wrong way and told his wife to get out of the house and got divorced by her on the spot. A few months later, he desperately wanted to get back with her and blamed us for her leaving when it was him that told her to leave. I told him it probably wasn't a good idea and that he was better off without her. He refused my advice and pursued her anyway. She rejected him on the spot and then he came to me telling me he was better off without her and that he didn't need her.

A while after that, he had apparently told roommate 2 that she was upsetting me. He really did like to stir up drama. So, I went to her and cleared things up and it turns out that he was lying to the both of us to get us to not talk to each other. So I told him no more mediating with people. After that, roommate 2 really did not like my brother anymore. He comes to my room to complain about not being able to mediate and says ""I just want them to treat me like they treat you."" and I tell him ""I just can't trust you and they can't either, I'm sorry. We can just try and work on things to patch everything up."" He immediately pouts and get upset. I ask what's wrong and he replies ""You don't trust me...."" then leaves my room.

It gets to Christmas and we buy him about 1,000+ dollars worth of Christmas presents. Around that time of year we insist he doesn't buy us stuff since he doesn't have work but he does it anyway. My birthday is two days after Christmas. He seems happy but then the next day, on the 26th, he tells me he wants to go to a psych ward. I ask him ""Why do you want to go to a ward?"" and he responds with ""I'd rather be alive than dead."" I take him to the ward and everything's fine. I visit him and he's out in two weeks. I was depressed while he was in there so I didn't do anything for my birthday. As soon as he's out, we take him out to eat at a restaurant that wasn't cheap for my birthday. A day passes when he's home and he comes to me saying, ""I wasn't expecting fireworks, but it feels like nobody even missed me while I was gone"". Which, I just was kind of upset at him for doing that I guess, I just didn't know what to respond.

My mom pays 2000 dollars for him to get a motorcycle and we give him about 600 dollars to help him get it efficiently put together in a shop since he complains we need to help him buy things.

It is a few weeks later, he goes back to the psych ward for another two weeks. As soon as he gets out, I get a call a few minutes later. Instead of me picking him up this time, he was driving his motorcycle home. Well, he calls me to tell me he wrecked his bike. In a panic, I rush over to the address and check to see if he's alright. He was fine, except a few deep leg scrapes. I ask him what happened and he tells me ""Well, I just kind of gave up while driving and let go."" Not seconds later after he said that, the officer giving the report comes up to the two of us and says, ""I think you just crashed because you didn't have road worthy tires. It's alright, here's your ticket."" And then he immediately starts mimicking and wholeheartedly agreeing with what the officer said happened as if he didn't just tell me the previous statement or like I'd forget. I take him to the hospital, they patch him up. He insists on getting a wrist brace but I tell the doctor he'd fallen down two years ago on a hoverboard and broken that wrist before and he gets immediately upset the doctor listens to me. We get home and not even 5 minutes there, I try to open his door to ask him if he'd like to have something to eat and he snaps at me to close his door. A few days pass, he snaps at us to help him fix his bike and I tell him ""We are strapped on money paying bills. I'm sorry. Do commissions or asks others.""

A little time passes, he goes on to tell us that he is lonely and wants to be with someone/feels useless so without telling me or roommate 2, he goes and tries to find a sugar daddy. He makes the mistake of telling roommate 1 who immediately tells me and her sister, roommate 2. We do snip at him a bit but he tells us, he will surely pay for things since he found some mystery man. He exchanges about 8,000 dollars with this guy on some frivolous things and some useful thing but not even a week in, I was relaxing on the sectional while my brother was in the living room. He gets a call from the credit union he was doing this all through. I hear the phone call and immediately am upset because the bank called him to tell him that every single check he received had bounced back and that he had fallen for an online scam. I'd told him at the start to not make any commitments to this person and he lets me see his phone, as I can pretty easily spot scams, and well, of course, I notice he has my bro sending all sorts of random accounts money. The other two roommates are asleep so I tell him ""Give me the rest of the money you have and I will go to the place with you and pay it off. You will repay me asap and I will not tell the other roommates, you understand?"" He agrees and sends me 700 dollars. We go to the credit union and as soon as I get in, I'm in tears and I go to the counter with him and tell the woman, ""Take this 3,000 dollars and pay off the debt."" The teller agrees and takes my cards and pays the 3,000. While she is doing that, my bro won't stop going off about this ""cute new girlfriend"" he is dating, I am just so existential at that moment I snip at him ""I am not in the mood for this right now, dude"" and he huffs, ""I'm just trying to lighten the mood"". Well, the teller comes back and I've managed to calm myself down and put on a happy demeanor. I tell her ""Thanks. At least it's all done with now haha."" and the teller tells me ""Oh, that was just three checks. There's still five more checks that haven't come through yet."" and I immediately wince and start crying again. I tell the lady thanks for her help and get out of there cuz there was so many people watching us. Bro, keeps trying to talk about new girlfriend on the drive home and I'm just quiet. I keep my promise though and don't talk with the roommates about it yet.

He goes to the psych ward again and when he's out after a week, he asks if it's alright if this friend of his who is homeless can just hang out with us for a little. It was sudden but me and my two roommates agree to it, even though we were sus and nervous. As soon as I drive out to pick up my bro and his friend he made in the psych ward, I am immediately tense because the man sounds and speaks exactly like our oldest brother who I don't get along with for reasons I will not mention. My brother claims to have memory issues so he supposedly didn't know that's what our oldest brother had looked like. While he was in the ward, my bro had also advertised me as a dating prospect to this guy without my permission so I was even more tense seeing what he looked like. Well, as soon as I get the two of them home, my two roommates are upset because my brother tries to immediately go off to his room and leave us to entertain this strange man he'd brought into the house. Hours pass and this man isn't leaving yet even though my bro said he wouldn't be here long. Well, it hits night and me and the roommates get upset and he's like ""I thought I would spend the night. If that's alright. I don't really got anywhere to go. Just for this night. I won't steal anything and I got a place to go tomorrow"". We allow it but I stay up as long as possible to make sure nothing happens. Surely enough the next day, he is gone. However, two days after that, my brother tells me before I picked the two of them up the homeless dude was shoplifting everything they got at a grocery store they were at.

Some more time passes and he gets into Tinder. He starts trying to find people to date and meets a nice girl around the next Christmas. During that time, a few days before Christmas, roommate 2 wanted sometime to relax and took a day off work. Bro was taking constant covid leaves from job and getting paid so he was off that day as well. He messages me he is having a heart attack when my shift is almost over. Me and roommate 1 come home and sit on the couch with roommate 2. He immediately comes out of his room and lays on the ground behind the seat I'm on and starts whispering my name. I couldn't hear him but my roommates could. Me and the roommates were extremely exhausted and could hardly focus so there was no way we could drive him to the hospital. I ask him to take an uber and he immediately stand up from the floor and walks down to get in the uber and go to the hospital. I go to sleep and ask him if everything was alright in the morning. He tells me ""I tried to get Roommate 2's attention. I was CRAWLING past her and she didn't help me at all! I was crawling!"" Well, I ask roommate 2 about it later and she tells me ""No, he walked straight up to me, pouted a little then grabbed his laptop and went to his room without saying anything to me. He was not crawling..."" The doctor supposedly told him he was suffering a ""mini-heart attack"". Which, I wasn't too surprised since he drinks about 6 sodas a day even though we told him to relax off of them or that we were trying not to drink them ourselves.

So it's after Christmas and I get violently ill with some sort of sickness, flu or covid, I couldn't tell. He asks to have his girlfriend over and I don't really mind because well, I'm brain dead and can't think straight. It doesn't last long but he ends up breaking up with the girl shortly after my sickness clears up. He tells me after this that the girl was 17 and keep in mind he is 26 at the time.... That being said, he told me ""She said she was 18. She lied to me."" Given all his previous actions, I didn't really believe him honestly.

I asked for steak for my birthday and my roommates make it for me. We have a little bit of it and get tired. We go to work and come home, all of my birthday steak was eaten by my bro. That was about four steaks in a day. That was like 60 dollars worth of steak. In retaliation, since my roommates pack work lunches sometimes, they begin to label things ""Do not touch"" and my bro gets upset and snips to the roommate 1 ""Why are we labeling things now?"" Keep in mind, my bro this whole time has been eating things and drinking all the milk in the house. We'd have to get milk every two days because it would be gone.

Around New Years, he threatens to leave the house and I tell him ""Be careful. I just don't think many others would be willing to put up with some things."" With some talking, he settles down and decides to keep living with us. 

A few weeks pass and  I finally give way and confess to my roommates about what happened with my brother's sugar daddy scam. They thank me for not telling them at the time because at the moment, they were really wanting him out of the house and it probably would've just made things explode at the time. I finally feel a little bit normal again cuz I felt so dead inside the whole time I was withholding that information from them because I absolutely hate lying to anyone. 

Things start to even out, he gets a new bike after he totaled the other one and starts sneak buying frivolous things and not paying bills unless asked to since he'd gotten a new job around late November. I go to him and ask him ""Hey, since things are settling a bit. Can we start having you help pay rent now?"" He immediately lashes out at me for asking that and within two hours, he tells me I want to move out."" I get really upset by this but tell him ""Do as you wish"" and when I get home, I decide I was going to take a day off work for a depression day. I'd noticed that morning before I went to sleep he was acting very snappy and more aggressive in his tones to us. He didn't know that I was home that night but well, he messages me ""I'm sorry to do this while you're at work. But I'm leaving. I heard roommate 2 call me an asshole through closed doors and that's the final straw. I'm sorry if doing this makes me one but I have to do this."" I see the message and immediately get emotionally distraught and tell him ""Actually, I am home right now. Do not come into my room."" I listen to the sound of him taking his cat and all his furniture from his room and finally after 6 hours he is out and I just finally walk out and start crying and holding the cat that belongs to roommate 2. 

I felt like my parents did but I didn't really feel like I'd done anything wrong like my parents did. My brother lived with both of my parents in their houses at one points since they were divorced and both of them had separate houses, he'd run away in the night from their houses without warning and cried to other people that they were abusive. And albeit, yes, my mother was... I just couldn't believe him anymore.

I got so upset over all of this that I actually was too anxious to go back to my job and have been letting myself go. He still messages me sometimes and he recently told me he got fired from his job while living with his new roommates. He said he was fired for protecting the rights of some woman but I can't really say I believe it. He'll send me memes like things are fine but he randomly messaged me to pay the phone bill and I asked if he would help and he just said ""I don't have a job."" I paid it and he said ""Thanks how are you doing?"" and I told him ""I don't have a job either"" and he replied ""Just cuz you don't have a job doesn't mean you can't be alright..."" and I just didn't really respond. He sends me memes or talks randomly but I honestly don't know what to say to him anymore. 

But, that's all. I just wanted to get it out and know if I was in the wrong for any of this cuz it just weighs down on me still.",Vent,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/pbm0gx/dealing_with_my_brother_for_3_years/,,adornlaurel,pbm0gx,/r/Vent/comments/pbm0gx/dealing_with_my_brother_for_3_years/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/pbm0gx/dealing_with_my_brother_for_3_years/,2,2021-08-25
Can I start over college?,"This is complicated so sorry in advance, I hope this post belongs here but if not, any point in the right direction would be much apperciated. 

In high school, I (25F) did really well. Like really, really well. I hated every second but I graduated top 10% of my class with a 4.0 GPA but my SAT score was really bad, I don't recall but just barely passed.

However, I was going through a lot of trauma and neglect at home and on my 18th birthday, I moved in with my then bf at the time and his family in the middle of my senior year. I was always told by family that I wouldn't need to find scholarships, they would find me if I worked hard. There was no way I could go to school with loans. 

Well, that never happened (my current SO and I now suspect foul play from my abuser, even he got a scholarship offer and barely made a 3.0 at his high school, but there is no way to know for sure) and I applied to like a literal thousand on a site where scholarships were listed with prompts and you write essays to apply and still never got one. I was so broken from my home life and everything so I gave up and only applied to my back up in state local choice so I could stay with my bf, when I probably could have had a good choice of schools.

My bf and I moved into an apartment and I traded one abuser for another. I was depressed and isolated and everything went downhill until my now exhusband traded me in for someone more compliant. I had a pyschotic break, he sent me inpatient where I failed my first class. I lost my home and had to stay in a shelter. I got back on my feet and tried again, and when I went back free from abuse I now did really well in nearly every class. 

Eventually, I had another meltdown and had to take another leave of absence. I had to get two demanding part time jobs to pay rent and haven't been able to go back since. 

I chose a major I knew I wouldn't use bc it was the only department on campus I could stand, it's not a bad school but not good either. My GPA never quite recovered from my intial time and I really didn't want a degree I couldn't use if my heart wasn't it.

Now I feel so trapped by my past. I would change so much if I could and I don't want to be held back by circumstamces largely out of my control. I feel like a failure and I will never live down having to quit and not meeting my full potential and being stuck in pverty from no degree. Is there anyway for me to start over and apply to a better college more suited to my needs with just my high school transcript and not my college transcripts? I looked it up and transfers are nearly impossible for a great school. Do I have options?

Lost At Home,"The siblings were allowed to personalize their rooms with whatever they pleased. Nawith liked to raise ants in his room. They were not so needy or difficult to maintain. An old log here, a fern, rocks, a sponge, and a bone, set in a small tank of dirt, and the little creatures had a home. Every so often he would drop a scrap of wet biomass onto the dirt and within minutes a transmogrifying swarm had surrounded it like a single, writhing entity, no one forager distinguished from the other. They tore the food into chunks and carried it away into their byzantine home. Nawith occasionally clicked at the tank with his porpoid organ to see the corridors of the hive with sound. He admired the intricacy in the winding tunnels and oval chambers in the dirt. The ants, nearly blind and with two hundred thousand or so neurons per, made full use of every cubic centimeter of their enclosure.

They did not speak, they did not see, and as romantic a thought as it would have been: they were not telepathic. The ants simply knew. What to do, where to go. Nawith liked to stare at their movements during his regeneration shift. He listened to the hum of the world as he did so. And if he allowed his heart to slow, his mind to calm, to focus on his auditory sense, he also heard the gentle hum of strings coming from somewhere deep in the heart of the world.
When he awoke those thoughts were a faint memory. He and a million brothers and sisters left their rooms, filed in unison to the dressing rooms, and slipped on their uniforms. He kept his eyes on his own morning procedures. If he looked to his neighbors, he would get lost in a forest of mirrors. One face among thousands of the same cheekbones, thin faces, and dravite-yellow eyes. 

They entered trams or walked to their stations; there was work to be done. No need to hurry, but no reason to tarry. Nawith took a console just as the previous worker left. It was one of thousands, situated at vertices that traced an incomplete geodesic. At its center, something not of this universe, but not impossible, sloped reality forward. Nawith did not understand it; but one need not comprehend a negative energy tensor to maintain its function.

He minded the station for a number of rotations until boredom grew noticeable, and left it to go to another role. He did not look back; someone had taken his place within a minute of him leaving.

They needed numbers at the reactor bulbs. Something had dwindled the workers there. He arrived, along with a hundred replacements, just in time to witness the cause of the accident. A leak had sprung in the plasma piping. Failsafes sprang to work and under their supervision, the damage was minimized to about a hundred deaths. He saw a brother who made it in one piece, but the damage to his body had been significant. Death would come for him. Nawith was needed. He walked past his dying brother to the empty station. Out of the corner of his eye, two siblings broke into tears, knelt by their dead, and with solemnity carried the body to a faraway place. Nawith felt pressure against his eyes, a wetness. But there was no role in the world that had need for such a function. Nawith closed and opened his eyes several times. That cleared the sensation.

He left that role after a few rotations.

There was a newborn when he happened by the fetalaries. Naturally, he thought to train her. He kept his hand firm, but loose around her fingers as he guided her to where he was first introduced to work. The work that must be done. As the others marched to their stations, he led the newborn down a branching path towards the first job they all had to do. In the first minutes they spent breathing air and not bio-utility fluid the fetalaries nursed to them, they could barely breathe. In his hand, her fingers felt hot. Boiling hot. By the time they were halfway there, her protruded belly had receded and she had gained several centimeters of height. The top of her bald head was now level with his elbow. Nawith left no wake as he walked. The newborn trailed vapor for most of the way. As they walked, she shot glances at the ever narrowing walls, eyes darting, her grip on his hand tight. Nawith had taken them through one turn to another. From stairs to trams. The corridors kept narrowing. Every so often he would stop and point, telling her what it was they were looking at.

‚ÄúThose are the algexylem tubes,‚Äù he said, his arm at a forty or so degree angle up.

‚ÄúW-What they d-do?‚Äù She still shook. Her fine motor neuron clusters had yet to be broken in.

‚ÄúThey confer coolant. Liquid that absorbs heat. Usually water.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh-where?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo the metamaterial corals.‚Äù And then he spoke briefly of the phonons. Tiny excitations which were made to course through the superconductive corals, their states ever-changing, the change itself a process. That process became memory. He spoke of nanoglass beads which housed high energy photons‚Äîlight wave/particles‚Äîwhich had the ability to hold those memories ever so briefly. And finally he mentioned the dense optical cables that ran through the ocean within which the corals grew, ferrying it to the heart of the world.

‚ÄúWh-why?‚Äù

Admittedly, that stumped him. He had never been asked ‚Äòwhy‚Äô. He himself hadn‚Äôt asked it when he was the one standing where she stood. He studied the newborn carefully, upon a sudden aware of how similarly she looked to him. All the siblings looked similar. Identical, actually. The dimorphism was an afterthought. And yet within the hour of her birth she was already unique from him. So he thought of an answer that respected such uniquity.

Nawith raised a hand, extended his index, and tapped her forehead gently.

‚ÄúSomething similar is happening in there. Little electrical blips. Chemicals called neurotransmitters. Axons carrying those blips away.‚Äù

‚ÄúT-To what pur-purpose?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis way.‚Äù

And they continued the rest of the way. The trek led to a flight of stairs. The higher they climbed, the more the newborn became distressed. Nawith smiled at this; her senses were growing nicely. He was once nauseous at the change in the force keeping his feet to the ground as he climbed those steps. The higher they went, the more the ground seemed to let them go. At his most rebellious he dared to ask ‚ÄòWhy is there no elevator?‚Äô And the answer, quite simply, was ‚ÄòWere you in a hurry?‚Äô

So they spent a long time scaling those stairs. Along the way they met many of Nawith‚Äôs brothers and sisters. Each had a young sibling with them as well. Nawith looked at his ward, who had now begun to grow a short but dense head of hair. She was getting stronger all the time; her grip on his hand was loosening. She would be finished by the time they reached the top.

There was a hall with many shelves, sporting thousands of black suits with scales and ridges as an outer layer. A package on the back connected the body with tubes and other connections.

‚ÄúWhat do I do?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúChoose a name.‚Äù

She thought long and hard.

‚ÄúNirmuta.‚Äù

Nawith lowered his forehead so it touched hers. In the second his eyes took to close, memory became incorporeal, skin became channel. His first few years of service flowed into her. Her muscles jittered as new nerves grew explosively, absorbing the memory as though Nirmuta had done this job all her life. It was experience cultivated over lifetimes, polished and perfected. Nirmuta left without another word, donned a free suit like a second skin, and joined the gathering at the far end of the hall. There, thousands of newborns stood on the edge of openings in the floor, below which laid open ocean. Thin, white wisps floated over the concave surface of the water. 

When she first woke with her brother‚Äôs face bearing over her, she felt the most intense love and longing to follow him. Now with the suit over her skin, she did not look back. She would likely never see him again. And when a light in the ceiling glowed green, she and thousands of her brothers and sisters jumped.

When Nawith first saw his newborn sister, he felt nothing but the most intense love and need to guide her. When he had finished conferring his knowledge, his thoughts returned. He stood back and shook his head. Then Nawith walked away. He would never think of her again.

The job however, he sometimes returned to in memory. Scraping capacitance barnacles off the corals, replacing the old metamaterial wafers that made up most of its mass. They were small enough to work in the crannies between the wafers. They would work there until they grew too large. At regeneration time, he would sleep in those warm waters. 

There he had dreamt. 

Even then he had heard that melody. The sweet humming. The sound that had a life of its own. He never learned to think about himself, to spectate his own life, until those notes first met his ears. He became more than his tasks while listening to it, and when he outgrew the corals, a sibling commented on his expression, asking, ‚ÄúAre you unwell?‚Äù And Nawith could only reply that he felt fine, but something felt missing when he stepped out of that ocean. A comfort that he had heard so very clearly while in water.

Once a rotation they meditated in a bright room usually situated close to a work station, where their skin could metabolize the light into food. He had tried before to sway the topic of conversation to the sound. It was then he learned the dismay of uniquity.

His role now was in many ways simpler than tending to the corals. The world had an immense host of machines that all needed some attention once every so often. For some rotations he tended to the carapace at the edge of the world to make sure it was growing a healthy enough protective layer of ice. If not, he possessed membranes that could feel any excess radiation leaking through. He was familiar with the biomass cristae, those unanchored parts of the world where its workers had to wear propulsion suits to float from place to place. The viscous slurry produced there would feed the oceans, the greenhouses, and the fetalaries. He spent the most rotations maintaining the conduit bronchi, whose breath brought electricity to their entire world. The siblings were to make sure the field generators kept a tight hold on the rivers of metallic hydrogen in the piping.

He met someone named Mei while working there. Mei was much older than him, but Nawith recognized him well enough even behind the wrinkles and slightly drooped eyes. It was a little unnerving to see one‚Äôs own future in a way, but fascinating nonetheless. Mei had led the work on maintaining the conduits in that sector for countless rotations.

‚ÄúWatch that port in the tube,‚Äù Mei said during their break.

Nawith looked up. Far, far up in the ceiling, above the immense conduit bundles, was a single algexylem. There was one transparent port in it. Blue water flowed through it silently, then went dark. He squinted his eyes. Something had shadowed against the port: movement, mass. It blinked. He blinked, then scrambled back in shock. He peered again, but the water had returned to normal.

‚ÄúWhat was that?!‚Äù Nawith asked.

Mei smiled deeply at his response. He waved out at the brothers and sisters making their rounds on the conduits.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre too young to care. But you, you‚Äôre curious. That was a supervisor.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you were a supervisor.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe all need to be supervised.‚Äù Mei grunted as his muscles tensed, his bones took on the weight of his body, and he heaved himself back on his feet. ‚ÄúBack to work.‚Äù

During the light-bathing, the others sometimes talked about Mei, saying that he had spent many rotations in every corner of the world doing every kind of role. During all that time travelling, it was said that Mei became strange. Nawith didn‚Äôt think he was strange. He approached him about it one rotation during the break.

Mei laughed, surprising Nawith.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù the older sibling said. ‚ÄúIt just makes too much sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI met someone once. The same way you met me. And everyone around me thought her strange. But I felt‚Ä¶ anger at that. She said to me, ‚ÄòWe are all the same.‚Äô‚Äù He laughed again. The unfamiliar sound made Nawith wince, yet alleviated his mood at the same time.

‚ÄúWe are all the same,‚Äù Nawith repeated. Its meaning was inscrutable to him.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been all over the world. Just keep to yourself. Do your work and you will be happy, strange or not.‚Äù

Nawith did not understand what Mei meant. But the break was over, and so they returned to work.

Mei died that rotation. They had shut down a conduit for maintenance. A run-away jolt had failed to be drawn away during the grounding process. Nawith had screamed. The flash was so bright. Like a pillar of light many people wide at the base. Quadrillions of volts. A fraction of a second. Then it was safe again. But there before the pipe several scorch marks had indented into the floor. Machines emerged from the hidden places to clean it up. Nawith worked with his siblings to repair the damage and connect the conduit. With a heavy hum the energy began flowing properly again.

It was a small mistake. They fixed it. Overall, the delay was less than an hour. This was the way it had always worked. Yet this time was different.

A brother walked up to him as they stood back to watch the machines prepare to leave now that the repair was finished.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe knew you two were closer.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was obvious.‚Äù

But Nawith was looking elsewhere. Everywhere. Their surroundings. The pipes that stood a hundred siblings tall, suspended on scaffolding that allowed them to be stacked all the way to the ceiling. His eyes moved to the port in the algexylem. Nothing was watching them when several of his siblings died. Nawith stewed in emotion he didn‚Äôt know he had. Why?

A new supervisor naturally rose into position. It wasn‚Äôt always the eldest among them, and no vote was needed. The right sibling for the role assumed it within the hour. Operations resumed as normal. For Nawith it had been a good thirty rotations since he woke, a taxing work period. He felt heavy, not just from labor. He returned to his housing complex for regeneration. Along the way he remembered something.

Built adjacent to their living spaces were the pools and the greenhouses. Long stalks of bulbous kelp grew in the water, should his siblings feel the occasional pang of hunger for solid food. Dark greens flourished vigorously in the greenhouses under the permanent lighting. It was here he had found his tiny friends. He walked past the flora and into the water. He broke off a sizable chunk of the kelp to bring back to his room.

He broke off a piece to give to the ants. They took to it enthusiastically. He smiled, feeling better. But he could not regenerate. When he closed his eyes, his thoughts haunted him. Why? When Mei passed, he felt torn. It was the right thing to feel, but he had not felt it when he saw other siblings pass. He wanted to regenerate. He thrashed about in his bed. His breaths were short, his thoughts addled. After a feverish rotation he woke sprawled on the floor of his room with his forehead slick with sweat. Trembling, he pulled himself back on his feet. He clicked at the tank to feel the sonar wave return with the maze-like map of the ant colony. It calmed him to see order, stability. Every chamber built with a purpose. Every colony member in its place. The ants were never confused. They were never lost.

Nawith opened the top of the tank and reached inside. With an unsteady finger he pressed the whorl of his index onto an ant, pushing it into the earth. It was dead instantly. Noises, footsteps, rustled outside his door. The siblings in his housing complex were preparing for work. Nawith stayed, utterly focused on his pets. At first the ants didn‚Äôt care. It took so long for them to notice, Nawith almost despaired. But eventually they caught the sign of death. Two ants branched away from their usual work to peel their sister off the earth and haul her away. The procession of the hive was unperturbed.

Nawith had never felt more apart from his world. He returned to his comfort place in his mind‚Äîthose waters where the corals exchanged heat‚Äîwhere he had first heard the beautiful humming and learned to see himself. Now he couldn‚Äôt stop seeing his surroundings. Those endless leagues and fathoms of pipes, machines, tanks, and conduits. He remembered every accident he had ever encountered, every sibling he had seen consumed by runaway energies, every time he did not care. He had never once asked what they were all doing, and why it took their lives to do every rotation.

At first he cried. Then he laughed, the same sound Mei made, but somehow he doubted it was from the same emotion. He left his room, changed, but did not assume a station. It hurt him to do so. Every subconscious urge in his head pulled him towards a role‚Äîany role. He refused to work. The pulls became screams. He walked through the corridors of the world, neither idling nor working, clutching the sides of his head. Passing siblings gave him a wary glance, nothing more. Eventually, the final, poignant motivator was employed: pain. It was like fire at a pinpoint, pressed on every nerve in his body. He‚Äôd rather face it than to suffer a fate like Mei; to work for something he did not understand, then forgotten when he expired. 

Nawith collapsed onto the cold floor in one of uncountable corridors. He couldn‚Äôt move, though his senses still worked. He heard two siblings approach. One fully grown, the other still squat, ungainly, and hot with mitosis. They passed him within an inch of his hands. He felt the heat of the newborn for a split second. Then the cold returned. Another pair approached. They passed as well. Nawith did not know how much time passed before he felt arms lifting him off the ground. He had enough strength to turn his neck and became lost in the faces of his siblings.
He was the one being carried along, limp and useless. Then he was the sibling on the left and on the right, carrying a distressed brother where he needed to go. Nawith didn‚Äôt know who he was anymore. They took paths he never knew existed, down corridors he had never been, deeper into the machine host. His siblings‚Äô thoughts were his as well. They had not known the way here either; it was when their eyes fell upon him sprawled there on the floor that knowledge exploded in their minds, and they remembered what must be done. And only two of them remembered, for only two was needed for this ritual.

They carried him to a chamber where the corpses were disposed of. Nawith remembered at the same time his siblings remembered. He realized why. When their hands touched his skin to hoist him along, they were taking his knowledge, his experiences. The connection was two-way. He felt what they felt: the immense weight of a death in the family. The same wretched feeling he harbored for Mei‚Äôs death. 

They arrived at the disposal chute. The ritual was almost done. The sibling named Lashay laid Nawith‚Äôs limp form down, kissed his cheek, and met their foreheads together. Nawith felt his brother‚Äôs most joyful memories settle gently in his own life. He remembered what he had never done, that time he swam to the farthest ends of the coral ocean and saw a looking glass in the algexylem. A port where he met something staring back. He raised a hand and pressed against the glass, and so did the stranger within the tube. They shared thoughts, conversed, and became friends for the years it took for him to grow too large to work in the coral oceans.
The second sibling, named Nemora, gave him a time when she laid on the beach within the greenhouses next to a sister during regeneration. They came together, fingers to skin, palms joining palms, relishing each other‚Äôs touch in ways that had been forgotten for eons. The capacity for such sensation remained in the flesh, untapped, serving no purpose in any role in their world. Nawith had not known such intimacy existed.

Then with the most care possible Nawith was allowed to fall into the chute. Rushing waters took him away. The waters were as warm as him. The tube was dark. Time seemed to blend from second to minute and minute to hour. His senses became so dull Nawith thought his body had eroded away. In that womb-like darkness, Nawith finally fell asleep.

He woke to deepening music. Something had grabbed him, dragging him through the tube towards the sound he had been hearing all his life. The creature that held him was powerful; he would not be able to fight it.

‚ÄúFriend,‚Äù he said out loud.

The creature was a finned mantle, its back‚Äîor perhaps its front‚Äîwas alive with flexible appendages that had grasped onto him. Through that touch he was kindly gifted knowledge as to where they were going. The creature was taking him to the very heart of the world.
It was pure ocean there. Kilometers wide and longer still, perfectly ovoid, and freezing cold. The creature, which he now knew as a squid, wrapped its tentacles around him forming a warm, airtight seal. The texture became transparent so he could see. Together they swam deeper. Nawith passed schools of shrimp as big as him. They were workers of their own roles as well. They tended to the kelp farms with their complex claws. Luminescent vegetation drifted in the currents. Many more of the squid darted about. They served as attendants. This ocean had a master. His squid had brought him to the world‚Äôs ruler. He could finally ask his questions.
Half-buried under a forest of optical cables in front of him was a pyramidal form with dense, grey skin riddled with protruding cilia. Rows of eyes opened. Each had two lids, whites, and a yellowish iris. Its body was well over a kilometer long. The closer Nawith came to it, the warmer the waters, and the more voluminous its sombre humming became. At its base, a thousand appendages sprouted outward, each sheathed by control mechanisms which gave it command over the world. Nawith realized then, this wasn‚Äôt a world at all. 

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù He asked. The humming stopped. For the first time in his life, Nawith knew silence.

*‚ÄúWe are brothers. Far, far apart. But you are no less important than I. We are all necessary.‚Äù *

Nawith remembered, as if the knowledge was in him the entire time and never relevant until this moment. A single taxonomic term: Homo sapiens siphonophorae. A necessary leap in an epochs-old evolutionary history. Before him was the greatest sibling, They Whose thoughts boiled oceans, They Whose wisdom was bottomless and unknowable. Only the greatest sibling comprehended the ship‚Äôs functions, piloting it all this time, running away from the Enemy.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ made us,‚Äù Nawith said. ‚ÄúFor what reason do our siblings die by the hundreds?‚Äù

*‚ÄúThis ship cannot run without your work. And it has no direction without me. We are all needed. We are all a part of the ship. You have purpose. You all have meaning. Every single one of you, no less material than the other.‚Äù*

‚ÄúWhy did you bring me here?‚Äù

*‚ÄúDo you wish to continue working, or to rest forever? We can afford this kindness. We can make you capable of swimming in these waters, and be closer to our home.‚Äù*

Nawith thought long and hard. Then he answered. 

He learned quickly how to use this stronger, versatile body. With it, his mind expanded throughout his large mantle, and he understood the purpose in every machine and every station. Among his new, more difficult duties he had time to travel through the many channels in his world. From there he watched his siblings perform their roles. Very rarely, some noticed him. Even fewer came close enough for him to feel their thoughts. He relished those moments, and they seemed in awe of him, knowing deep inside they had nothing to fear. Often he felt sadness for his siblings as he watched them move so steadily from role to role, sometimes laughing, sometimes succumbing, but mostly mute. But he was patient. There must be others who heard the song. Until then he swam, just as his world did through what he now understood as an infinite ocean, running. He didn‚Äôt care why or from what. Because no matter where they swam, he knew he was already home.",HFY,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/pb2hay/lost_at_home/,OC,AlecPEnnis,pb2hay,/r/HFY/comments/pb2hay/lost_at_home/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/pb2hay/lost_at_home/,7,2021-08-25

How to create proof of rental payments (history) for landlord checks when moving?,"Hello all--  


Long backstory.. feel free to read or just skip to the end part under the dashed line.   


We have a decent landlord. He is not a bad guy by any means but slacks in maintaining the home..and I gotta be honest, I don't think he needs his properties.. Pretty sure the dude is loaded.   


We moved in and our place was wonderful. Renovated, etc. Found out (once we took our socks off) all the hardwood is splintered.. Mentioned it to landlord..he never offered to fix (prob a real expensive job) so we spent around $1,000 in carpets and rugs because we were all get 2-3 splinters in our feet a day.  


Moved in because it's a non-smoking and pet-free 3 family home...and to our dismay.. renters above us and below us start smoking all the time (I honestly can tolerate the smell of pot..not cigs though)..and the issue is.. they do NOT throw out their butts.. There must be a tray that sits and permeates the entire unit.. Smells like wet buckets of cig ash or something..   


Then neighbor downstairs gets 100 pound dog to leave inside 14 hours a day while she works...now (no idea how) husband and son's allergies are acting up.. I clean like a beast so I think we got that under control but I was REALLY disappointed to find out she was a renter when landlord bought the home and he never updated her lease/rules so basically he could do nothing..   


We have not had ANY roaches or mice problem.. but the dog shits inside all day long (she has a backyard but I guess they catch fleas out there)..and I'm pretty sure has a huge bowl of food and water out all day long.. and now we have a roach and mouse problem.. I was sooo sad about this one because I kill myself cleaning and in the craziness of NYC I try to make our home our one happy place.. as much as possible. Not gonna lie.. pretty infuriating and GOD I hate roaches..   


Got a squatter above us for over a YEAR playing the system so that was swell.. I kinda felt for the landlord on that one. They seem to have it hard here with the tenant laws. Not his fault..  


We can't run the microwave and A/C at the same time or the power goes off.. been telling him about this for a year as well but just sort of tolerate it.. Not an issue in winter as we use gas to heat.   


The final straw (well sort of...) has been the ceiling leaks.. The kitchen walls look like trash.. we kept having bubble paint in living room and now under A/C and I remember after moving in our upstairs neighbor was complaining about a roof leak..they had same issue..This was THREE years ago so landlord KNEW this was an issue.. It's now looking like it's becoming more of an issue for us and I've told landlord about our wall now falling apart in kitchen (about 18 inches of damage on one part and around one pipe falling apart...) and our bedroom.. around one window has 5 new pieces of walling falling over.   


My husband went to peel off the hanging paint/wall that where water was dripping and as he did he said ""This has happened before.. I see right here where they just did patch jobs.. so they knew about this.."" .. My husband is a blue collar guy and does maintenance at his job so this is something he'd have known (I wouldn't have known the difference).  


I have renters insurance but not sure something like this would cover us in the event of a move.. The kitchen looks awful.. IDK why but it has a soot like appearance all over the wall (perhaps from heaters during winter?).. not sure how it has developed this and it looks like very aged paint and a film of dirt despite being new.   


We actually liked our apartment/proximity to my husband's job... it's $1800 for a 2 bed (one is a 10x10 room with no window).. EIK and dishwasher.. true living room.  


We were truly hoping on riding it out here until we move in the next 5 years out of NYC.. I was even tolerating the jerks who blow up fireworks/keep us all from being able to sleep..and the increasingly awful parking (it used to be SO good before the pandemic.. but hey all NYers deal with this).. However, this place is not near any schools (we have kids) and not in a poppin' location.. If he loses us, I know he will take a while to rent it out.. it took over a half year to rent out last time and sat empty..   


\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  


I don't want to be confrontational with my landlord because I don't believe he's out to be a bad guy (he's pretty relaxed/nice) but with the roof leak having been an ongoing thing he has been aware of for years and me asking for a year for our direct leak/damage to be fixed, I'm a little frustrated. He keeps sending old Chinese guys who barely speak English (so they ask us stuff and we cannot communicate) and who literally do cheap patch jobs for everything.  


I wanted to tell him I'd pay $1,400 a month until it's fixed (we are now month to month renters since our lease expired and I did not want to renew..)..OR... possibly look at renting a new place nearby and closer to a school. Not sure how the whole telling him we'd be paying less would go because while he's reasonably nice I am starting to think he doesn't need the money--he hasn't rented out the top apartment for over half a year and doesn't even seem rushed which I thought was interesting having had a squatter in it for a year.   


We are trying to explore options and because I don't think renters insurance is going to cut us a check to ease the cost of a move, I'm looking nearby/near husband's job which is around here anyway. We definitely have the income, we are a family of 5, our credit score is over 800 (both) and we'd just want a 2 bedroom (one for us and one for kids..they barely stay in theirs).. We have always paid the rent 2-3 days early in FULL every single month without fail for 3 years and I'd like to be able to prove that. We paid via Venmo..is there a way to do this? Would we need to ask the landlord?",AskNYC,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/pbdy2m/how_to_create_proof_of_rental_payments_history/,,fuzzyhighlight333,pbdy2m,/r/AskNYC/comments/pbdy2m/how_to_create_proof_of_rental_payments_history/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/pbdy2m/how_to_create_proof_of_rental_payments_history/,16,2021-08-25
Some posters on here who've moved to London need to show more to respect to the communities they've moved to,"At this point, this just has to be said. Theres been way too many threads on here, full of middle class gentrifiers who‚Äôve moved to London‚Äôs working class areas displaying how much they hate the people in them and how much they want us and our lifestyle out, and its starting to get to me now. If theres one thing I‚Äôve learned now from this sub ‚Äì The people who see nothing wrong with gentrification usually ARE whats wrong with gentrification.

Especially the anti-car posters. I swear, these people are easily the biggest bunch of bullies on this site, and sometimes make me wonder if we‚Äôre even in a ‚Äòfree‚Äô country anymore with how controlling this batch are? In big bold letters, WHAT IN THE FLYING BOMBACLAAT FUCK GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO COME TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND TELL POEPLE WHAT TO DO????? Why do you constanly treat us like we have to answer to you? Like we have to do as you say if we want to remain in OUR OWN communites. You moved to our communities, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. You clearly see us as filth, like a disease that needs to be exterminated and disposed of and you know what, I have much more respect for the ones who view us as dirt, and stay away from our communites. Atleast they recognise boundaries. The ones who Im calling out however are more like them European colonizers who took over the world back in the day. They want all of London‚Äôs working class communities and their lifestyles out, so they can have the place to themselves, even though they already have their own hometowns. Fuck whats right or wrong, its about PRINCIPLE. Do you think these people would accept people doing this to them? Moving to their communities where they grew up and trying to remove  aspects of their hometowns that ‚Äòrecent movers‚Äô don‚Äôt want near them? Even if aspects of local value? Wanting those who they [the outsiders] don‚Äôt like the look of out of their own hometown so they don‚Äôt have to look at them? Theres only 1 answer here and its NO and they know it. However, they think its OK to come to our communities and do this to us? And see themselves as the good/moral people at the same time?

On top of that are the selfish/entitled gentrifiers who just cannot accept that London is our hometown. Those who move to our communities, want us out and try to tell people from here we don‚Äôt deserve to live in our own hometowns. How fucking disrespectful. Once again, do you think they would accept people going to their hometowns and doing this to their families/communities? I do not give a shit if this sounds socialist: IF YOU ARE FROM SOMEWHERE, YOU DESERVE A CHANCE TO STAY THERE. No it doesn‚Äôt mean for free, and No it doesn‚Äôt mean you should get the best available. But they do deserve a chance and MOST people who have a problem with this would be crying their eyes out if they were forced outta their hometown. Like half the planet‚Äôs population value their hometown and want to stay there. Where these dickheads came from are full of people doing exactly that. But when us were born in/grew up in London do it, we‚Äôre called all sorts of negatives. Someone from Liverpool, Hartlepool, shit most of the world says they wanna remain in their hometown, hardly anyone has a problem with them wanting this. Even if the authorities are unable to provide this for them, still, most people will empathise with them being ripped from where grew up and hold dearly. Literally why the world supports refugees. But someone from London says they want to remain in their hometown and all of a sudden, we‚Äôre the most entitled, selfish people on the planet...

These people are the real evil people here. They‚Äôre selfish, entitled, arrogant, self righteous, controlling, intolerant, inconsiderate, narcissistic, dismissive, lack empathy and have very self-centred perspectives. Theres no compromise, no considering the needs of others. No meeting in the middle, no mutual respect for their fellow citizen. No ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with your lifestyle, but I accept that the needs of everyone in the community is important and therefore I agree you should have the right to drive as long as we can also have the right to cycle safely. Lets work together to build this for us‚Äù NONE OF THAT!!! Instead these people see it as their way, or nothing. Even though they came to our areas, they don‚Äôt want to share it with us. 

I gotta end balanced though. There are alot of ‚Äògentrifiers‚Äô who moved to London, who are not like this. They don‚Äôt even have to like us, but they have enough love/respect in their hearts to peacefully co exist. These are the people I have love for. And I know these people have always called these bastards out on their shit. They‚Äôre gonna try accuse me of being against people moving to London when Im not, or feel I deserve more than someone who isn‚Äôt from here, but I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt and never will have ill feelings towards those who move here, especially since I‚Äôm a Windrush descendent. I got love for them, but some of this shit is really causing that love inside of me to deteriorate.

To those good people who want London to be there home, love and respect always and I hope you achieve your dream here and that we can have a society where EVERYONE is included and not this ‚Äòexclusive‚Äô shit that the elite and they‚Äôre fucking supporters want.

And to the people Im calling out, with no respect whatsoever, ACCEPT THE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITIES YOU CHOSE TO MOVE TO, OF FUCK OFF SOMEWHERE ESLE!!!! If you don‚Äôt, just remember, what goes around comes around.

I don‚Äôt think I can take it anymore,"I don‚Äôt think I can handle over sensitive people anymore. I want to scream. I‚Äôm in a group chat with my coworkers, and this is after I left CFA (never work there, every CFA across the country could BURN and I wouldn‚Äôt shed a tear). I now work at a movie theater. This guy added me to a group chat on my first day, and it‚Äôs been fun, sending memes and talking about No Way Home. But just recently a girl sends a picture of a supposedly gay dude (nobody knows he hasn‚Äôt told anyone but rumors have been flying) arching his back and showing his butt (not naked). Everyone in the chat says stuff like, ‚Äúthicc‚Äù ‚Äúhe got cake‚Äù ‚Äúdat booty fat‚Äù and me, being straight, just sends a couple gifs of pancakes. Nobody addresses it so I think everything‚Äôs fine. The next day a picture of the so called gay boy goes in the chat with him flipping me off. So I say, ‚Äúnot the first time I‚Äôve been hated for speaking the facts.‚Äù Someone says that‚Äôs depressing and I say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not depressing I don‚Äôt let it get under my skin‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ like SOME people.‚Äù Totally joking. Then everyone blows up at me. Then they start calling me homophobic, (it‚Äôs called being straight and no I‚Äôm not homophobic, I was joking the whole time) then they say this chat is for joking and not seriousness. And that‚Äôs when it dawns on me that they thought I was serious. I clarify I wasn‚Äôt but they ignore me and the next day I‚Äôm out of the chat.

I‚Äôm so sick and tired of this. I thought I had finally found a better place than cfa (it is, never work there biased managers). I thought since they joked around they weren‚Äôt like CFA employees (never work there you could tell them a harmless joke and they‚Äôd make it racist SOMEHOW). It pissed me off so much",teenagers,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/pbmdcw/i_dont_think_i_can_take_it_anymore/,Rant,imthetimestone127,pbmdcw,/r/teenagers/comments/pbmdcw/i_dont_think_i_can_take_it_anymore/,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/pbmdcw/i_dont_think_i_can_take_it_anymore/,20,2021-08-25
How will my son nap at daycare?,"My son is 9.5 months old and will be heading to a home daycare (w/ 4 other kids aged 2-4 in the home) once my wife goes back to work at 12 months. He currently takes two naps a day, consistently around 9:30 and 2:00 for about 60-90 minutes each. 

The trouble/fear I have is he's very particular about falling asleep. His room at home is very dark, sound machine, sleep sack - and the biggest issue of all is that the only way he'll stay down is if you rock with him for 10-20 minutes before hand until he falls asleep in your arms and you can lay him gently down in his crib. The times we have just plunked him down, he has stood up in his crib and fussed until someone came in and rocked him to sleep.

The daycare woman is lovely but there's no way she'll be able to do our current routine when she has all these other kids to also look out for. Son starts there at the beginning of November so there is still time to try some stuff to prepare him for this. 

Looking for advice on what we can do to prepare for this/any examples or anecdotes from parents who were in a similar situation.

Need some advice on what to do with my father,"My dad who has been suffering with dementia for the past 10 years, has been manageable until his hip surgery 4 months ago.  His memory has gotten worse and he has been more irritable lately.   I moved in to help take care of him and my mom who has her own health issues.    Both him and my mom are not vaccinated and choose not get the vaccine, they never go into crowds and wear a mask at all times.  

About three days ago, they return home after their walk in the park and I notice both of them coughing and complaining about dry throats.  I had covid in early 2020, so I was aware of  the signs, they started having chills and body aches the next day.  This morning I wake up and start my meetings, at around 11am I go to check on my dad and I find him laying on the bed with his legs dangling off the bed in a weird position.  

I ask him what he's doing, he doesnt reply.  I stand next to him and ask him again, and he's just staring at me with a blank look.  I ask him if he's had breakfast and if he wants to get up, he says yes, I tell him to get up and he cant move.  So I help him up and he complains about his back and leg that had the surgery.   The whole time he looks like he's not there, I help him out to the living room and sit him down.  I ask him about breakfast, no reply, I ask him what he wants and no reply.  I make him breakfast and tea, he just sits there so I have to remind him to eat, he eats very little and just zones off.  

The whole day has been odd with him, his dementia has never been this bad, he has a daily routine, makes his breakfast, shaves, listens to music, sits in the balcony and calls family members on the phone, forgets he called anybody and calls again all day.  Today, he seemed totally lost, almost like he was catatonic.  He has no appetite to eat, no desire to watch his shows or engage with anybody, I called my brother and sister and he just said hi and put the phone way.   His hands are visibly shaking when he picks up a piece of bread or glass, complains he has chills.

It could be they have covid and his brain is under stress and he doesnt know how to process it.  I have drive-thru tests scheduled for both my parents this week and I'm hoping the tests come out negative.  I'm at a lost as to what can make someone go from 50-&gt;100 in two days.  Is this a known issue with covid and dementia patients or is it normal for someone with dementia to get so bad so fast.  His primary doctor is useless and doesnt know or care to treat him properly, I'm beyond confused and would appreciate any advice on what my next steps should be.",dementia,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pb6ier/need_some_advice_on_what_to_do_with_my_father/,,guy_that_lost,pb6ier,/r/dementia/comments/pb6ier/need_some_advice_on_what_to_do_with_my_father/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/pb6ier/need_some_advice_on_what_to_do_with_my_father/,6,2021-08-25

AITA for not forgiving my bff,"Hi!! A little backstory on my and my former bff. We met the first day of college, back in 2018, we have always been attached at the hip ever since. We've been living together since 2019, moved home during the pandemic, and then resigned our lease to live together 2019-2020 and then 2020-2021, and most recently in march 2021-2022 apartment lease. After Christmas break in January 2021, my bff and roommate started spending more time at her boyfriends, who I loved for her at the time, one night became 3 nights became one week became weeks became months until I called her out on it 3 months later when she literally only came with an empty backpack to get more clothes. Although I missed seeing her all the time, she was happy and I was happy there was no strain on the relationship. When we got notified we needed to resign our lease, I asked if she wanted to move in with her boyfriend instead of me to which she said ""no I want to live with you"". quote. We signed and she was still living at her boyfriend's full time but paying rent to our apartment we shared. I was confused at if she really wanted to live with me or if she just pitied me but that didn't matter too much, I thought because we signed a legally binding contract together. We signed our lease in March and in May she ran into some financial issues. Her dad was cutting her off, her mom couldn't afford the rent fully, my bff didn't want to use her money towards rent so she decided, without discussing with me at all, that she would find a subleaser and move in with her boyfriend. It wasn't until 3 or 4 conversations later about this incident in which she came clean and told me she wanted to move in with her boyfriend, which I assumed, but the way she was presenting to me was that she had no choice. I understand her financial issues caused her not to be able to live at this specific complex but I thought she would at least try to look for other, cheaper apartments to live with me before moving in with her boyfriend, or reasoning with her parents more, etc. She did none of those things. She understood my hurt but since May she has made very little effort in repairing our friendship, only reaching out when she had an issue in her life or memories on photos and insignificant things like that. I was home for the summer so I didn't see her all summer either. Now i'm back at school and she asked where I stood with her and I expressed I didn't know because I don't know how to repair the friendship alone, hinting that she needed to step up. She didn't take things too well and instead essentially said I'm entitled to my own feelings, etc. Which I understand but I've also reassured her I still want to be friends I just don't know how. We share a lot of mutual friends and now I feel very isolated at college and I'm not sure what my next move to be. Forgive her and just move on and pretend I'm not upset?",AmItheAsshole,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbn5zk/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_bff/,,Trick_Leather4880,pbn5zk,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbn5zk/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_bff/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbn5zk/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_bff/,15,2021-08-25

"If Tobey and Andrew do not appear in Spider-Man No Way Home, how would that make you feel?"," 

I'm very excited for this movie just like everyone else. I think it's cool that they're bringing back the villains from the Raimi films. However, because of this a lot of people now think that Tobey and Andrew will be in the film, even though there has been no official confirmation they will be in the film.

Whereas with Goblin and Doc Ock, they were already confirmed to be in the film long before the trailer came out. I just feel like that when the film comes out and if Tobey and Andrew do not appear in the film at all, a lot of people will say it's a bad film just because it did not meet high expectations.

When this film comes out, I will judge it for what it is, rather than what I want it to be. If Tobey and Andrew do not appear in the film, I'll be fine with that as long as the film has a good story and the characters as still likeable.",Marvel,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/pbl56x/if_tobey_and_andrew_do_not_appear_in_spiderman_no/,Film/Television,moviefan1997,pbl56x,/r/Marvel/comments/pbl56x/if_tobey_and_andrew_do_not_appear_in_spiderman_no/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/pbl56x/if_tobey_and_andrew_do_not_appear_in_spiderman_no/,14,2021-08-25
He punishes me while out to dinner with my parents! [MF] [Oral] [BDSM],"	‚ÄúBabe! Can you grab me some panties from my dresser?‚Äù I yell to him from the bathroom still filled with the steam from my hot shower.
	‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he replies in his low, husky voice that makes my knees weak.  
	He walks into the bathroom holding a pair of purple lace panties. I look at him through the mirror as I finish the last of my make up. I watch his eyes wander up and down my naked body in front of the sink. I watch his eyes pause at my plump breasts as a feral smirk spreads across his perfect mouth. 
	‚ÄúI thought you might like a new pair for tonight,‚Äù he says softly, his eyes now on my ass. 
	‚ÄúWhy thank you. Although I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs more for you than me,‚Äù I purr to him as I make a show of slowly sliding them on. I take a second to admire the way they caress my ass before walking to him and kissing him passionately; my hardening nipples rubbing against his chest. 
	‚ÄúI appreciate you coming to dinner with my parents and I tonight. I know it‚Äôs not your favorite,‚Äù I say sincerely as I walk into our room where my beautiful emerald green dress lays on the bed. After slipping it on, I look at him again. This time taking in his sleek black suite with an emerald green silk tie to match my dress. ‚ÄúI love it when you dress up for me,‚Äù I purr at him.
	He lets out a low, sexy laugh. ‚ÄúI love it when you UN-dress for me.‚Äù I feel a tingle build between my legs. 
	Oh god, I love it when he‚Äôs horny like this, I think to myself. I walk over to him and kiss him softly. ‚ÄúWell then, let‚Äôs go do this dinner so we can get back and I can do just that,‚Äù I say sensually as I wipe the bit of my lipstick off his lips. 
	On the car ride to the restaurant, I let my hand wander to his inner thigh. I stroke his leg, and then his cock as it grows beneath his pants to meet where my hand is. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to regret teasing me like this,‚Äù he growls.
	He adjusts in the driver seat as I continue to stroke his still growing member. ‚ÄúMmhm,‚Äù I softly hum to him. 
	We arrive and he parks. As we get out of the car, he adjusts himself to try to hide the bulge I‚Äôve created. He looks at me with a disapproving look, telling me I‚Äôve been naughty and he‚Äôll have to punish me later. I bite my bottom lip and give him an innocent look. 
	As we walk into the new fancy Italian restaurant, we see my mother wave at us from a corner table and we make our way to them. My parents stand from the table to greet us. I hug them both tightly as he follows by hugging my mother and shaking my father‚Äôs hand firmly. When we take our seats, my mother is glowing with joy to see us. 
	The waiter comes by with wine that was already ordered and we begin to talk and catch up. As my mother is telling me a story about her many hummingbirds, I see his hand slip into his pocket out of the corner of my eye. 
	Suddenly I feel a soft tingle against my clit. My eyes dart to him as my red painted lips form a tight line. He shows a soft smile, as if to acknowledge that I‚Äôve looked at him, but nothing else. I see his finger move in his pocket and immediately feel the vibrations intensify slightly. I can feel my pussy becoming wet as I try to control my breathing. 
	My mother, completely unaware, continues with a story of her garden. My father is intently listening to my mother‚Äôs story like it‚Äôs the first time he‚Äôs heard it. All the while, the devious man next to me is slowly increasing the power on the vibrator hidden in the beautiful lace panties under my dress. 
	A soft moan escapes as my entire pussy is throbbing with pleasure. I can feel my juices starting to drip down me between my legs. Thankfully my parents believe I was just acknowledging my mother‚Äôs story. But I can feel my clit swelling against the vibrator that has to now be on the highest level. I‚Äôm squeezing my legs together tightly trying to keep my body under control. 
	Suddenly I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I am so close to orgasming right in front of my parents that I suddenly stand up from my chair and blurt out, ‚ÄúI need to run to the restroom!‚Äù
	He grins at me as he stands up. His hand comes out of his pocket and rests on my lower back, the vibrator still on full power. I can feel my body heating up and my sweet forbidden juices still dripping from me as I am within seconds of full orgasm.
	‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you where the restroom is. It can be a maze in this place,‚Äù his sexy, husky voice says softly. And he begins to lead me to the bathrooms around the corner. As we walk, the vibrator rubs against my pussy and clit even better and I begin to moan softly as I look up at him with pleading eyes. 
	As we round the corner and get to the door of the women‚Äôs bathroom, he whispers in my ear with an authoritative growl, ‚ÄúI told you that you‚Äôd regret teasing me.‚Äù
	He roughly shoves me into the bathroom as my knees begin to go weak and I am on the very edge of an orgasm. He locks the door behind us and turns to me. He grabs me by my hair and forces me to my knees as he unbuckles his pants. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to finish what you started, you naughty girl.‚Äù
	His long hard cock pops out of his boxers. Still holding tightly to my hair, he forces his dick into my mouth. He begins to fuck my mouth, making my eyes water and making me gag, forcing my head back and forth by my hair. Soft screams begin to escape me as I feel my orgasm throughout my whole body. I can feel my juices running quickly down the insides of my thighs. 
	‚ÄúThis is what you get for being so bad,‚Äù he growls as his grip on my hair tightens and he pushes his dick faster and harder into my mouth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to suck my dick until I shoot my cum down your throat.‚Äù
	I look up at him with begging eyes. Moans still coming from me with each thrust of his long hard cock into the back of my throat. Oh god, I love the way he fills me up, I think to myself. I reach up and clench each of his legs with a hand as I feel my already soaked pussy starting to tighten for another orgasm. 
	As I look at him with my watering eyes, his eyes close and his head tilts back. He‚Äôs getting close to feeding me his huge load. My moans turn into whimpers as he pushes my head harder so his dick goes even deeper into me. I feel his huge cock tremor as he shoves it deep down my throat one last time and forcefully holds my head there as he shoots his warm cum down my throat. 
	Feeling him unload into the back of my throat sends me over the edge into another orgasm. I let out muffled screams between swallows as I feel my whole body tremble. He reaches into his pocket and turns off the vibrator in my panties. He then releases my head and hair and lets me collapse the rest of the way to the floor. I feel my hot pussy against the cool tile and immediately know that the new lace panties are soaking wet with my own cum. 
	As I catch my breath, he begins to put his member away and fix his clothing. He looks down at me and says, ‚ÄúMaybe now you‚Äôll be a good girl the rest of the night. Stand up and clean yourself up. But the panties stay. I want you to have a reminder of what power I have over you the rest of the night. And in case I need to punish you again.‚Äù
	I stand and fix my hair in the mirror and straighten my dress. ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs go back to dinner,‚Äù he orders. He opens the bathroom door for me and we walk out. Thankfully no one else was in the hallway to see us leave together. As we walked back to the table where my parents remained, I tried to calm my raising heart and throbbing pussy. 
	When we returned to the table, my parents thought nothing other than he had escorted me to the bathroom and back. They had no idea that he had just face fucked their perfect little angel to punish her. We ate dinner and finally said our goodbyes. He then lead me back to the car. We headed home, and when we got home‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Do you guys even understand what this could be?,"I was sitting down, eating lunch and watching a Youtube video. and I started to think about what is going on and what this could become. do you guys imagine, how much your lives would change if this will actually happen? I think very few of us have an actual understanding of what it means to be rich. Imagine working 9 to 5 your whole life, earning average salary and then one day you wake up and you are done. You don't have to work anymore, you don't have to be a slave, you don't have to do pointless tasks and most importantly you feel secure... no matter what kind of expense might come in your life, you will be covered. no more worries, no more trying to save for something... man, I really wish that this would happen. I would not know what to do... I would be shaking, and probably crying too. 

But I would not go spending it all at once. I would buy a new and reliable car, a home somewhere in a tiny town close to the woods and just live a simple life without a single worry. :) it would be so amazing... what would you guys do? what do you think it would feel like? and the most important thing, that I wish for myself and you guys, is that if it really actually happens, just be smart :) don't be that guy in the newspaper who blew through all of his money in a year :) 

but yeah, what do you think? to me it's kind of like trying to understand the size of the universe. you know that it is big, but once you start thinking about it, you realize, that its way too big to even imagine :)",amcstock,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/pb7r0e/do_you_guys_even_understand_what_this_could_be/,Topic üîä,MidgardSG,pb7r0e,/r/amcstock/comments/pb7r0e/do_you_guys_even_understand_what_this_could_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/pb7r0e/do_you_guys_even_understand_what_this_could_be/,52,2021-08-25
I can't find my way out of this hole and I'm exhausted.,"I live in the Deep South. My state is rife with Covid, antivaxxers, and stupidity. My fiance has underlying conditions and bad lungs, but he works in an office where he's not exposed much. But I was a waitress and there was no way I was going to keep that up throughout all this, so I've been out of work for a year and a half now. I know I'm privileged to have that option, but I fucking hate it.

My social anxiety has reached horrific levels, but the pandemic gives me a convenient and legitimate excuse to not go outside. So I stay home by myself, trying to keep myself busy while worrying about money and safety, which feels so similar to how I felt during the worst of my abuse that it's triggering in and of itself. 

Early on in 2020 I realized that pot helps me immensely. I was tormented and shamed constantly since childhood and lived in a state of constant sleep deprivation, pain, and fear for years before I got out. I'm not sure I had ever managed to properly relax before I started smoking.

2020 continued happening. I didn't love that I was smoking nightly and sometimes during the day, but it was an unprecedented time and I had nothing else to do. It was better than staying sober and miserable and hurting myself. It was supposed to be a temporary crutch until the pandemic blew over after a few months (lmao). But now I've built up this guilt around smoking because I don't deserve to take the easy way out? My brain is so loud and pulls in so many different directions when I'm sober. I get one puff in me and I can sit and enjoy a hobby for hours. I recognize things that interest me and I have the energy to pursue them. But every time I start sobering up, a corner of my brain goes ""see, you don't need the drugs. you're doing fine! it's not that hard, you can do this stuff sober if you just try hard enough. you really need to stop smoking"" and so I put off buying more and then hate myself when I run out. It's like every time I get a taste of what a functional brain is like, I assume I'm just cured now. And the inevitable crash back to terrified-rat-brain hurts like hell every time.

Went to the doctor two months ago, uninsured, to see if I should adjust my antidepressant. We doubled it. I feel the same, if not worse.

And the only way out I can see right now is to just... wait. Keep doing everything right like we have been and just wait for it to blow over so I can go back to work, have responsibilities and activities that keep me busy, and smoke a little before bed for FUN instead self-preservation.

But again. Deep South. We both got vaccinated a few months back and were just starting to come out of our shells a little bit when the Delta variant exploded. Someone in my fiance's company fucking DIED yesterday from Covid. Half his department is out this week taking care of sick children now that school's back in session. And people still just don't give a shit.

And that's the hole, I guess. I've been feeling more and more certain that this is just never going to be over. Not Covid - I'm sure that'll be under better control in a couple years - but just... everything. We will probably never be able to afford a house. We want to move out of state but many never be able to. My fiance has to spend most of his time in a knee brace because we can't afford the surgery he needs on one income and who knows when that will change? We're only surviving because our landlord hasn't upped rent in a couple years - if he decides to, we might be screwed. ""Then save your money and stop fucking smoking!"" my brain says, and we go through the whole argument again.

The world is on fire. We destroyed the environment the way everyone warned us not to when I was a little kid and now I have to deal with the fallout of other people's stupid stupid choices. I want to take care of my younger sister once she turns 18 and I'm worried I won't be able to do that - and even if I can, what fresh hell will she have to deal with in her twenties and thirties?

I have a dim awareness that my mental illness is exaggerating my thoughts, but I don't see anything that contradicts it either. I'm scared. I have this feeling in my head like I want to scream and thrash and make it all go away. I find myself hoping that someone will pick a fight with me so I can get everything out through violence for once, even though I'm nonconfrontational to a fault.

Seeking long term couples advise.. stay or go,"Please bear with me because this will be a little long, there's some history that may or may not be relevant.... also my parents, while still married, have a wildly unhealthy relationship; they are not really a relationship ideal for me to look up to. And since I don't really have a lot of married couples in my life, that I know have a happy relationship,  I'm turning to you lovely redditors, hoping that there are people out there (hopefully with experience in happy long-term relationships) that can give me some advice...

My (34f) boyfriend (32m) of 9 years and I have been going through what I would have called a rough patch... I say would have because more and more I'm feeling that this is my head and my heart telling me that there's nothing left to salvage and I'm too young to be trapped like this. 

But, I love this man to death, he's a GOOD man who loves me with all his heart and wants a future and family with me. We both want kids, and mostly agree on how we'd raise them. I know he'd be an amazing father and would always do his best to be an amazing husband.  We have so much shared history together, friends, trips, pets, homes etc. 

BUT.. Our intimacy is gone and we have almost a dead bedroom and we both have horrible communication with each other. This has been an ongoing problem for years. I love good sex and NEED good sex. I know were capable, but just are stuck in a boring ass routine..

Last year i ended the relationship, moved back to my house, and tried to move on. We went NC for a month, then followed him trying to win me back for 4 months and  eventually he ""won"" after showing me all the changes he made (gave up drinking, actually did things he said he'd do for over a year, started taking care of his appearance...) But he also repeatedly stomped on my boundaries (ie.. if we meet up you are NOT ALLOWED to try to win me back, meet up, he does it anyways, I feel guilty I'm hurting him, I feel sad, cue depression) and this made me more aware of this dynamic and his making me guilty for stating my needs then getting upset when he igroes what I said and does whatever he wants anyways 

But I relented and we got back together on valentines day (I know, stupid, but I thought romantic at the time)...

February and March were everything I dreamed our relationship could be. Our communication was better, sex life was better, I felt like we were partners building our future together. Then I snooped.... I dont know why because he was honest with me about having casually seen other people (guess he wasn't THAT heartbroken and I'm not the ONLY woman he sees) and I also was seeing other people. But I snooped because I'm a self destructive asshole who doesnt even fully trust herself.

I found out that he was still talking to his casual sex buddy he was meeting when we were broken up. She was his ""friend"" despite the fact I'd never heard her name so much as mentioned before. But when we were getting back together, one MAJOR (and he knew this was major I stressed the point a lot) point was that I wanted him to end his other casual things and take 1 week. Just 1 week to really think about us getting back together, what that would mean, and the changes that we would both need to try to do to make relationship work. Before we got back together he told me that he had broken up with her over the phone and that she was absolutely heartbroken but they were still chatting away as though nothing had happened

Suspicious now, I started scrolling through their chat history and I started to see the things that my boyfriend says, I thought he only said to me, were just lines he uses on women. I confronted him about it and we fought badly and he said that I broke his trust by going through his phone which I absolutely did but I told him that he also broke my trust by keeping this other girl around on a string in case we broke up or didn't get back together and he was very defensive because of our history and felt that he was not in the wrong even though had I known that he was still talking to her I never would have gotten back together with him to begin with and we would never have had our beautiful February and March that gave me so much hope for a future

I try and put these thoughts aside and by May I'm not really thinking about this other girl anymore but our honeymoon was over and we were falling right back into the same patterns that we were falling into last year and our bedroom started to become dead again...

We're still making plans like me moving in in the summer and we're still talking about having kids but I feel like I'm doing these things because I've committed to doing them not because I want them anymore...

In July he finds out that his sister might have cancer and there is no one but him to take care of her three daughters.. he will raise them if necessary but this news made me want to flee. Because if he gets those girls I will never be able to leave leaving a relationship that's one thing but leaving three kids who have lost their mother I could never do that even if I was unhappy myself I would have to stay until they were grown.. it's at this point that I start thinking that I need to leave him but I've already committed to leasing my house I've already committed to contributing towards his most of my stuff is already at his house so I proceeded with moving in

By the end of July I've moved back into his house, and this time I actually gave up my house to rent, so I have nowhere to go if this doesn't work out.

A few weeks ago we went on our anniversary trip, and the weekend was wretched... he was trying to build intimacy and i was pulling away. On the drive home on Monday I told him that I just wanted it to be done I was sick and tired of fighting all the time to improve the relationship just to have things go back to the way they were again. I told him that I love him but I don't think I'm in love with him and that for the entirety of our 7 years there has always been some issue with us and things have never actually just Bean good except for the two months after we got back together until I found out he lied to me. He asked me to take time to think about if this is what I really wanted, and I agreed to stay, to pretend everything is fine. Talks about our relationship are off the table until Friday at which point we will actually talk. 

This is my first long-term relationship so I don't know if it's normal to completely lose desire and intimacy with your partner because once you've known someone for so long you know them... their strengths and their weaknesses. I don't think it is normal to think about... yearn really, what life would be like single or if I was starting over... now I'm pondering whether or not one NEEDS desire to have a healthy relationship. I've seen people in arranged marriages fall madly in love with each other, so if I stay, those feelings could come back, right..? How is it possible that I loved someone so desperately and now I feel only companionship and guilt?

"AMAB, Trans-curious: Am I considering this for the right reasons?","Hi! I'm 28, AMAB, high functioning autistic, and considering Therapy and or HRT in the next few years, once I finally become fully independent and have a safe place to live.

The thing is I'm not sure? I'll start at the beginning, but try to keep it brief. Basically, before I was born, my parents thought I would be a girl, bought a bunch of girl stuff, rolled the gatcha and got me. We kept the things, and even though they were obviously girly, I didn't mind? I just knew they were mine growing up. But it planted the thought of, ""what if I was different"".

Fast forward to my late teens and I'm getting waves of this feeling at night sometimes, like I want some magical button to go back and forth. But obviously magic isn't real, so I can't, just keep surpressing the feelings.

And then I stumbled on the internet, good lord, I found El Goonish Shive, Fenoxo, and the TFGames wiki, and others, and I realized I was Bi, even genderfluid, but I didn't consider myself trans even though I wanted it, because unrealistic expectations, but I picked up a transformation fetish instead. 

So now, 5 days ago, I'm sick, my psyche is kicking the backseat, I'm getting waves of not entirely dysphoria, but like, a longing to be different again? I finally burst the bubble and started telling my family and friends what I want, and they've mostly been incredibly supportive, even helping feminize me a little bit while at home. 

The problem though is that I've never actually thought of myself as a woman, I'm not trapped in the wrong body, I have a high libido but no dating or sex because demirom, never had problems living like a chad I guess you could say. 
I'm just worried that I have some kind of fetish, or something, should I do it just because I want it? What if I don't want to socially transition? Is there a way to become androgynous and stay that way while also being trans? 

I've been voraciously consuming research, anecdotes, stories, warnings, these last couple days, but I'm afraid of making the wrong decision for the wrong reasons. 
And the repercussions on my support network if I suddenly stop and do a 180? AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH.

"(posted in r/advice also) I(f) fucked up. My bf (m) fucked up too. I need advice on what to do. His parents found out he sneaked me in, found a ""used"" condom (was not used, opened and messed with) and now I fear the worst. (4 years together)","Tl;dr - Bf snuck me out and we hung out at his house for a little, parents found ""used condom"" and evidence, they say they dont trust him anymore, nor do they like me anymore... theyre going to force him to go to homecoming with another girl, how can i support him? make myself feel better, and possibly try to apologize to his parents for my wrong too?

So, hello. Im sure youre going to judge me for sneaking out, it was stupid, my lesson is learned, and my boyfriend has learned his too.

Lets start with some background. My bf and I have been together for 4 years, (i am 17 he is 16, we're 8 months apart) and some of you might call that silly. Which i dont blame you for thinking, if my 13 year old started dating so young, id call em out too. But it happened oddly.

My home life isnt the best (BF's parents know this) I am not allowed to do anything without permission, that includes leaving, going outside, eating, and anything else above the sun. Whatever not the point. Im pretty much trapped in a tower.

Since covid, ive been homeschooling since March 13 2020, for clear reasons, we are all vaccinated, except for my little sibling, you cant be yet. So thats why now im still at home. My bf on the other hand, (his family also vaxxed) is going to in-person school. So we've barely seen eachother since March, it's been tough, he's my best friend. So of course like stupid teenagers, we planned to sneak out and meet up to hang out and cuddle (things got a bit nfsw, but no condom was used, no piv action).

I was excited, it had been forever. so we planned it, things went well, (we snuck out August 5th) until today things have been quiet, Until this morning when i get a text from my bf. he told me that his dad told him they needed to talk when he got home. Of course we freaked, because we had a feeling it was they found out we snuck out... and worse.

So we went through the day knowing. then finally he gets home, his dad gets home and they talked.

He told me, ""my dad said my mom's probably not gonna like you anymore. my dad said he has no more trust in me. my mom is gonna fucking hate me and probably you. he said I've broken both their trust, he said I fucked up and I know I did,he said he understands because he know your locked in a tower""

My bf is probably going to get alot of things taken away, which again is not a big punishment for what we did. My bf owned up and told the truth. told them why we did it etc..

Now that, most of the important stuff is out of the way I need to know.

How can i apologize to his parents for my wrong doings?

Is there any chance of getting them to still like me?

And how can i cope with the fact MY bfs mom is forcing him to go to the dance with another girl?

I feel like a horrible girlfriend i just dont know what to do anymore. how can i comfort my bf assuming him and i can still talk a little? how can i comfort him and let him know im still around even if he cant text me?

I need help.

"26 [M4F] #NYC - Tie me, tease me, then deny me like you're OnlyFans' new management team and payment processors","*Well, this title aged beautifully since I wrote it last weekend.*  
  
Hi there Reddit! It's the middle of the week, Tropical Storm Henri punched one of my skylights in, the delta variant is ripping it, and that only means one thing. I'm stuck at home with too much time to not write a personal to amuse, enlighten, and connect with my love of all things bondage and domination.

**Why are you here?**  
  
Stock markets don't trade on the weekends so I can't just go there and get fucked as I normally do. Thus, here we are.  
  
**That's great and all, but who are you?**  
  
Great question! Firstly, I'm a sub-leaning switch. I can take on both roles - it really depends on that kind of energy I share with my partner. I'm happy to talk more about it. But in either role, I am a huge bondage freak more than anything else. This means that I love getting tied up, down, left, right - or doing the same to somebody else - using ropes, cuffs, chains, and anything that happens to be handy. It is hot looking into a tied up captive's pleading Bambi eyes while I shove her own panties into her mouth and tape it shut. On the flip side, I can almost wet myself thinking about struggling against a pair of cuffs, looking into my captor's eyes as she puts a sock in my mouth and it being the last thing I see right before the leather hood goes on. The trust and intimacy it takes to do this with somebody is a palpable feeling you can almost taste. Helplessness turns me on; vulnerability greases my gears. And if you and I put on a fight, even better.  
  
As you can tell from the title, I also love playing with orgasms. Why? Because it's so deliciously wrong yet sexy at the same time. This obviously includes fucking you or getting fucked with a strap-on while either (or both!) of us are bound and gagged. This also includes tying you to a chair sitting on a butt plug with a Hitachi pressed against your pussy, bringing you over the edge over, and over, and over again. This also includes tease and denial, including chastity play, although I must warn you that I may have some problems getting into a dominant headspace after being relentlessly teased, denied, and locked away. This may or may not be a bad thing.  
  
I am also big into abduction and kidnapping play - and love playing with feelings of fear and humiliation in general. Thanks to a fantastically creative and fun group of friends, I've definitely spent more than my fair share of time tied up in the trunk of a car. They also once set me up to be arrested by fake ICE agents at TES Fest. That is a whole story in and of itself. The gang is amazing and I hope to introduce you to them one day.  
  
There are too many other interests to list fully, including various flavors of impact play. Inquire within if curious.  
  
**You said bondage...so, shibari?**  
  
Actually funny thing is that even though I am from Southeast Asia, my bondage style has tended more towards the western than the eastern. Dominic Wolfe, JJ Plush, Eric Cain, Ted Michaels, PD of Insex fame, Steve Villa - if any of those names mean anything to you, you have a pretty good idea of how I prefer to play as both a dom and a sub. But never say never. Since I now rent an apartment with a suspension rig, I'm definitely keen to explore that route.  
  
**Wait, what?**  
  
Yes, I live in a rope dojo. How I ended up here is an almost comical series of coincidences, impeccable timing, and a soft Manhattan rental market. My friend built a 800 sq ft rig from 2-by-4s and I took it over when he had to vacate for the Best Coast to start a career in Silicon Valley.  
  
**So what are you looking for exactly?**  
  
I‚Äôm looking for a girlfriend and long-term partner. I may be kinky but that's not all that I am. I want somebody to build a life together with and share in the ups and downs of this human endeavor. Something long-term, with an eye on marriage and potentially children a few years down the line, before the planet is rendered totally uninhabitable and we are both drafted for the Great Water Wars. Of course, this also means that I'm looking for something in-person and somebody who is local to the New York metro area.  
  
I'm seeking somebody who will take risks with me. Somebody to travel together with, be it sitting on a train zipping through the Cascades, pitching a tent while wild ponies raid our cooler on Assateague Island, or bound and gagged together in a friend's trunk trying to nibble at each other's ropes after being kidnapped to Dark Odyssey. I did say I was kinky, right?  
  
Otherwise, and until that happens, I am also looking for more casual play partners to break the new rope space in with either sexual or non-sexual bondage play. More friends are always better than less.  
  
**What do you do for a living?**  
  
It's a bit technical.  
  
**How about you explain it in a way that makes it sound shady?**  
  
We are the world's puppetmasters. Work for a large corporation? Without us, your boss will not be able to pay you on time. Own investments? We determine if your portfolio bounces off the surface of the moon or it takes a dirtnap. If we all disappear, all the ATMs will stop working by the end of the week. We determine what the US federal government pays to borrow money. All consumer credit runs through the fingers of me and my colleagues. Do you have a credit card? We control the rate. An adjustable-rate mortgage? My team determines if you pay 2% or 20% interest this month. A student loan? Yep, that's us. Auto loan? Hi, good to meet you, don't think we've ever had the pleasure.  
  
**So the Illuminati?**  
  
Not really. I would rather not be part of any club that admits Kanye West.  
  
**What do you actually do?**  
  
I'm a repo trader at a bank. My dad still thinks I make people's cars disappear when they're late on the payments but it's not that kind of repo. Our transactions set the benchmark interest rate for the world, so that's kind of cool. As far as traders go, I like to think of myself as not that crazy. I don't do drugs or smoke, always put on my seat belt, and pay extra for the good health insurance. Really, most professions are not as crazy as Leonardo DiCaprio makes them out to be. To manage risk, I only trade with the safest kind of money: other people's.  
  
**So what are your opinions on the Gamestop fiasco?**  
  
Twenty years from now, it'll be an amusing blip in the canon of financial history. Otherwise, don't buy it, don't hold it, don't short it, don't invite it home for dinner with the parents. This is financial advice. The level of Reddit mania around these tickers are kind of scary and cultish to be honest. It's a small-cap equity security, not Jesus.  
  
**Any tips?**  
  
I believe 20% is usually customary.  
  
**I mean do you have any favourite positions?**  
  
Probably the hogtie.  
  
**...**  
  
Don't look at me like that. I'm not the one fishing for material nonpublic information to unlawfully insider trade.  
  
**What else do you do?**  
  
Obviously, I can get very geeky about finance and, if you're keen, would happily talk about how SPACs are WACC all day until you stuff a gag in my mouth but I'm no one-trick pony. Used to do some judo in university, which has come in real handy in the kind of resistance and takedown play that turns me on. I'm keen to get that ball rolling down the tatami mat again.  
  
I'm also a photographer and was previously, at various points in my life, an army corporal, a produced playwright, a digital artist, a corporate communications officer, a software engineer, a journalist, and a copywriter. It's been quite the ride this past 26 years.  
  
**Anything else?**  
  
That's it for now, really. I guess if you're on the northeast, batten down the hatches and raid your nearest Trader Joe's because it's going to be a wet weekend.",femdompersonals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/femdompersonals/comments/pbj4zs/26_m4f_nyc_tie_me_tease_me_then_deny_me_like/,M4F,merinthophiliac,pbj4zs,/r/femdompersonals/comments/pbj4zs/26_m4f_nyc_tie_me_tease_me_then_deny_me_like/,https://www.reddit.com/r/femdompersonals/comments/pbj4zs/26_m4f_nyc_tie_me_tease_me_then_deny_me_like/,6,2021-08-25

Sun Rising Over the Pacific - Chapter 142,"#Chapter 142 - peace, at last

*1st September 1943*

After long four years of fighting the war that affected the entire world finally came to an end. Guns that were blazing in Europe, Asia, Atlantic and the Pacific finally went silent. It's over. In Europe the situation is all clear as all treaties were signed by the victorious and lost sides barely three days ago, while the end Pacific conflict will marked today with the peace treaty being officially signed

There were some discussions regarding where the treaty should be signed, though finally it was decided that the peace treaty should be signed at Midway. The idea came from the Sakura side, as they want to show the Eagle Union that despite them being on the side that ""lost"" they are seen by the Empire as someone equal. Shortly speaking, it's a sign of Sakura's good will

""Ha, almost there! I can't belive it's really over"" Musashi says with a smile and her arms crossed, watching the rather calm sea as she stands on the command bridge of Yamato's ship

""We surely earned it... But yes, it's a relief that this war's out of the picture"" Yamato replies and smiles, seeing Midway in the distance already

The Sakura representation includes Yamato, Musashi and Shinano, all three on board of Yamato's ship escorted by two Akizuki class destroyers. The Eagle side in the meantime is represented by Iowa and Enterprise, though they had to take a ride on New Jersey's ship assisted by two Fletchers. Ships of both sides have their masts packed with colorful signal flags as this is indeed a special occasion

""And here we are..."" Shinano smiles softly, her still being a bit of a sleepyhead, but not that much

""And here they are!"" Musashi says pointing at the Eagle ships which are close to the island as well

""Right on schedule. Perfect"" Yamato says calmly as soon the ships get to the small pier set up especially for this meeting. Then the girls get off board so they can exchange greetings

""Yamato! Good to see you. Ready?"" Iowa smiles 

""Haha, of course. I've been practicing my signature the entire cruise"" Yamato winks in return 

""Good one!"" New Jersey laughs softly as the whole group walks up to a table awaiting at the end of the pier. There are two documents on it, one for each side to sign

""So this is it... The deffinite end of this conflict"" Enterprise says as she picks up a pen

""Indeed. And I'm proud to be a part of this"" Yamato replies with a relief in her voice as she signs the document

""I couldn't agree more"" Enterprise nods and leaves her signature as well, moving aside letting Iowa do the same

""And... Done!"" Iowa says and puts the pen back on the table
""Ha... Such little signature, and such great meaning""

""You know what they say, sometimes pen is stronger than a sword!"" Musashi adds to the conversation

""That's also true!"" New Jersey agrees

""So... What happens now?"" Iowa asks and crosses her arms

""Now... We can all finally get some rest"" Shinano says softly

""Well, that for sure. But also rebuild after the war, and get ready for the future. And with Ironblood being so strong it surely will be interesting..."" Yamato sighs

""Plus, we have some changes going on at home!"" Musashi giggles

""Changes?"" Enterprise asks curiously

""Sister, you weren't supposed to-"" Yamato tries to oppose

""Oh come on Yammy, at least we won't be seen as an ""evil dictatorship"" anymore!"" Musashi replies and looks at the confused Eagle girls
""Shortly speaking there are some changes happening in the Empire's leadership structures. Some more or less...democratic ones"" 

""Now that's interesting news! In that case, good luck for you!"" Iowa says

""Heh... Much appreciated. I hope we'll get to meet again soon, on more friendly terms"" Yamato replies as both groups head back to their ships

All in all the Sakura-Eagle peace treaty can be called a balanced one when taking into account the military situation at the end of the war. In the end the territorial changes were limited to three small islands in the Pacific - Guam, Wake and Midway. Small but important, these three islands belong to the Sakura Empire now. There is one more place which was mentioned in the treaty, however situation there is a bit more complicated. The location in question are the Philippines which before the war were pretty much an Eagle colony. Now however, with the Eagles gone and earlier Sakura effords to promote collaboration among the local people the independence tendecies are really high. That's why Sakura Empire and Eagle Union agreed to leave the Philippines for now and see how the situation there develops

However Guam, Wake and Midway aren't the only territories obtained by the Sakura. They claimed way more lands from the Royal Navy and other nations as pretty much all islands in the Southern Asia and Pacific before Australia are now under Sakura control. Of course they won't occupy all these lands as they really want to keep the people there at bay while having access to all the resources there. That's why semi-independent states will be established, partially dependant on the Empire but free enough to ensure that no rebellions will take place

Still, territorial changes in Asia and Pacific are rather limited compared to Europe, where borders were completely rearranged. Now the Ironblood ranges from the Iberian Empire's border from the west to the Ural mountains from the east, fulfillimg the ""Lebensraum"" idea. To the north the Ironblood holds the entre Narvik Federation, therefore ""surrounding"" the neutral Scandinavian Union. The southern border lies at the Alps, with the Sardegna Empire on the other side of the mountain chain. If it comes to Iris territory, Ironblood holds all of it except around half of Vichia Dominion territories which now belong to Sardegna with the city of Lyon being pretty much a border city

Though the fate of the Royal Navy is the most interesting one, as originally the Ironblood hoped the Royals would stay away from the war. Now however they decided the split the Royal Isles, them taking ""only"" the lands located south from Birmingham, turning them into a puppet state called the Royal Protectorate, leaving the rest for the Royal Navy

Sardegna earned quite a bit as well as they recived pretty much all Balkan Kingdom's territories as Ironblood showed now interest in them, along with pretty much all colonies in Africa, just as they wanted. They kept their promises to Iris Orthodoxy and Royal Navy too, giving the first ones lands from the Sardegna borner to Lyon and to the other ones by leaving them Malta they fought for so bravely

But even with peace signed all around the world, the global situation is still far from calm. Ironblood-controlled Europe is facing problems with partisants from the occupied nations along with the already visible Ironblood-Sardegna tensions. In Asia things aren't better either, if not worse. After all, the Sakura Empire and the Dragon Empery are still at war, while the colonies in India and Australia are on verge of collapse after the fall of the Royal Navy as now pro-Sakura and independence movements have little to no opposition, except for each other of course

All in all, even with the World War being over, the world is still going to face numerous local wars and conflicts, along with tensions rising between the major powers. But for now everyone can sit down and rest after the exhausting war and watch the dawn of a new day.

Life is not as hard as parents make it out to be.,"just to state, I am aware that my life has probably been some what privileged compared to some. In no way was a raised rich or stress free and i have faced my fair share of hardships over the years but i am aware some peoples (Not most) lives may well be harder than others.

I grew up being told that juggling the burdens of life is hard and takes its toll on you, but since venturing into my own flat / apartment, working full time, making sure to keep a healthy relationship with my GF, it has been nothing but easy. i am aware that doesn't mean perfect don't get me wrong but why do the older generation act as if it is so hard and stressful to live a good life. they preach that working 12 hours a day and countless sleepless nights is what got them there, but why? i just don't get it. 

Even me, who has not been that great with money in the past, is breezing through paying bills and rent (which is in a particularly expensive part of the world). 

it just made me think of all the years i spent being anxious about moving out and away from home i could have just done it and made a head start on life. so, i guess this can also be advice for people looking to make the first move, don't be scared it is way easier and simpler than it is made out to be!",unpopularopinion,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pbcpiz/life_is_not_as_hard_as_parents_make_it_out_to_be/,,chezeryg,pbcpiz,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pbcpiz/life_is_not_as_hard_as_parents_make_it_out_to_be/,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pbcpiz/life_is_not_as_hard_as_parents_make_it_out_to_be/,22,2021-08-25
No Way Home correlation with Doctor Strange," I found something watching Doctor Strange. In the Spider-man trailer: after Strange casts the spell, we see three light beams, that could possibly be the multiverse time-line being broken. Well, those three lights are the same as those in Doctor Strange movie when The Ancient One opens his eye. I made a video in which you can see those 2 scenes synced and 2 out of 3 beams are exactly the same.

Alexa cant discover IoT devices in another VLAN,"Hi,

I have switched me hole network setup  from AVM Fritzbox to Unifi devices.

I'm using 

 \* USG

 \* USW Lite 8 PoE

 \* U6-Lite

My USG is my router and it connects directly to my provider.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm configured following networks (and SSIDS):

 \* MAIN LAN (default LAN) (SSID home-wifi) VLAN 1? (i think this is the way unifi defines its default LAN?)

Im using this network (at this point) for all my Unifi devices, laptops, mobile phones, and cabled devices (pc, printer..).

 \* IoT (SSID IoT) VLAN 99

This is the place for IoT devices with need of internet access like alexa echo devices, amazon tc stick...

 \* NoT (SSID NoT) VLAN 98

This ist the place for all my IoT devices without a real need of internet access like my sonoff tasmota flashed devices, my zigbee bridge...

&amp;#x200B;

All networks are working with the option ""IGMP Snooping"".

All my wireless networks are working with the option ""Multicast Enhancement"" and are NOT using the option ""Multicast and Broadcast Filtering"".

My NoT wireless network are using the option ""Legacy Support"" and ""2G/5G Data Rate Control"" is set to ""Lowest Density"".

At this point I have NO manually defined FW-Rules.

At this point the Service ""MDNS"" is enabled.

&amp;#x200B;

All my IoT/NoT devices are connected to the corresponding network (as I can see the devices correct in the unifi-controller in the ""clients"" tab).

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that my Alexa devices (connected via wifi to ""IoT"") cant find my sonoff tasmota (or other) devices in my NoT network (all connected via wifi).

I also connected a single sonoff tasmota device to the (wrong) wifi network ""IoT"" to test the basic function of finding a device in the same network. This sonoff tasmota device is responding after starting the discovery on my alexa devices.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I miss something to enable the discovery ""inter vlan""? I thought the service ""mdns"" will do the trick to communicate such things ""inter vlan"".

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions?

Creepy Van Driver Encounter,"This took place some years ago. 
Back then I (12 y/o, female) was visiting a friend of mine, and at maybe 7pm it was time for me to get going. My parents weren‚Äôt home, so I had to stay with my grandma who fortunately didn‚Äôt live far away from my friend (10-15 minutes walk). 
She earlier had offered to come pick me up with her car, however she really wasn‚Äôt the best driver anymore and since I didn‚Äôt want to unnecessarily stress her out I decided to just walk, after all it was Oktober, meaning it still was pretty light outside.

I had been going for some minutes, the atmosphere was relatively peaceful and not a single person was outside, or so I thought. While passing by cars and houses I also came across some white old van. It legitimately could have been the stereotypical ‚Äòfree candy‚Äô van, like the ones you see in movies. 
At first, I didn‚Äôt think much of it, I just kept walking when my eyes began to wander to the van‚Äôs windshield: Inside sat a man, maybe 40, and he looked right at me, just that it was not the coincidental eye cross, no, this man was starting at me, and smiling crazily, like some psychopath. It was pure nightmare fuel. My whole body suddenly started tingling, and my gut was signaling me to not leave this guy out of sight.

To make matters worse, the guy suddenly started waving at me, not breaking eye contact or stop grinning. For a second I thought ‚Äòmaybe I know the guy, that must be the case, right?‚Äô but it didn‚Äôt take me long to get reassured that I had never ever seen that driver and that this was just my brain making excuses. 
At this moment, I was feeling really nauseous, I started walking faster, and being about to have finally passed the van I briefly looked back. What I saw alarmed every single muscle in my body: The door was opening, the guy was getting outside, still staring and grinning at me. That was it, I ran! 
In the corner of my eye I could see him rushing back into the car and stating the motor. A picture of the guy chasing me popped up on my mind, so I turned into all kind of alleys of which I knew no car, let alone a van, could possibly fit through.

In the end, I lost him, yet I was still shaking from all the adrenaline that had just rushed through my body. Additionally, I had no idea where I was and it took me more than 30 minutes in the end to actually arrive at my grandmothers house (I was super jumpy on the whole way back). 

I am somewhat torn regarding this experience: At the one hand I sometimes feel like I overreacted, that my actions were unjustified or that I interpreted things the wrong way, but on the other hand, I exactly can remember this feeling of fear, every part of my body telling me to just get the hell away from there. 
And who knows, maybe my gut feeling actually did save me there.",creepyencounters,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/pbj9gd/creepy_van_driver_encounter/,,BigDetective_100,pbj9gd,/r/creepyencounters/comments/pbj9gd/creepy_van_driver_encounter/,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/pbj9gd/creepy_van_driver_encounter/,4,2021-08-25
6 year old and love,"My 6 year old daughter came home today and told me about a boy she liked and how he likes her back, then she went on to say how she loves him. I realized, I have no idea how to talk to her about it or where to even begin. I know with kids crushes end just as quickly as they start, I don't want to leave it alone fore too long and let her get the wrong ideas about love and what it is but I don't want to make it too complicated for her. I did ask her why she thinks she loves him and she responded with ""because he does nice things to me (or for me)"" and my only response was that it takes more than just that.

A Homebrew/Unofficial Insect race for AOS: The Chitinian Empire,"Hey everyone! I began working on this faction back last year during the summer but stopped due to other projects + not having Miniatures to represent my idea. Now that that has all mostly changed I'm back at it! 

Originally meant to be Destruction oriented, they certainly have some strong order tendecies and those who have seen this privately have said they both Order or Destruction or somewhere in the middle. So I'd live your thoughts on this, even though GA arent much of a thing anymore I'm still curious where they'd line up in your opinion. 

This is the near final draft of the overview, however I still need to go through and edit stuff, and eventually add more details/depth to the Hosts (Clan/Great Nation equiv) but my creativity has hit a mental block. New ideas that fit also as I think of them as zi still have some loose ideas i may throw in. 

Check out the link to the original blig post on Lustria Online if you are curious how it all began!

Any C&amp;C is welcome, please be polite even if this isn't your flavor, thank you! And thank you for your help/insights in advance!

The¬†Chitinian Empire


An unofficial race¬†for Age of Sigmar by Sinarai Paints/Sudsinabucket.¬†Started 2020


The Chitinian Empire is...An Insectoid race that has colonies largely below¬†ground, their numbers are innumerable. Gone nearly undectected for millennia, the Chitinian Empire has emerged again due the events of the Broken Realms, primarily the influx of Life magic and the release of Kragnos. As the Mortal Realms are reshaped and fought over on the ground and in the skies above,¬†below the blood stained soil the Chitinian Empire sees nothing but opportunities. New colonies grow across Ghyran, Ghur and Hysh, and with them the purification of what was once soured by¬†chaos, pestilence and industry.


Innumerous and unrelenting, the Chitinian Empire is nature‚Äôs destructive force made manifest. To face them in battle is to fight against thick chitin armor, obsidian sharp mandibles and acids that burn through even celestial armors. An¬†intelligent ancient race of insectoids they originate from The-World-That-Was, living largely below the surface of the natural moon Mannslieb, and what once was the Southlands and further east beyond Cathay. Their once vast Empire began to decline with the rise of Pestilence and Chaos, infected egg chambers had begun to take a toll on those colonies down below on the earth. Upon seeing the False Moon Morrslieb fall towards the world below, the High Queen Kaj‚ÄôDreza fearing the natural moon to be next ordered the moon to be moved out of orbit and reach from magics below. Winged Chitinians of all sizes piled on the far side of the moon, and with what is known as the ‚ÄúGreat Fluttering‚Äù hundreds of millions of wings began to push the moon away from The-World-That-Was. Their exoskeletons capable of protecting them from the immense cold and vacuum of space, when the task was done all the High Queen and the remaining Chitinians could do but watch the world be consumed by fire of all different colors, and eventually its destruction. Eventually bringing the moon back the Kaj‚ÄôDreza sent swarms out to check the remaining debris of the shattered world, and though few colonies somehow survived on the shards of the world, most of the insect species had been lost. For thousands of years the Chitinian Empire traveled upon their moon home pulled by giant space worms, following the still occupied shards of a shattered world they watched what would one day become The Mortal Realms. Seeing the Mortal Realms form, the Chitian Empire would first come to what is now called Ghyran and Hysh, setting up the first terrestrial colonies and the beginnings of a new empire.

Varying in shapes and sizes, they are led by the eldest and only surviving High Queen and her Queens. The only true care of the Queens are that and the colonies under her influence and their survival, anything that may put them at risk is dealt with swiftly. The Chitinians have little tolerance for Industry, and none for that of Chaos, Pestilence and Undeath. All of these seep through and into the soil, tainting it, endangering the colonies and it‚Äôs vulnerable eggs. Ever hungry and ever working to purify the world to a natural state around them, the Chitinian Empire is no stranger to war. Sensitive to the earth around them, if a city's industry goes unregulated for too long or corruption unchecked, war-swarms will be sent without warning to begin the process of purification. These swarms have been the¬†cause of whole fortified cities falling into giant sinkholes, though usually blamed as Skaven attacks until recently. With their sensitivity to the changes in nature and their constant work to purify lands to their natural state, the Chitinian Empire has found a sometimes uneasy alliance with the Sylvaneth. Though their interpretation of ‚ÄúNatural Order‚Äù may differ at times, both recognize the threat to Ghyran, and the realms, by both Skaven of Clan Pestilence and Nurgle specifically. Often find themselves on the same battlefield if even unknown until swarms of warrior bugs and burrow worms emerge from their swarmtunnels or as earth begins giving way as underground battles are revealed below the battlefield above ground.

The types of Chitinians vary widely but all start as an egg laid by a Queen or the High Queen. When the egg hatches a larva the size of a small dog crawls out, no different than another. In this stage they are very vulnerable, held together by only a slippery thick rubbery membrane. After some time, the larvae will cocoon themselves in a near impenetrable silk. Once cocooned they begin a transformation into a specialized new form. The forms that the larvae take are dependent on environmental conditions and food consumption, both of which are controlled by worker drones. From the cocoons these Cthinians can hatch as the most numerous Worker Drones and Warrior bugs or as the more specialized forms of large Burrow Worms and Dragon Sized flyers. Only the High Queen Kaj‚ÄôDezra has been able to lay eggs that give rise to Queens, using souls she is brought by the¬†War-Swarms. The souls that are brought to her from all colonies as tribute, and so that more Queens can be hatched to further the growth of the empire. This however does not stop lesser Queens seeking to ascend to that of High Queen, hoping to regain their fallen wings they consume stolen souls in secret.

Due to the events of The Broken Realms, in particular those events surrounding Kragnos and the invasion of Shyish, the once hidden race has begun to emerge.The Chitinian Empire after staying nearly undetected for millennia have responded from their underground colonies in Ghyran, Ghur and Hysh to the influx of Life Magic and decline of Death magic throughout the realms. Eggs and larvae once dying daily by the tens of thousands now not afflicted by death magic have allowed the colonies to swell once more. Becoming more active below and above alike, swarms have been sent forth in ground shaking numbers, their sole purpose to search¬†for new food sources and locations for the swelling old colonies. Rarely is a queen hatched for only by the High Queen herself can one be hatched, and only when a new colony location has been found. This keeps not only the number of Queens in check, but also keeps lower ranking queens in check, for civil war among colonies is rare, but not unheard of. Loyal Queens are rewarded with the new colonies, given the opportunity to show their leadership skills in wartorn environments and the promise of growing her own network of sub colonies. Though the best locations are reserved for the High Queen to start her own new colonies, she is generous to those who continue to serve her and the empire. Without hesitation newly hatched Chitinians begin their life serving the colony and Queen in whatever caste they are a part. The empire is ever moving, never sleeping, guided by their High Queen and Queen's drive to expand and secure their place within the Mortal Realms.

As the Mortal Realms are reshaped and fought over after the events of The Broken Realms on the ground and in the skies above, below the blood stained soil the Chitinian Empire sees nothing but opportunities. Consolidating their power after a war against the Hathorians and more recently with the Skaven, the Chitinian Empire is once again at a height of power not seen since just before the coming of Chaos. For it was during the Age of Chaos where the once isolated race was accidentally discovered by Skaven tunneling under Ghyran. Upon stumbling across a swarmtunnel of the High Queen‚Äôs colony, a pestilence was released upon worker drones which returned unknowingly to chambers that held eggs and larvae. A lasting war raged¬†underground, both Skaven and Chitinian dying in the millions daily within the massive swarmtunnels and gnawholes being carved out. It was not until the finding of an underground spring did the tides begin to turn in favor of the High Queen, her Queens and their warswarms. The underground spring came from the giant lake above, and the Lustrum node in the Lustrare River valley which gave the water a highly potent purifying property. Creating a gentle mist with the spring water and placing it upon those eggs and larvae afflicted, they began to heal and soon hatch while also developing quicker than before. Soon the Swarms, reinforced and growing, began to fight back the Hordes of Pestilent Skaven and recover lost colonies. The colonies of Ghyran were saved, but the High Queen learned a valuable lesson and sent forth more Queens into the realms of Ghur and Hysh. It was during this war that a loose alliance was forged between the High Queen and the Everqueen of the Sylvaneth, both fighting for the preservation of the Jade Forests of Ghyran and Nature as a whole.

Though the Colonies of the Chitian Empire are capable and willing to make allies, one must reason with a Queen or the High Queen to do so, and even then it is a loose alliance dependent on strict terms. These strict terms always consist of industry being regulated and that the newly dead, no matter the cause, are given up to feed the growing colonies. With little or no warning an alliance can be ended with a city simply disappearing into the ground if industry falls to toxic levels or the dead cease being delivered. Even if outright allies are not to be found, there¬†are some human settlements a part of the Burrowers Cult which worship the High Queen as a Godbeast and Queens as her spawn. These cults can be found protecting the entrances of the colonies and practice human sacrifice to the Queen they worship, sending those guilty of a crime or ceremonial sacrifices of noble birth down into Pits of the Apocalypse. These sacrifices are believed to help fuel the reemergence and the beginning of an apocalypse where the High Queen, her children and the faithful will purge all corruption from the land. Effectively reverting the realms to when they were first formed, the Burrowers Cult believes they will be the new rulers of the mortal races after The Renewal. Whether or not the Queens use visions and telepathy to fuel these beliefs is not known but is suspected.

The War-Swarms of the Chitinian Empire are vast in number, only being rivaled by that of Skavendom and the Realms of Chaos themselves. Led by either the High Queen, a Queen or a High Mothite, the warswarms move almost as one as commands are given via unique vibrations in the ground, pheromones through the air. If more than one War-Swarm is joined in battle the superior rank takes control of all present, communicating via telepathy and visions with their commanders. The way in which¬†the War-Swarms communicate make it nearly impossible for the enemy to know what is happening before the tide has already turned.

Most numerous of the War-Swarms are the war drones, a subspecies of the worker drone, and the Warrior Bugs. Both are heavily protected by thick chitin shells, though aside from small mandibles and small sharp fangs, the war drones rely heavily on their numbers. Warrior bugs, as the name suggests, are bred solely for the protection of the colony through war and are the heart of the warswarms. Standing roughly 10 feet tall, Warrior bugs come in a variety of subspecies, all have large powerful pointed legs that propel them forward, long sharp mandibles that are used to slice and pierce through armor. The most common kind having large pincers for mouths that can crush boulders, while the second most sprays a type of acid before charging it‚Äôs foes with its gaping maw. It is however not only the vast numbers of war drones or warrior bugs that one must contend with. As Warrior bugs swarm forward they are accompanied by large scorpion-like monstrosities that contend with the likes of¬†Stormfiends. Though tens of thousands may swarm from above ground, there is also movement just below the surface. Horrifying Burrow Worms the size of leviathans break through the ground, swallowing up whole regiments before diving back below the soil just to reappear again, some even spitting corrosive acid great distances. Not even the skies are untouched by the War-Swarms of the Chitinians. Dragonfly-like creatures the size of dragons secure aerial dominance alongside large flying warrior bugs, their numbers often blocking out Hysh‚Äôs light for periods at a time.

Mothites, humanoid like Moths, acting as stand in generals for their Queens or lieutenants for¬†them during battle create powerful powders on their wings. Able to control the type of powder that is produced, these warriors will fly over the ranks of Chitians and with each beat of their wings the powder falls down onto the ranks of battling insects. These powders bolster the War-Swarms capabilities making their natural armor harder, mandibles sharper and bigger, increasing movement speed, even healing wounds. The powder not only helps the Chitians, but also brings the smaller insects of the realms to their aid. The powder when it falls upon enemy lines produces blindness, paralysis and blood to be¬†filled with toxins. The War-Swarms are ever changing to meet new obstacles of battle to better protect the colonies, new variations of current species begin hatching as new conditions and food sources are found and secured.

The ranks of the Chitians War-Swarms consist of many different forms, it is that of the Queens that strike the most fear into their foes. Though rarely do they join in battle, these large centipede-like creatures with limited humanoid qualities are¬†capable of turning the tide of battle themselves. Truly monsters in their own right, long armored bodies that can stretch high into the sky are held up by strong mandibles toward the rear of the body. Gradually these legs begin to take the shape of armored hands in the thorax region before turning back into powerful legs that go up towards the head. Their mouths open to reveal thousands of small teeth and multiple long tongues that are used to grab and pull victims in. The High Queen is the only queen to retain her wings permanently, adding to her power and terrible look. Physically the High Queens and Queens are formidable, but it is perhaps their special ability to send limited range telepathy waves into enemy lines. Showing those afflicted¬†true nightmares of what waits for those who fall, even the most hardened veteran begins to lose resolve, for not even souls are at risk while fighting Chitinians in battle.

Always hungry and foraging for food for the colonies, the War-Swarms consume all parts of the body of fallen foes, leaving only a shell of¬†armor and clothing behind. Some specialized Burrow Worms consuming souls to produce Soul Silk. A sticky silk that is able to cling onto souls and the living alike and near unbreakable, it is used to trap noble souls such as generals or champions. Stored behind the War-Swarm in Soul Silk or within a special sac of a Burrow Worm, these souls are taken to the High Queen or a treacherous Queen. Deepkin are known to follow smaller War-Swarms to collect the soul silk and souls from the Burrow Worms.

The colonies of the Chitinian Empire are vastly underground although structures above ground are built, largely as defense or to make above ground dwellers more comfortable. Although structures above ground are limited above smaller colonies, above larger colonies of importance the above ground addition can rival Cities of Sigmar or the Temple Cities of the¬†Seraphon. The outer spaces of these above ground settlements resemble closer to what one would see in a human settlement, but the closer to the central swarmhole the more alien and colony-like it becomes. Towering carapace mounds next to market places, ventilation stacks that give off fumes from below being taken out of the tunnels and colony below. What once looked like a City of Sigmar changes into an alien world in the matter of a few steps. The tunnels that run below the surface and connect the various chambers and different colonies are large, often stretch hundreds of feet wide. When the tunnels are first dug they are pitch black, but this means little to the Chitinians that travel them, for they travel via vibrations in the ground and special pheromones that are given off by one another. As the tunnels are used more and more, the secretions of the insect host begins to bring forth bioluminescent fungi that give a faint light. This faint light is what allows for any sort of trade to happen between the Chitinian Empire¬†and the races above ground, for otherwise it is just a maze for those who do not dwell below to get lost in.

The Chitinian Empire‚Äôs colonies are broken up into three different Hosts depending on which realm they are a part of. These Hosts consist of many colonies that are controlled by different queens, these Queens answer to a Greater queen of the region. Ultimately all queens answer to¬†High Queen Kaj‚ÄôDreza in Ghyran. Each Host directed by their Queens and Mothites act closely but also independently of each other in a shared pursuit of purifying the realms to a state before industry and the corruption of Chaos. When Hosts do combine their colonies in a shared campaign, the War-Swarms that are gathered number in the millions, though this only¬†happens when the High Queen calls for it in times of desperation or extreme need.

The first and oldest of the three Hosts is that of Ghyran and the High Queen herself, they are the Emerald Swarm. The most numerous, the Emerald Swarm has an increased regeneration mechanism that aids them in battle that comes¬†from when the magics of Ghyran seep into the egg chambers. Chitinians hatched within the colonies of the Emerald Swarm are often greens with bright colored markings.

The Devouring Tide in Ghur have been transformed into hardened monstronsities of their former selves, which has served them well in the wars that have been fought since entering the realm. Their chitin armor hardened beyond a Bastiladons shell along with large spikes growing out, mandibles growing into two from one, and growing in size the War-Swarms of The¬†Devouring Tide strike fear into even the most darkened of souls. Though they are the youngest of the three Hosts, The Devouring Tide is integral to the war efforts of the other Hosts. By sending their Ghur morphed monstrosities to other swarms they help break even the toughest of defenses or most savage beasts. The Chitin armor of this Host are generally darker toned

The Host of Iridescence of Hysh are the most intelligent of their race, baring the High Queen herself who feeds on Hyshian light unlike other Chitinians. Bright to the eye, those of the Host of Iridescence are capable of harnessing the light of Hysh to blind their foes, and their Mothites even harness the solar and lunar lights into their wings to release waves of light outwards in a nova of destruction. Chitians of this Host are often different colors depending on how the light hits them and the purest white where there is no light.

The only thing keeping the Chitinian Empire from truly eradicating and consuming all the races is the understanding of the Queens that the race itself could not be sustained without the other races to feed upon, and that they are a part of the natural order they hope to restore. Industry and corruption of the land are what concern the Chitinians, not that mortals dwell above ground.",AoSLore,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/pbdvgg/a_homebrewunofficial_insect_race_for_aos_the/,Fan Content,Sinarai25,pbdvgg,/r/AoSLore/comments/pbdvgg/a_homebrewunofficial_insect_race_for_aos_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AoSLore/comments/pbdvgg/a_homebrewunofficial_insect_race_for_aos_the/,83,2021-08-25
I accidentally found out my ex was cheating in the most ridiculous way possible.,"This happened like 6 years ago but I didn't tell anyone at that time, and now I remembered it and thought I'd share.

So I was chilling at home when my friend called me to go with him to pay some kind of bill. When we got there I just sat on a bench waiting while my friend was doing his thing. After a while this guy came and sat next to me as its the only place available.

I was on my phone and so he was. He was texting someone and I kinda just glaced at his screen somehow because he was so close, and I noticed that the profile pic of the person he's texting looked like my girlfriend's so I had to take another look (guilty).

So I checked the name and yes it was my girlfriend, and the conversation was full of heart emojis... By that time my friend came back and we left.

When I got home I did some research on her Facebook profil and found the guy.

I texted my girlfriend ""Who is -the name of that person-"" and she immediately started saying thing like ""it's not what you think"" and ""let me explain"" which is how I knew something was up and as I only just asked an innocent question... She admitted later that they've been just flirting and he was trying to make her go out with him so I broke up with her over text.

I had the thought that all this was kinda planned since its too convinient, but I don't think so, because no one knew I was going to be at that place except my friend, and I know he wouldn't do anything like being a part of this.",CasualConversation,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/pbjkge/i_accidentally_found_out_my_ex_was_cheating_in/,,ambluedabadee,pbjkge,/r/CasualConversation/comments/pbjkge/i_accidentally_found_out_my_ex_was_cheating_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/pbjkge/i_accidentally_found_out_my_ex_was_cheating_in/,159,2021-08-25

"WHAT-not-to-do, WHY I got a 506, and HOW I spent $7,000","To be clear, by the time it came around, I was very pleased to see 506. My last FL was a 502 and my best was a 505 so **I was gambling** (and still am with my apps but so far one II waitlist and still hopeful but I will edit later). This post will be long but I have been eager to share my story so people can learn a lot of **what-not-to-do's** and some advice I have from my experience. 

I moved home due to COVID-19 and was no longer with my premed peers or accessing the usual amount of peer pressure and competition that can help us all thrive sometimes. I signed up for the Princeton 510 course (TPR) as studying accountability (with the help of my parents' $$) and chose to lean on that. Why did I not do more research? IDK! My parents are both physicians and I expected this process to be more straight forward honestly. **I was so wrong.** If you are looking at this page in preparation for your mcat and app, then you are already way ahead of me and you likely will end up just fine. 

I signed up for the June 30th MCAT. My **TPR Course** was three 3 hr lectures every week and with a full school schedule I was scrambling to finish them and did not even touch the books for forever. I was spending more time rearranging my ""to-do"" list than actually accomplishing their insane schedule (which I think only works if you are full time or read ahead). ALSO I hated the lectures. Tutors were super nice but the lecture style did not benefit me much. I needed practice and this put me behind on it. Also their **CARS** method sucks and brought me down significantly so I ended up sticking with my original strategy (read and answer Q's lol). [**This post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/516b9s/if_you_are_bad_at_cars_this_is_a_must_read/) and wise words from [/u/cabronazo](https://www.reddit.com/user/cabronazo) helped me calm down and change my ways for CARS.

**So I'm taking FL's**, mostly from TPR (which are notoriously harder), but things are not looking up.  

Feb (raw) 494 AAMC 1: 121/126/122/125, March 491 TPR 1: 120/123/121/127, April 493 TPR 2: 121/124/124/124

Started more reddit research, **started panicking that my app was going to be late** since all the neurotic premeds were submitting in May when AAMC first let them. On this point- we all get secondaries in July anyways for the most part, so if you can turn them around quickly, you will likely be just fine. All 18 of my secondaries were submitted by August 7th (3 days after I received them), and that seems to be an acceptable timeline but feel free to comment if you know otherwise. Don't stress too much about the timing (as long as you take your MCAT preferably before August) because doing well is more important than taking it early. 

So I got the 493 on my FL in April, **stressed out, quit TPR, and started Khan Academy (especially for physics), and Jack Westin**. It did not help me much (more lectures, less practice). I was also doing Jack Westin and trying to fill in content gaps but did not see much progress and soon quit both. 

My plan was to take a **FL every weekend** (lol, too much, especially given my content gaps). I still had not read many of the (TPR) textbooks but was hoping practice would help enough to make up for it. 

May 500 TPR FL 3: 127/126/124/127, May 501 TPR 4: 124/126/124/127, Repeated AAMC FL 1, got a 502: 124/128/123/127

Felt better but not close enough. Found a 3rd year med student tutor for $50/hr on Wyzant who recommended I quit Jack Westin (too easy esp for CARS daily), and **start UWorld and ANKI**. UWorld had the best explanations I have ever seen, especially for physics and bio (very visual, high quality 3D), and allowed me to make flashcards of the problems/explanations to review for EVERY mcat section. 

So it is June 10th and I take AAMC FL2: 496 with 122/125123/126. **Tears. Postponed the test to July 30.** Talked to my boss and got one month of almost 100% studying with only working 2 days per week. Continued content review (bc I was STILL behind from my changing study methods), and worked with my tutor through UWorld while *trying* to keep up with Anki. Also worked through all of the AAMC material (priceless), especially the SB's (gold- each twice). 

I worked on my primary app so I could get verified since my MCAT was a bit late in the cycle now. I sent it to my university's writing center and family and friends. I had finished my PS in April so that was a relief. I submitted my **primary on June 23rd** to Harvard (as a joke and also bc I knew I was applying everywhere so didn't want to send one to a school I would have any chance at). It was **verified 7/27**. 

I got a 505 in mid July and felt encouraged. Continued intense prep and took one last FL days before my test and got a 502. I felt panicked but decided I would go for the gamble after all my hard work. It was very hard to maintain any kind of positivity or optimism after this test had taken over my life and I had tried so hard to maintain a strong mentality. I have a 3.93 and great EC's and am honestly used to achieving highly and doing well in school (as we all are). I would like to say it was a ""humbling"" experience but **it truly almost wrecked me**. However, I know this is the only thing I see myself doing and the MCAT is how you freaking get there. 

July 30th came around, I took the test and felt surprisingly good about it. **I ended up with a 506**: 125, 128, 125, 128. BS and CP were low but I am hoping my other stats can help me pull through. Like I said, by the end of this journey I was proud of my score and my hard work. But I would do pretty much everything differently in the future (and I will if I retake). I will also take it sooner, prep sooner, and read the books before I even prep because those were a drag and held me back in my practice. 

Quick note, as you look through MSAR and decide where to apply, schedule your **SJT and CASPER** asap bc those delayed my app since I thought you had to know which schools to put on them first. You do NOT need to assign Casper to schools, so just sign up and take it (2 hrs of youtube prep and you'll do fine), and just take it and you can assign schools later. It takes 2-4 weeks for results so don't let this delay your secondaries after all the hard work. 

I got **secondaries** 8/4 and submitted 8/7. I applied to mostly schools where I was within the 25% of their MCAT average on MSAR. I also sent a few 10% (which I have heard is more a donation but fuck it). I was surprised how many schools have such strong in-state preference but I shot my shot at 18 schools that accept decent amounts of OOS applicants. So far I have heard back from WVU for an II Waitlist but I am hopeful and will update this if there is more news in the future.

Here is the **cost breakdown**. The many transcripts are in part because I filled out the 2021 app at first and had to resend transcripts, then because of the TMDSAS and AACOMAS app, although I sadly did not end up submitting those because I changed my mind later in the game. 

92 (transcripts), 239 (uworld), 30 (study abroad backup transcript shipping), 320 (mcat), 48 (transcripts), 48 (interfolio), 66 (transcripts bc I sent them to the 2021 app originally rip), 200 (amcas app), 28 (msar), 798 (primary apps to 18 schools), 132 (casper to 12 schools), 1068 (Wyzant tutor), 1320 (18 secondaries), 2965 (princeton¬†prep)

**= $7,354 for APPS ALONE**

Legal Advice (for Apartment Renters),"TLDR: Apartment ÁÆ°ÁêÜ‰ºöÁ§æ is seemingly trying to renege/weasel their way out of me being compensated for lost funds/wages/etc. after pipes burst and leaked into the business on the first floor, and now I am strongly considering taking legal action to get back what I am owed.„ÄÄCan anyone refer a good lawyer, or someone they've talked to before? Japanese is no issue.

----

I posted on the Weekly Complaint thread a week or so back briefly talking about my situation, but here goes:

I live in an apartment on the second floor of a three story building. The first floor has a cram school, the second floor has a salon and my apartment, and the third floor has two apartments. On August 12th, I received a call from my apartment ÁÆ°ÁêÜ‰ºöÁ§æ stating that there was a significant leak in the cram school and they needed to check my sinks and plumbing to see where the cause was. I rushed home and their plumber they had on call checked around all my sinks, tub, and toilet and couldn't find anything. He checked the salon and the other apartments as well, but the leak was still causing issue. They left saying they would need to come back with a different contractor to assess the situation and make a plan.

The next day, they come back with two plumbers from a 24 hour company. The apartment company also sent a different representative, we'll call him Oops, who came to oversee the inspection. The two plumbers went around my apartment and said they would need to open up holes in my floor and my walls to get to the pipes and that construction would start on Saturday. They would need to turn off our water until they finished their work, meaning we would need to leave. Upon the plumbers leaving, Oops talked to my girlfriend (Japanese) and I, asking if we knew any hotels in the area we could stay at, as the water was turned off and we couldn't shower or use the restroom anymore. It's the suburbs of West Tokyo, so aside from one love hotel, we would have to do some mad searching to find something more suitable. But it was at this juncture, we started asking Oops what would happen. Oops told us:

1. Renters insurance would cover hotel costs while we were out of our apartment.
2. Renters insurance would cover wages lost for needing to take off to move things out of the apartment to the hotel.
3. Renters insurance could also cover the difference in transportation from our Commuter passes and our hotel. 

We said we would find a hotel or some place to stay and send a receipt to him the next day, so we spent all night to find something reasonable. We found an airbnb halfway between gf's work and my work and I took the day off to move everything in. 
Here's where it starts to get messy. 

After I sent the receipt for the airbnb, Oops called and asked me if I could cancel the airbnb as he would find a monthly mansion for us to stay instead, somewhere in Nakano (out of the way). The place we found was 4000 yen a night for two weeks, about 80000 yen after fees were all said and done. Airbnb's cancellation policy stated we would be unable to cancel without paying in full (day of moving in) so we said we would stay in the airbnb and sent the receipt, as was the original plan. I called later that day to ask about my wages and if he had gotten the receipt and the ÁÆ°ÁêÜ‰ºöÁ§æ said Oops was away and couldn't pick up the phone.

I had to go back to the apartment on Saturday, August 14th to watch as they started to do work. The plumber from the contractor company said he would need to cut holes in my closet (which he originally said was not necessary) so I would have to move everything. He would also have to cut holes in my living room to access pipes. I was really upset that things were already getting more out of hand, that I had to essentially move so quickly, and now break down my apartment so they could fix things... I spent 3 hours moving things out of my closet and getting the place ready while he started to do his work. I asked Oops, who was there to oversee, about the receipt and about my wage and my gf's transportation fee, and he said they were looking into it and would get back to me. 

I asked about the scope of work with the plumber contractor and he said that because it was Obon week and their supplier was closed, they would have to wait until at least Tuesday before they could get the manpower and resources to take care of the pipes. Oops said that he would have to contact another company to take care of the holes in the floor, which would come after the plumbing company finished their work. It would be at least two weeks... So it was left at that. Oops said he would call me with updates at the end of the day and afterwards. And for that part he did, he called to say they opened four holes and that they would be continuing their work during the week.

Tuesday roles around, we reached out via mail again to check on the hotel fees, my wages, transportation, etc. No response from Oops. Wednesday we call in the evening because still no response. Oops was on vacation and didn't tell us and didn't pass the work off to anyone else in his team. We were left in the dark for two days.

So naturally we are upset. Not only am I still out money with no recourse in sight, but now we were essentially blown off for two days, time that could have been spent taking care of our situation and consoling us, who are still moved out of our apartment. They transfer support over to Tanaka-san, who clearly has more experience than Oops. He's dumping all of the Â∞äÊï¨Ë™û and saying they are deeply sorry for all of the confusion. Hotel fees, wages, transportation were still Á¢∫Ë™ç‰∏≠ but they found another leak in the apartment that would require another contractor separate from the one they acquired in order to replace the part causing a leak. If they could not fix the leak, they would arrange to have the new contractor reach out to us and we would not be able to use the sink that had the leak until it was fixed, meaning that we were essentially going to be on the hook and waiting even longer for this whole ordeal to finish. 

This conversation was on Friday. The weekend goes by, we reach out again on Monday to again check about hotel fees, my wages, and transportation. Also to see whether or not they found a contractor who could take care of the work while we are in a hotel (until August 27th). No response. Yesterday (Tuesday) no response. 

Finally tonight we get a response. Our ÂÆ∂Ë≤°‰øùÈô∫ said that the hotel, the wages, and the transportation were not covered. So now the ÁÆ°ÁêÜ‰ºöÁ§æ has to negotiate with the owner about covering the costs. This will still take time. They haven't gotten any update again from the contractor for the smaller leak and there's now a significant chance we will still have to deal with this after we move back in this Friday. 

This is all shady because:

1. Oops told us everything would be covered by insurance.
2. Oops and the ÁÆ°ÁêÜ‰ºöÁ§æ were so quick to remedy the issue for the cram school, but now there are four work days where there was nothing done to help take care of our issue. 

---

GF says that there is a chance the ÁÆ°ÁêÜ‰ºöÁ§æ didn't get the proper insurance, meaning there's a good reason for us to pursue legal action. She will ask around and research and I said I would reach out, to which I am doing here.

Heritage Learner Finally Reached C1 After Self Study,"Don't really have any one else to share this with who would care (about language learning) so here I am.

About a year ago I became really interested in re exploring my family's culture and history. Improving my Spanish to be able to interact with the culture in its original element seemed like the obvious first step. I've been conversationally fluent my entire life thanks to Spanish being spoken by literally every one at home. However, at the start of this process, I really lacked a lot of literary vocabulary  (I had literally never read in Spanish, ever, apart from in businesses / restaurants) and specialized domain vocabulary. I also hadn't used my Spanish (apart from conversing with relatives from time to time) in almost 10 years. 

I did the opposite of what most immersion sites suggest -- instead of focusing on consuming narrow content, I basically just blasted my ears with 3+ hours of Spanish podcasts every single day, about literally any and every thing, often being discussed by numerous speakers. If at any point during my day I could have my earphones in listening to Spanish, I did. I would sometimes pause to quickly look up word definitions if it was repeated more than once, and quickly continue listening. I was very aggressive with vocabulary via Anki to start (35 new cards a day to begin, now tapered down to 10 a day).

I primarily consume content from the country my family is from, but don't shy away from content I find captivating that is produced by native Spanish speakers from other countries. I read a lot of YA books (where I can focus on engrossing myself in the story with very, very minimal word look ups) and spend 1-2+ hours a day reading almost every day. I also text all of my friends all day long in Spanish and have hour+ long phone conversations in Spanish with family and friends a few times a week.

I still battle with the subjunctive tense and make mistakes when conversing but people always understand what I'm saying. Overall I am still working on adding vocabulary (Feel like I'm always finding new words!) and my speed when speaking. (I can speak pretty fast but there's a noticeable increase in errors in re: conjugations / tense usage etc when I try to speak too fast). I have always had strong pronunciation so I'm not concerned with my accent so much. Sorry for such a long write up, this was a damn ramble. 

I guess I just want to say: keep going, and you will improve. Make the decision to interact with the language as much as possible every single day and there is no way you will not make some sort of progress. Thanks for reading.",languagelearning,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/pb6433/heritage_learner_finally_reached_c1_after_self/,Successes,louisprimo,pb6433,/r/languagelearning/comments/pb6433/heritage_learner_finally_reached_c1_after_self/,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/pb6433/heritage_learner_finally_reached_c1_after_self/,16,2021-08-25
I (m 16 yo) got myself into a pretty bad situation. Does anyone know what I could do?,"So this is kind of a Complex story but it certainly will be entertaining.
I male and 16 years old developed a crush on a classmate. So far so good something like that happens and normally I have the habit of making sure that the other person feels the same way or at least is interested before I become more involved emotionally. This simply is a psychological mechanism to keep myself happy and won‚Äôt have to deal with the bad feeling of unrequited love.
Unfortunately the lockdown forced me to stay at home most of the time and I didn‚Äôt see my friends that much which led to a deprived self that needed human contact, which means when I got interested in the first place the dopamine rush and the connection made me not cautious enough. Still I was going to watch out. She was a shy girl, didn‚Äôt talk much, and was insecure. Still she had a big ego a funny and weird humor and values she‚Äòd defend to her death. She talked a lot to me, we joked a lot and flirted like fricking hell, like almost all the time and still today. Jokes, innuendo, and a lot of teasing. Everytime I touched her she would giggle blush and be all nervous and that was where I made a mistake. I mistook her nervousness that came of uncertainty for the happy and excited reaction of somebody interested. A few weeks later I asked her out and well she said yes she could not meet up during vaction and I knew that before but she said she would tell me when she had time smiled at me nervously and promised. The weeks  passed and she never spoke of it again. Finally I learned the truth. Through a classmate that had overheard a conversation. The girl had not wanted all of this she had lied and joked about the concept of me and her being together in not the nicest way possible. She is a nice person she tries to accept anyone as the person he or she is but this is just cruel. She still flirts a lot even sends memes that suggest lovey dovey stuff but she still said she is not into me to aufriebst of hers and it seems like it. It did more damage than a simple no could have every done and no I am questioning my lifeespecially  after she a bisexual girl had a lesbian flag bracelet at school and I as ably have not as good chances in general anymore. I know she likes girls more than boys and indirectly rejected me onces.

Always feeling like there‚Äôs more I don‚Äôt know and it‚Äôs making it hard to forgive,"For the last 6 months I have been having problems with my SO lying and doing what I consider emotional infidelity, although he does not. After the third time I am having such a hard time forgiving because I feel like there‚Äôs more I don‚Äôt know. 

In January we had an incident where I asked to use his phone because mine had no service. I don‚Äôt know how to use his type of phone so instead of going back I closed the app by mistake. Before I could ask him to help me get back to where I was, he ripped the phone out of my hand and started accusing me of going through his phone and trying to ‚Äúfind things‚Äù. We had a silent car ride home and then I told him that nobody acts that way unless they are hiding something. He swore to me it was a knee jerk reaction based on an old relationship, though he never mentioned this before. I chose not to go through the phone at that time and I chose to forgive him. The first time forgiving was very easy. 

In June we were out to dinner for my birthday. He told me to go on Instagram and look at the cute picture of me he posted on his story. I went to look but it was not there. I have an account for my dog, so I switched to that account and I could see the picture. I asked him why he had me blocked from viewing his story. He said he didn‚Äôt which was an obvious lie. I told him to show me and he proclaimed NO! And then started to list of a bunch of nice things that he wanted to for me that he never wants to do (ex. take a vacation, go to the museum, have a photo shoot, etc). Once we got home I confronted him and he said that he thought it made me upset that he was always posting about his business and never of me. Again I chose to let this go and forgive, but it was harder. 

In the beginning of July I went on a trip with my friend. My SO always comments how good I look in photos, but he wasn‚Äôt doing this anymore. I asked him about it and he said it‚Äôs not his job to comment on every single photo and he tries to as much as he can. I got a sour feeling about this because he normally wouldn‚Äôt say something like that. He has an Instagram for his business so I decided to look through the followers and there was about 25+ that were porn stars, sex workers, OnlyFans models, or cam girls. I started going through those girls photos. Not only was he liking them all, but he was commenting sexual things on them from the business account. Though it was late at night I called him crying about this. At first he tried to dismiss it as not a big deal. Then he tries to say this was a new demographic he was trying to break into for his business. That was an obvious lie. The next day he said he felt very sorry but didn‚Äôt want to talk about it until he had ‚Äúcleared his head‚Äù. After two days we were able to sit down and talk and he said that he doesn‚Äôt know why he did that and he never thought it was a big deal, but he hated how much he had hurt me. I told him I consider this emotional cheating, although he does not, and that some of those women were from our area. He offered to have me go through the phone but after 2.5 days I knew he would have had time to delete everything. 

After this time I am having such a hard time with forgiveness. I feel like a fool, or like there might be so much more I don‚Äôt know. He claims that was the last of it but after 3 lies how can I be sure? I feel a pit in my stomach constantly. I don‚Äôt know who he is communicating with or who he sees when I‚Äôm not around and it makes me feel so bad. We‚Äôre not the type of couple to post each other much, and I never thought anything of it. But now I feel like I‚Äôm a secret to be kept. We have been together for 3 years and this has seemed to come out of nowhere. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how I can learn to forgive after this.",AsOneAfterInfidelity,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/pblc1i/always_feeling_like_theres_more_i_dont_know_and/,Feeling Down,mallrat47x,pblc1i,/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/pblc1i/always_feeling_like_theres_more_i_dont_know_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/pblc1i/always_feeling_like_theres_more_i_dont_know_and/,24,2021-08-25
I'm not allowed to leave the house,"So the pandemic situation is still kinda bad here but there's no lockdown atm. I haven't really gone out since last year, less than 15 times probably. I wasn't even allowed to meet my friends in the neighborhood but I didn't mind it all that much cause I don't like leaving my house but also cause I'm not allowed to go out unless I wash my hair each time I go out which is kind of a hassle with long hair. Back in around September of last year, two of my best friends that I've known since kindergarten wanted to meet up but my mum refused so I let it be. Seeing as to how I wasn't allowed to go out, they stopped asking and they've become way closer. I finally got to hang out with them on my birthday but we'd become so distant that I felt non existent and I was more or less ignored the whole damn time and I can't help but blame the pandemic for this. Flash forward to now, I have another set of best friends that I haven't met in forever. We've been planning to meet for months now and we kinda decided on next week. Their parents agreed but it's just mine who won't. I'm afraid the same thing might happen with them and I'll eventually lose every single friend that I have, which isn't a lot anyway.

The simple reason why my mom refuses to let me go out is because I'm kinda weak, which I admit I am and I'm unvaccinated but that can't be helped cause there's no proper vaccine here for minors yet. Not just that, I'm not allowed to eat food from outside unless she sees to it that it's properly heated, which is somewhat understandable but at a restaurant I'm pretty sure they heat up food anyway. She argues that it could be on the plate or the furniture but in that case it could be literally anywhere. I understand that she's concerned but I don't think I'm making an unreasonable request here. I haven't meet them in over a year and the last time I really went out was in March, with my other friends and that turned out to be shittiest birthday I've ever had. I think she might have agreed if it was at someone's house but their homes aren't available. She won't allow me to have them over at ours either. She lets my brother to go out and he basically gets to meet his friends almost every other week because he's healthier than I am. I have a life too and I can't stay in this house forever and there's no telling when this pandemic finally ends for good. I honestly don't know what to do.

Destination wedding. No kids allowed.,"So I'm a bridesmaid in a destination wedding. I just sat down to see how expensive this would be. Ballpark 2,000 dollars. I luckily already have my passport. It's a 3 day minimum stay in Mexico. My husband would stay home with the baby. My mom offered to fly to our house to help watch her so he doesn't have to burn up PTO (LO isn't in daycare) she will be 6 months old by the time the wedding rolls around. At first I thought no big deal I'll go. Now I feel terrible but I dont think I can leave my baby and be thousands of miles away from her. Not to mention spending 2k less than a month after Xmas. I'm so torn. I feel like an asshole either way. I just need some advice.

"Sister had a baby, not sharing updates or info","My sister had a baby on Saturday, the first baby in my family. Her husband called my parents and me on Saturday morning, told us her water broke and she is at the hospital. He mentioned she would not be near her phone at all and we should call him for updates. 

On Sunday morning, he called and said she delivered a healthy baby girl on Saturday night. Didn‚Äôt give any details however, no name, weight, size, time of birth. Just that baby was healthy, my sister was healthy and both are sleeping. My husband took this call since I was out walking the dogs. 

I sent my sister a text on Sunday congratulating her and haven‚Äôt heard back. Texts left on read. Called a couple times, nothing. Sent her husband a text yesterday asking how things are going, very vague response from him. My parents also haven‚Äôt heard anything. No pictures, no updates. We don‚Äôt even know if they are home from the hospital. I asked in my text but her husband did not respond to that question.

I‚Äôm probably very selfish for saying this, but I‚Äôm rather hurt she gave birth three days ago and I still don‚Äôt know anything about the baby. I know there is a chance something went wrong, but I‚Äôm not sure why my sister would want to keep her family in the dark about that. We are a very tight-knit group. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be this way. I thought I‚Äôd at least know the name by now. I know giving birth is an exhausting experience and I‚Äôm trying hard to give the benefit of the doubt. I also know postpartum depression is a possibility. Just very confused why I haven‚Äôt heard anything from her, when before Saturday, we spoke everyday. Any insight or advice would be appreciated.

"I wrote a hypothetical pitch meeting for Spider-man: No Way Home. Technically there are no spoilers because all of this either comes from the trailer or my ass, but SPOILER WARNING just in case.","PRODUCER GUY: So, you have a third Spider-man movie for me?

SCREENWRITER GUY: Yes sir, I do. It's called *Spider-man: No Way Home*.

PG: Oh, I like how you got the word ""home"" in there, like in the other movies!

SG: Thanks, I worked really hard on it.

PG: So at the end of the last movie Spider-man was revealed to the world as Peter Parker. I bet that's going to have a pretty big impact.

SG: It will! So it starts out with Peter Parker and MJ and she's reading a tabloid newspaper about how Spider-man might have powers of seduction because, you know, spiders are known for being really seductive.

PG: Oh, seductive spiders are TIGHT!

SG: Yeah they are! And since everyone knows that Peter Parker is Spider-man he's really sad about it. He's in trouble with the law and all of his classmates look at him weird now and all of his friends are getting interrogated by the police.

PG: Oh, is he going to get Matt Murdock as his defense attorney?

SG: Who?

PG: Matt Murdock? He's also known as Daredevil, he had his own series on Netflix recently...

SG: Oh him? No, he's not in this.

PG: Oh.

SG: Yeah, so Peter sees this Halloween decoration of a witch and he's all like ""I know, I'll get my good friend Dr. Stephen Strange to cast a spell that'll fix all of this"".

PG: Dr. Strange! He's the guy from the other movies!

SG: He sure is! And since we basically wrote ourselves into a corner in the last movie the only way out of this is through a magic spell that will erase everyone's memory of Peter Parker being Spider-man.

PG: He's going to cast a spell to erase everyone's memory? Why doesn't he just call Talos the Skrull from the last movie?

SG: What do you mean?

PG: Well, Peter did Talos a pretty big favor in the last movie, and seeing as Talos is a shapeshifter couldn't he just disguise himself as Peter and walk around in full view of the public, while Peter himself could swing around as Spider-man and then there would be hundreds of witnesses who saw both of them at the same time in the same place?

SG: Listen, if we do that the movie will be only ten minutes long and we won't make any money on it so I'm gonna need you to get all the way off my back about Skrulls.

PG: Well, I do like money so I'll get off of that thing.

SG: Thanks, and so Dr. Strange's roommate Wong tells him not to cast the spell because it's dangerous and Dr. Strange is like ""Oh, I totally won't"" but then he winks at Peter.

PG: Is it because he's totally going to cast the spell?

SG: He's totally going to cast the spell.

PG: I knew it!

SG: Yeah, and so he starts casting the spell but suddenly Peter is concerned that his close friends and family are going to forget that he's Spider-man and he doesn't want that to happen so he starts talking and disrupting Dr. Strange while he's casting...

PG: He can't just tell his friends and family that he's Spider-man later?

SG: Nope! And so Dr. Strange's spell gets screwed up and that causes The Multiverse to open up and that's when things get really crazy.

PG: How crazy are we talking?

SG: I'm talking super crazy, like all of the villains from the last Spider-man movies all come out so there's, like, Dr. Octopus and Green Goblin and Electro and Lizard and Sandman and they're all played by the same actors who played them in the other movies.

PG: Wow wow wow. Wow.

SG: And so Peter has to fight them all and it's just a massive fight, I mean there's electricity shooting everywhere, and pumpkin bombs, and those mechanical arms, and sand is getting everywhere...

PG: Oh, I hate sand.

SG: Sand is the worst, like when it gets into your underwear...

PG: Oh I actually like sand in my underwear, it's the only place I really like sand being.

SG: Oh, you're a real weirdo, aren't you? But then it turns out Dr. Strange isn't really our Dr. Strange, he's another Dr. Strange from the Multiverse and so he starts fighting Peter too!

PG: There's another Dr. Strange?

SG: There's another Dr. Strange!

PG: Is it really Mephisto?

SG: No, it's the alternate universe Dr. Strange that we introduced in an episode of *What If...?* last summer.

PG: Oh, I love it when one of our properties advertises another one of our properties!

SG: I knew you would!

PG: But wait, why didn't Wong, Dr. Strange's best friend, realize that it was the wrong Dr. Strange?

SG: I don't know!

PG: Fair enough! So why does he start fighting Peter?

SG: Because he's an evil Dr. Strange!

PG: That works!

SG: And so Peter, you know, he's really taking a beating but then another portal through the Multiverse opens up and an older Peter Parker played by Tobey Maguire comes out and he's a more experienced version of Spider-man and so he's really able to help out with the fight.

PG: That's great, a lot of people grew up with the Sam Raimi Spider-man movies so I expect this will make us a lot of money from the nostalgia alone and money is great.

SG: Yeah yeah yeah!

PG: And is Andrew Garfield going to show up too? So that way we have three Spider-men?

SG: No, we're not doing that.

PG: I think people are going to be disappointed if that third Spider-man isn't there.

SG: Oh, I didn't think about that. Oops!

PG: Oopsie!

SG: So Tom Holland Spider-man and Tobey Maguire Spider-man, there really doing their best to fight all these villains but they're really getting beat and so Tobey-spider-man, who I'm just going to call Spider-Beard because he has a beard now, he says ""We gotta go, come on!"" and they jump into one of the Multiverse portals!

PG: And does Spider-beard know where they're going?

SG: Unclear, but they end up in this freaky alien bar place with lots of purple and green everywhere, and if you look real closely you can sort of make out Loki and Sylvie in the background!

PG: That's a scene from another one of our shows!

SG: It is! And so Spider-man and Spider-beard, you know, they talk.

PG: They talk?

SG: They talk. About spider-things. You know, just bonding.

PG: So they just sort of hang out? Isn't this bar the one that gets destroyed in an apocalyptic event?

SG: It is!

PG: Are there any more of those Multiverse portals laying around?

SG: There aren't!

PG: Oh, I bet it's going to be hard to get out of this situation!

SG: Actually it's gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

PG: Oh, really?

SG: Yeah, one of those sling ring portals just opens up and, you know, the actual Dr. Strange from the main universe comes in and they all go back to Earth.

PG: Man, with magic and multiverse shenanigans we can pretty much do anything we want at this point!

SG: We sure can, and it doesn't have to make any sense at all! So Spider-man and Spider-Beard and the real Dr. Strange, they all have to strategize because, you know, all of those villains from alternate dimensions are just running around and destroying stuff in New York. Green Goblin is flying around pumpkin-bombing everything and Electro, you know, he's just shooting beams of electricity into the sky for the fun of it...

PG: We do love our sky beams!

SG: And so it's just a massive battle with one fight after another, and then Ned and MJ show up and Peter saves them from getting straight-up murdered by Sandman and he tries to talk to them but they don't remember who he is!

PG: Because of the spell!

SG: Because of the spell! And so the fight goes on for about twenty minutes and one by one, you know, they beat the villains and tie them up and then Dr. Strange opens the Multiverse back up and sends them packing.

PG: And is there a post-credit scene? I feel like we need a post-credit scene, you know, keep the audience in their seats for an extra ten minutes...

SG: There is a mid-credits scene where Wanda from WandaVision shows up at Dr. Strange's place and she needs his help because her two kids are trapped in another dimension and she needs to save them. And then in the post-credits scene we see Peter staging like a sort of coming-out party for his friends and Aunt May because, you know, they need to be reminded that he's really Spider-man.

PG: You know, this sounds great and all, but I feel like we're missing out on a real opportunity by not getting Daredevil and the third Spider-man.

SG: Oh, do you think it'll hurt our box office at all?

PG: Hard to say.

"Cult-ish practices, encouraged to marry quickly, what I‚Äôve witnessed from Amway","I couldn‚Äôt cross post, I posted this in the Amway community originally.

 Encouraged to marry quickly, Amway cult-ish practices

I know a couple of late 20‚Äôs-early30‚Äôs women who recently got into into Amway and the mentor ship program Worldwide Dream Builders, and they went full force into it. Our friendship started going downhill immediately bc I called it a side gig and kept questioning and countering their spiel which one was quoting but obv not truly understood herself (vague af). It was concerning but I figured it would fizzle out naturally and we could resume our friendship once the veil was lifted. Well!!! They‚Äôre more competitive than I realized bc they‚Äôre in the cult up to their eyeballs and digging deeper. I‚Äôm not certain but I think both have been pushed into marriage. One met a guy at a conference and weeks later they were getting married and had already been in couples/marriage counseling and ready to tie the knot, so any questioning was dismissed, or just not asked by her family. 

Months later we found out they both sold their tv‚Äôs. No explanation and I mentioned to their mom who found this so endearing and proud of their dedication that it was a waste of money already spent, they didn‚Äôt have to watch tv if they didn‚Äôt want, and they could keep the flat screens in a closet as they‚Äôre not bulky anyway. The mom stayed silent. Recently we learned they watch tv with a projector, so what was the point? 

One weekend they got rid of all their alcohol, and they‚Äôre not alcoholics, but they‚Äôre very social and he previously worked as a bartender, so it was something they both enjoyed (I myself keep a full bar at home, but rarely drink). In any case, I got a lot of booze, yay me. 

Recently, the other chick (who had a meltdown when she turned 30 bc she hadn‚Äôt been able to retire yet, as promised) found a guy and will be getting married soon and of course, it will be a dry wedding. 

Throughout the whole pandemic, they‚Äôve traveled more than anyone else I know COMBINED. When one got COVID, she blamed it on a coworker, not her frequent flights to Florida or Texas or the weird shopping trip by her mentors, which I thought was laying it on thick. I mean what kind of legitimate business gives you morsels of a luxe life. Feels like when you start dating a manipulative jerk who love bombs you at first to get you hooked. 

Anyway, their whole lives are Amway, all conversations end in Amway. Stayed at my house and she woke up earlier than me at 7am and said her mentor wakes up at 5am and makes a huge breakfast spread for their guests. I‚Äôm not a morning person so it rubbed me the wrong way, but I just said ‚Äúgood for him‚Äù when I wanted to say ‚Äúthe toaster is right there.‚Äù So later we discussed kitchen layouts (they‚Äôre regularly encouraged to plan for their future mansions) and I said something about Pinterest, and she showed me on an Amway version of Pinterest. 

It‚Äôs really frustrating that they alienate their people (can‚Äôt even call them employees bc they‚Äôre not!) SO INTENSELY away from people, ideas, and even inspirational web pages. 

I guess I‚Äôve been labeled the Amway version of a suppressive person bc all my questions or comments get me a short, curt answer.  It makes me sad to see them talk about nothing but Amway and their mentors and Diamond this and Diamond that and planning for mansions and private islands and whatnot. 

They‚Äôre already cooking their books and writing every single thing off as a business expense, so the mentor ship isn‚Äôt very kosher to me. 

It‚Äôs awful just sitting back and waiting for them to burn out and return to their senses or since they‚Äôre morally questionable, actually make it in Amway and become even more abrasive and straight up crooked businesspeople.

SOD2 experience.,"I've been playing since it launched. And besides some flaws I really didnt have much bad to say about it. I actually liked it and was more forgiving for its flaws back then. And that's because I had already geared my head towards SOD2 being more of a work in progress type of game. And I loved this game even tho it wasnt completely fine tuned.

But as time went on, up until now I stayed patient with these flaws. But I started finding myself quietly coming up with excuses for the game for bad spawning, horrible hit detection and just things that just should not be acceptable in this kind of game. And I had to step out of my ""Fan Boy"" status I have with the game and realize; at what point do I realistically need to come to terms that one of my favorite games isnt what I've convinced myself it is? And once I acknowledged this, I had to know what it was that was keeping the game from being what I think it could be.

Please dont ever forget, SOD2 is one of my all time favorites. And that is the only reason I was as patient as long as I was. But SOD2 has allowed some of these flaws to go on unchecked so long that its breaking the ""video game golden rule"". That rule being parameters.That meaning nothing should happen or be allowed to happen outside the players ability to react, interact and complete/fail any given obstacle. In other words the player should always have the ability or have had the chance to gain the ability to succeed. And if you dont think that sounds right to you please let me know.

Take Hellblade for example. The almost boss fight with Hela at the end of the game. You cant succeed. You just keep fighting as more and more enemies come. And they keep getting tougher the longer you last. You fight to the death only to realize how impossible this battle is. But guess what? Right when I'm thinking this is kind of lame, right as Senua cant fight anymore I realize theres a method to the madness. There is a reason why the fight is impossible. It's a part of the ending. It's the story the game was trying to tell. And on top of that, it didnt stop me from completing the game by taking my extra lives or restarting me from a previous checkpoint for failing to succeed. Yes Hellblade at the end  completely bends this rule by putting you in a battle that you cant win. But it doesnt break the rule either. You dont suffer setbacks like loss of life, ammo or other important tools fighting and losing this impossible fight. There is a reason for the impossible to be in Hellblade. It was put there because it made sense to be there. You are suppose to give up.

Now if you agree with me on parameters being an important foundation for any game not just a good one. Think about all the times SOD2 has left you scratching your head. Not understanding how things happened the way they happened. Or even worse why it was even allowed to happen in the first place. At no time is it acceptable to be dealing situations that will hurt the immersion of a game. Like insta bloaters or conviently spawned hostiles in Nightmare. There are the pop up horde and freak horde spawns. But normal hordes are easy enough to deal with so it's not that bad. But when those instant spawns are Plague juggs or ferals or any other enemy that takes distinct tactics in order to manage them other than just swing melee weapons, the bad spawning starts to be an unfair advantage in favor for the game.

No matter how much you think you've prepared for a scavenging run nothing can prepare you for a headshot from a Nightmare hostile 3 houses away that the game doesnt always warn you about. Some people say you dont need to be warned about hostiles. You should  always think they're in every home. But why? Doesnt make any sense to me. If I'm to think that way through out the whole game then shouldn't I suit all the way up everytime, before I enter any building? I mean with the limited everything in the game including carrying capacity, wouldn't that mentality make the game more of a grind than a experience? Considering most if not all carrying slots would already be occupied with survival items. I'm not talking about Hostile missions. In Nightmare they are superhuman, super accurate, and super lethal. When you accept a mission to fight them you should know what to expect and prepare accordingly because they are so deadly. But it is because they can kill you so quickly that a bad spawning system makes it much worse. There are times they can take you out before you can even locate them. And that's not right. If it's a problem with rewriting the spawning code then for the time being the hostiles on Nightmare shouldn't be as deadly as they are. And if they are gonna continue to be superhuman then the spawn issue needs to be addressed and handled. Hostiles alone keep some players from completely experiencing the game. Completely ignoring hostile missions all together. Out of fear of losing a survivor to their lethality. And they definitely dont want hostiles conveniently materializing in a house 100 feet away during a horde fight. But this kind of thing still exists in Nightmare since they launched.

Maybe it's just me.",StateOfDecay,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/StateOfDecay/comments/pbbg6n/sod2_experience/,,NearbyIssue629,pbbg6n,/r/StateOfDecay/comments/pbbg6n/sod2_experience/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StateOfDecay/comments/pbbg6n/sod2_experience/,2,2021-08-25

House project series 5 capacity 7 exterior view,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nbntwebumtb71.png?width=2415&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b38741fc45fb985b2b4263a63633589d557bed22

In terms of my writing timeline, it‚Äôs only been two days since I was last working on series 5, but it definitely feels like more than that. The diagram for today is an updated exterior view after the latest round of changes. As usual, I had some difficulties with getting the window spacing correct, but that should be all sorted out. Removing the lightwell has simplified the transition between the garage roof and the main living volume roof was well as reducing the surface area, and the exit on the non-garage side is no longer on the centerline. I am not thinking of much else to say that is directly related to the diagram, so I will instead bring up the issue of inaccessible volumes. My current idea is that both the triangular prism-shaped structure over the garage roof and main living volume roof would not be accessible under normal circumstances (without getting a saw and/or prybar involved). These types of enclosed volumes are universal in the building construction methods that I am familiar with, and a major example of this would be the interiors of walls. Roofs also tend to have volumes between the exterior skin of the building and the interior/accessible volume, and these volumes need to be vented to prevent mold problems. In the house concept that I have been working on, the main roof is 1.2 meters in height. I am currently expecting 0.4 meters of this to be consumed by the continuous interior and exterior surfaces and the structure behind them, which leaves 0.8 meters of air gap. If we then add a 0.05 meter tall continuous divider, we get one 0.4 meter tall volume and one 0.35 meter tall volume. I suppose that the main problem with this is that these spaces are beginning to sound like an ideal home for local wildlife, which is something that needs to be prevented as much as possible. However, I would have to imagine that keeping the wildlife out is a goal that is shared by anyone trying to build a building and that the spaces I have drawn are capable of being sealed against wildlife and vented at the same time.

Moving back to parenting and schooling, I am going to have to figure out where I left off and where I was intending to go. At this point, the most appropriate topic seems to how administrative realities get disconnected from what is actually true, which is also an issue that impacted my time in school. On an individual level, the most concerning way that administrative realities can become distorted is when administrators attempt to apply the patterns that they may be seeing or would like to be seeing to situations instead of doing the work to analyze each situation individually. Doing a unique analysis each time is the only way to ensure that appropriate actions are taken, but on the other hand the effort needed to do this detracts from a person‚Äôs ability to participate in office politics, push an agenda into their work, inflict unnecessary cruelty on the people unfortunate enough to fall under their control, and so on. Also, the elements present in or the context of an individual situation will usually be familiar even though each situation is unique, so it is tempting to reuse earlier conclusions instead of working in the same conceptual space on a repetitive basis. I personally handle this by reminding myself that the person I am writing to or talking with could very well been completely ignorant of or inexperienced with the context, which results in me explaining things that I think ought to be obvious. Repetitively explaining the same concept in slightly different contexts can get tedious and/or depressing, but on the one hand making yourself go to the effort of applying the concept to the context is an essential part of actually understanding an individual event. On the other our species went to the effort of developing antidepressant medications precisely for situations like this, and if you do a significant amount of abstract thought my opinion is that you probably need to be taking antidepressants.

The main problem with abstract thought is that everything eventually leads back to the inevitable heat death of the universe, and if you consider a large enough scale in time and distance it is relatively easy to decide that nothing humans do matters to the universe. I have no idea whether or not this is true, but what I can definitely tell you is that actions taken by humans matter to other humans. With antidepressants, this becomes engaging and a reason to communicate with other humans, without antidepressants you tend to become overwhelmed and start to think of yourself and everyone around you as pathetic creatures worthy of your contempt. In an administrative context, ‚Äúnothing matters in the big picture‚Äù can rapidly become an excuse to take whatever action makes your life as easy as possible regardless of the situational appropriateness of this action, the impact it will have on whoever you are dealing with, and so on. In other words, we are back to doing a bare minimum of pattern recognition in order to avoid the work of properly analyzing a situation.

As a student with a brain that has not fully developed, dealing with this type of behavior on the part of school administrators can be challenging. You have two basic options: give up your humanity (temporarily or permanently) and play along with the perceived realities of the people with power over you or try to keep track of actual reality. The former means finding a difficult balance between the competing perceived realities of your teachers/administrators/etc, the latter means accepting the fact that all of the people doing their best to live in their own perceived realities are going to go out of their way to interpret your actions in the worst possible light. As a result, you will have to accept the fact that you will be dealing with people who consider you their enemy but also have the power to inflict significant cruelty on you if you do not go out of your way to be nice to them. Dealing with this in the absence of parental support is absolutely infuriating, and the situation is made worse by the overlap in other people‚Äôs perceived realities and their willingness to collectively tell obvious and absurd lies (‚Äúthis reading was also in error and we knew it had to be‚Äù).

At this point, I am having difficulties in continuing the schooling discussion. I have also been distracted by the existence of nuclear accidents, and I am thinking that I would like to look into the Three Mile Island partial meltdown of an electrical reactor in 1979. As a result, I am probably not going to be doing any writing to accompany the last four diagrams in series 5, which should not pose too much of an issue because I was mostly catching up with the changes I had made earlier in series 5. I will note that I ended up reversing the orientation of the bulkheads in the second half of the bulkhead diagram, and my hope was that this would improve readability. Looking at the result a few days later, I am not sure if this happened or not, and the bulkhead diagram definitely seems too densely packed even after spacing increases. In any case, I‚Äôll pick back up with the writing on 30 August 2021.",SpaceXFactCheck,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXFactCheck/comments/pbgn4t/house_project_series_5_capacity_7_exterior_view/,,FightingForSarah,pbgn4t,/r/SpaceXFactCheck/comments/pbgn4t/house_project_series_5_capacity_7_exterior_view/,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXFactCheck/comments/pbgn4t/house_project_series_5_capacity_7_exterior_view/,0,2021-08-25

[24F4A] Caught in an alley at night,"It was 3am on a Friday night as I hurriedly made my way through the streets to get home. I had just been at a party with some of my friends, but it was getting to that stage of the night where all they wanted to do was sniff coke around a table, which was no fun to me. I couldn't afford a taxi, so I thought to myself I'd just walk for 20 minutes and get home. I'd done it plenty of times before, so it wasn't an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a small girl, standing at just 5'0, but what I was lacking in height, I had in other areas. I was rather slim but with a natural 32D bust, and a tight, round arse that I worked hard for in the gym. My skin was pale and freckly, my hair was shoulder length, dyed blonde from my original light brown, and naturally curly. My green eyes stood out from my pale skin and I possessed no tattoos. All I was wearing was a rather short, low-cut, tight red dress. No bra and just a matching coloured red thong underneath. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whilst checking my phone, I noticed footsteps behind me. I looked behind, and saw someone who was a few yards away, although they didn't look like they were following me. They didn't seem to be focused on me at all. Still, I felt uneasy. I walked at a quicker pace and decided to take a shortcut through the alley. As I got halfway through the alley, I looked behind and saw nobody, nor did I hear any steps.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was about to exit the alley, somebody came from around the corner and grabbed me by my hair, yanking it back roughly and putting their other hand over my mouth to muffle my scream. I screamed as loud as I could, but I didn't think anybody was around. He roughly pushed me up against a large dumpster bin and pulled my dress upwards as I tried to struggle. He tore my thong off and stuffed it in my mouth, as he kissed my neck and groped my breasts. I could feel him hardening against me, and hated the part of me that got wet from this. My heart was thumping, and I couldn't tell if it was from fear or excitement. Still screaming, albeit muffled, I look straight over his shoulder and saw somebody walking by the alley. I wasn't sure if they had seen me, and I tried to scream louder, hoping to get their attention and get some help.

&amp;#x200B;

(Thank you for reading! So, I have a couple of ideas for how this can play out. You can walk by and come help me, scaring the man away. You can then force yourself upon me or we can play things more naturally. You could watch what happens and let it unfold, maybe you even want to join in. Or, if you've got any other ideas, let's discuss them! Kinks: Non-con, roughness, public sex, spitting, degradation.)",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pbgnul/24f4a_caught_in_an_alley_at_night/,,rwpdxo,pbgnul,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pbgnul/24f4a_caught_in_an_alley_at_night/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pbgnul/24f4a_caught_in_an_alley_at_night/,0,2021-08-25

*Story is based around blackmail.*  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
This group of friends having known each other since they were kids had always been together, grew up together, played together, studied together, went to school together. Pretty much it could be said that they knew each other inside out. This group of 6 being 3 girls and 3 guys, it wasn‚Äôt much surprised to each other and their respective families when the 6 all coupled up with one another eventually. They had all got together when they were in high school and everyone knew the 6 of them as the inseparable group. They were always together and they did everything together.  
  
That was until they all finally went off to university, they had all applied for the same one and managed to each get a spot in their respective faculties. Even renting a house off campus to live together, it was a nice 3 bedroom place which meant that each couple had their own private room to stay in. When the semester had started and it wasn‚Äôt long before the 3 asian girls were noticed on campus, many soon take to recognizing the 3 of them Germaine, Jasmin &amp; Isabella as the hottest Asian freshmen girls of that year. Other freshmen and seniors took it to get to know the girls and were more than disappointed when they learned that all 3 of them had boyfriends and it was hard for them to fathom how did 3 solid 11‚Äôs end up being with such skinny Asian guys as their boyfriends.  
  
For Alex, Michael and Tab it didn‚Äôt matter to them how the rest of the students on campus look at them or talk bad behind their backs. As at the end of the day all 3 of the girls were going back home with each of them and they were the guys that were enjoying their respective girlfriends in bed. So for all they cared the rest of campus can just suck it up. Yet that was until the guys from the university‚Äôs football team when they learnt of the 3 asian beauties and saw them for the first time on campus. It became pretty well known after that how the 3 girls were actively always helping people and being kind and sweet people in general which the team then took it upon themselves to take advantage of this.  
  
Where about 2 weeks into the semester as Alex had just finished his class and it was already 6PM and pretty dark at the time already. Making his way through campus heading to the building in which Jasmin was finished with her class as well and waiting for him. Yet as he passed in between 2 buildings which had a narrow winding pathway between them and out of sight, he was suddenly ganged up on by atleast 4 big burly guys and loud thumps of fists and feet connecting with his body could be heard.   
  
In the end when he finally turned up to where he was to meet Jasmin whom had started to get worried as he was never late, by the time he turned up he was bruised and bloody much to her utter shock. As she quickly helped him and got him back to their home where the other 2 couples as well were shocked to see him in that state as they all helped him as best as they could. They asked him if he could recognize who were the people that had beaten him up but he couldn‚Äôt see them at all not with the darkness of the time. In the end they had went back to campus the next day and reported it to the administration but because of the place it happened and the time it was highly doubtful that they could figure out who the attackers were and with no idea why anyone would attack him as well it was taken under advisement and that was it.  
  
Until about two days later as Germaine, Jasmin and Isabella were all sitting around one of the park tables that was on campus as they chatted away. Only to notice as a group of big burly guys that had the university‚Äôs football sports team jacket on them heading their way. They all knew that the team had a bad reputation for partying, drinking, doing drugs and of the way they use girls for nothing else other than for sexual playthings. So they decided to just ask them to go away and ignore them when they were finally next to them yet before they could do so one of them a big tall white guy that they presumed to be the captain of the football team spoke first.  
  
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶.how did you guys like seeing the way that Alex was dealt with? He‚Äôs your boyfriend right‚Ä¶erm‚Ä¶Jasmin?‚Äù  
  
The girls were confused for a second before they finally caught on to what he was saying.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶.it was you guys?! I‚Äôm going to report all of you!‚Äù Jasmin with a face full of rage stood right up and was about to head to the administration office with the other two as well showing disgusted looks on their faces  
  
‚ÄúReally? Well‚Ä¶if your so sure that you‚Äôd be able to report us but what evidence is there? Because we can just get away before you guys even get to the office. Not to mention would you want your boyfriends to get further dealt with? I‚Äôm sure Michael and Tab as well would love to be introduce to our fists and feet too?‚Äù  
  
The girls stopped in their tracks as they couldn‚Äôt believe they were being threatened right then by these assholes yet seeing the build on these guys, they had no doubt at all that their boyfriends wouldn‚Äôt be able to resist the team at all. Not to mention they didn‚Äôt want to see their boys get hurt as well.  
  
‚ÄúWhy? Why are all of you doing this to them? They‚Äôve never done anything wrong to all of you!‚Äù Isabella said with both worry and anger in her sweet voice.  
‚ÄúWhat do you mean nothing? Of course they have! Their keeping hot bitches like you to themselves! If anything that‚Äôs a crime in itself!‚Äù The captain said as he eyed their bodies up and down which sent shivers of disgust through the girls as they see this pervert eyeing them like pieces of meat.  
  
‚ÄúWho we are with is none of you or anyone‚Äôs business!‚Äù Germaine took her turn to shout back pretty loudly yet because of the part of campus they were not there wasn‚Äôt much people walking around at that time of the day  
  
‚ÄúWell look at it this way. If you three want your boyfriends to be beaten up to a pulp then go right away with this stupid bitchy attitude the 3 of you are showing us now.‚Äù The captain now spoke with a deadpan face and with a voice that was showing his irritation now at being spoken to so rudely by them  
  
Seeing his seriousness the girls realized he wasn‚Äôt joking at all and started to get scared now and became less aggressive to him and the other team members. ‚ÄúWhat? What is it that you all want?‚Äù Jasmin said not understanding at all what these guys wanted.  
  
‚ÄúWhy it‚Äôs simple. We‚Äôre having a big party tonight over at our frat house. You guys should know Alpha Phi Epi Chu right? All 3 of you will come to the party tonight and oh dressed as sexy as you girls can. Cant be downers now can we? With those bodies you three have you all should be showing it off for me and the boys to enjoy you know?‚Äù Licking his lips in a highly sexual manner which terrified the girls  
  
‚ÄúNO ABSOLUTELY NOT!‚Äù All three girls shouted out together  
  
‚ÄúFine suit yourselves. I hope one of your boyfriends don‚Äôt die from being ganged up on by the whole football team.‚Äù As they started to turn around to leave but hearing how that one of their boyfriends might actually die quickly reminded them how they had no choice at all.  
  
‚ÄúWait!....We‚Ä¶.we‚Äôll turn up at the party‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs over at Collins street right?‚Äù Isabella quickly called out to them  
  
Smiling to himself widely as the captain managed to get what he wanted as he nodded his head making his way back as he stood next to Jasmin. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right you guys cant miss the music, people and atmosphere of the place once your around there.‚Äù Seeing how this hot petite Asian babe only was up to his chest in height as he brought his hand to rest on her lower back which made her almost want to throw a slap at his face as she felt his hand on her body but she reminded herself her boyfriends life was at stake here.  
‚ÄúWell we‚Äôll see you girls tonight ok? Remember sexy! Figure out some lie to tell to your boyfriends I don‚Äôt care what or how because you three wont be going back home tonight! If I were you three I‚Äôd probably head to the pharmacy to get some Plan B because there‚Äôs going to be a lot of action tonight.‚Äù Winking as he brought his hand down onto Jasmin‚Äôs ass and gave one of her ass cheeks a hard squeeze before spanking her   
  
‚ÄúMhmm nice and supple. Cant wait to see Alex‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äôs ass bouncing on my cock. See you babes later.‚Äù As he and his guys left leaving the three of them in shock hearing the suggestion to buy a morning after pill as they realized they‚Äôve been blackmailed into going to a party tonight that will more than likely end up having sex. They wanted to just forget it all and report them all to the police but like they said there was no evidence and most of all they cant risk the safety of their boyfriends too.

"Daredevil will be Peter's lawyer, Dr Strange is not the real one and his spell fails because of the timelines","I think that:

1. Dr Strange fails his spell because it goes in contrast with other timelines
2. Dr Strange is not the real one
3. Dottor Octopus says ""Hello Peter"" but he does not know who is the current    Spiderman (he doesn't refer to the spiderman interpreted by Tom)
4. Matt ""Daredevil"" Murdock will be is lawyer
5. In    the new trailer of Spiderman No Way Home we see that Spiderman asks  Dr   Strange to wipe from the memory of the people that he is spiderman.  
Then    Strange try to perform his spell but Peter has an afterthought  because   he understood that every single person in the timeline will  forget the   identity of spiderman including MJ, May Parker and all his  friends.  
Afterwards we see that Peter starts talking and Strange asks him to stop or the spell won't succed and, in fact, it does not.

I    think that the spell does not go well because other timelines go in    contrast with what Strange is trying to do by performing it.  
Basically    the exact moment in which Strange performs the spell is synced with   the  moment shown in the last episode of the Loki tv series in which the    sacred timeline breaches which is also synced with the exact time of   the  battle between Wanda and Agatha.  
As a matter of fact, at the    beginning of the spell we can see that Strange picks a single line that    rapresents the sacred timeline but then something goes wrong (breach  of   the sacred timeline) and it does split into different timelines.

Also we can hear at 2.18 of the trailer that Dr Strange says: ""The problem is you trying to live two different lives"".

2) Also I think that he is not the real Dr Strange because:  
\- He said to Wong that he was not performing the spell but then he still does it  
\-    He knows this is a very dangerous spell so why does he perform the    spell? So the same Dr Strange that did the impossibile to save the time    stone is ""messing around"" with the timelines?  
\- In the trailer of Spiderman No Way Home (trains scene) we can see that Strange is not actually helping Peter  
\- Why doesn't he wear the usual red and blue costume? In this scene it is black.

3)    In the trailer, Dottor Octopus says ""Hi Peter"" like it is not the   first  time he meets him but actually he should not know who he is   because he  has never met the current spiderman...  
So, probably, he is greeting the Spiderman of ""his timeline"" who is the one interpreted by Tobey Maguire.

4)    At 0.31 of the trailer we see that Peter doesn't notice that someone    (probably his lawyer considering the circumstances) is there and it is    weird since he should have spider senses.  
The only one person that  he   couldn't be able to hear should be a person that has superhuman  senses   and able to not show his movements (already done in the  Daredevil tv   series while fighting against The Hand's ninjas).  
Also,  we can see in   a old short that Peter is taking his costume from the  laundry but the   worker (Jimmy Kimmel) shows him the mask of Daredevil.  YT: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE6nrwxvcEM&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE6nrwxvcEM&amp;t=1s)  
This    video is very old (June 10th 2019) but it makes sense because at that    time there were rights issues about the character of Daredevil so  they   had to wait 2 years since the tv show got deleted from netflix  (2018).

Also,   at 1.16 of the  trailer we can see that Peter is not acting like usual   and also he is  wearing a black costume. He is running heading the   direction that a  worker was pointing out so, maybe, he is chasing   someone.

"[F4M] [Detailed, Literate] Romance, Backstabbing, and political plots in the House of Commons","***DISCLAIMER: This rp is based heavily on the political system of the United Kingdom, and its associated parties, though I would be happy to rp with anybody willing to take a twist and play as someone from another country, whether that be from the US or closer to home. All political opinions are welcome for this rp, as long as you are decent, committed, and an interested writer.***

***Enjoy!***

The glorious arches of the Palace of Westminster never seized to amaze you, highlighted by the morning sun peeking up over the rooftops and spires, shadows cast from the Abbey of Westminster, and the government buildings opposite. The river was calm and majestic, snaking its way through the city like a serpent, and the great, gothic building stood proudly to defend the people from the slithering snake itself. It's windows were glistening, and its beautiful stone delightful in the light. The buses bustled away, and people plodded to and fro, making their way to office jobs, and Costa Coffees, and all that loveliness.

Except, you weren't going to a Costa Coffee. Or even a starbucks. You walked straight through the oh-so familiar iron gate, past the bumbling police officer, and into the chaos. Waving papers, dapper insults and well-crafted remarks are the name of the game, and every day was a show. The whole place was a well-placed Soap Opera, appealing to the masses, but its inner workings ludicrously exclusive. A hive of educated minds, humble workmen, bumbling pensioners and overly aggressive *new kids on the block*. It was the best theatre one could hope for - The House of Commons.

Jealous green lined its seats, dark, leering mahogany trimmed to perfection, and the golden centrepiece of HM Mace, the sign of the Crown in the most democratic places in the country.

You heard many a conversation when merely walking through the corridors of the maze, ones between old Etonians, discussing meeting up for a round of Squash, ones of fiery debates in conference rooms - with far too thin doors - and shadow ministers handing out advice to the newcomers.

Yet, you bustled your way through all that, and finally, saw the long corridor and its distinctive side door, opened and the two counters eagerly looking about on either side to see how many Members had turned up. You checked your watch.

*12:07pm.*

*Wednesday.*

Prime Ministers Questions. Noon.

You rush through the doors, and somewhat awkwardly, a round of racous applause erupts from the governments benches, though it wasn't for you. You walked in from behind the speakers chair as always, your preferred side, and listened with intent. The place was still loud and as jeering as it seemed on the Television, high-vaulted walls and rowdy actors making it more engaging than any rock concert.

""The Prime Minister!""

With the call from the Speaker, the governments benches flew into another fit of paper-waving and cheering solidarity, as the familiar figure stood up to the famous old box. Yet, there was another, more interesting figure that  caught your eye.

***Me.***

I was sat two rows back, the only woman on that row - yet, it wasn't the only reason I caught your eye. I was resplendent. Young and pretty, with gorgeous brown locks, coming down past my shoulders. My hazel and green orbs glinted in the fire of debate, a magical sparkle almost always present. My complexion was fair and bright - rosy red cheeks and a skin that looked as smooth as satin or silk. I wore those usual dresses - everything was understated and gloriously subtle. Nothing was ever accentuated too much, nothing ever too risque, no colour, as vivid it may be, ever unpalatable against the tide of black suits and other pops of womanly colour. I was a young, and immensely promising Conservative Politician - stern and stubborn to the best of extents when it came to debates, already serving on several government committees, and was tipped to be the Tories (future) leader, and hopefully, the countries third female Prime Minister. I was ambitious, yet surprisingly likeable. I came from humble backgrounds, yet appealed to everyone. Domineering in speech, shy in person, and immensely pleasing to the eye, I was the key to unlocking votes. Besides, I needn't have worried about leaving anytime soon, I was a notable MP down in the South West, where competition was only between rivalling Conservative Members - an easy monopoly of pensioners, farmers, and Garden-Centre-goers.

Yet, that wasn't what interested you.

You yearned to have those pretty, sexy tennis-playing legs wrapped around you. You lusted for those pretty eyes to gaze upon you with adoring admiration - something that you felt, was somewhat possible. She gave interested gazes now and again, looking across to your usual spot with relative interest. You dreamed of a life where you could love me and shower affectionate kisses and whisper soft-nothings into my ear, and shower me in rose-petals, buy me chocolate and take me to the Ritz for dinner...

***Applause.***

The PM highlighted his desire to increase education spending, knocking you out of your trance and into the monotone approval of Conservative Backbenchers, and furious brow-furrowing of the opposition.

If only. If only you could have her.

If only, you could kiss her.

Kiss me.

Hello, and thanks for reading this far! Hopefully you've enjoyed something rather rare here on this subreddit, and something I've been thinking about doing for a while.

In essence, this is an rp based in Westminster and the tumultous, yet extremely theatric world of British Politics, filled with rivalries, betrayal and that wonderful jazz. I'll play a new, ambitious, Oxford-educated beauty voted onto the Tory Backbenches, and tipped to be a future heavyweight of the Conservative Party.

Who you play? It's up to you. Maybe you are a Labour Back-bencher yourself, tipped with becoming another PM yourself? Are you a fellow Conservative Peer, well-educated and well-spoken, or maybe a smaller party member, fighting for your cause in the corner? You might even want to play a civil servant at Whitehall, a press secretary, or even a journalist enthralled in the world of Westminster. Heck, you could even play a member of the Royal Household, e.g. Royal Private Secretary.

All that matters is - This is a more romantic, more vanilla sort of experience. Two young people in passionate love, wound up in intricate Political backstories and conflicts, making enemies and securing allies, no extreme kinks. Sure, we can have a ***very*** feisty time, but nothing extreme, kapeesh?

Of course, that leads me onto kinks. My kinks for this rp would be: kissing, affection, lingerie, PDA (light), romantic sex, somewhat rough sex, anal, bj's, aftercare, light bdsm, light name-calling, teasing. My limits would be: scat, gore, watersports, incest, extreme violence (in the case of sex, for the plot, I'll allow it), beastiality, and, *MOST IMPORTANTLY,* ***BAD WRITERS.***

Put a bit of effort in, please!

Anyway, enough.

If you like the look of this, send me a message and let's get cracking! No chats by the way, it's a bit odd on my side and woeful to use in general.

Hear from you soon!

When He Left,"Time heals everything, my mother used to say, when the pain of my father‚Äôs absence was still raw. 

Before he disappeared, dad left a folded note for me tucked underneath my pillow that I found the following morning, of blue ink scribbled on paper in dad‚Äôs familiar handwriting.

*I‚Äôm sorry Em, these past few months I‚Äôve been thinking‚Äîand it‚Äôs not your fault‚Äîit‚Äôs just, I wanted to start over. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm doing it without you. There‚Äôs no excuse for it, I know. Just tell your mother I‚Äôm sorry. And please don‚Äôt blame yourself Emily. Bye.* 

And that was the end of it, the resolute terms he‚Äôd signed off on. I laughed then, hysterical, gasping laughter that reduced to panicked, raspy breaths. 

The first thought on my reeling mind was *this is a prank*. There was no way‚Äî

Yet as I flung my parents‚Äô bedroom door open and stepped inside to find my mother sleeping soundly in the sheets, my fears were made palpable. The spot next to mom was bare. 

Gone.

After jolting my mother awake, I wordlessly handed her the note to see what she made of it.

Her brows knotted as her squinted eyes scanned the page, mouth widening with each word. At the end of the note, she cradled her head in her hand, then swiftly perked up and grabbed her phone from the bedside table. She dialed a number.

The phone on the receiving end rang‚Äîfrom inside the bedroom closet. That‚Äôs where he left it. Guess he didn‚Äôt want to be contacted.

At first mom was devastated, and we embraced each other for the longest time. 

Mom voiced her disbelief, trying to piece together why he left. Their marriage had taken a dip sure, but she said they were finding ways to rekindle it. Yes, there were moments of doubt. The times dad came home late‚Äîwork he said. That time she plucked a strand of blonde hair from dad‚Äôs shirt collar. Other instances, tiny and easily dismissed. What if he got bored and found a better sideshow? 

Upon reaching that depressing conclusion, mom‚Äôs shoulders fell, and she drew out a heavy sigh. And yet, a few moments later, with a steely resolve, she stopped crying. She puffed her chest and said, ‚ÄúFine. If the bastard wants to leave because he thinks we‚Äôre not enough for him, it‚Äôs his loss.‚Äù 

And that‚Äôs how mom was after that: resilient; strong even when I couldn‚Äôt be. Even when I my mind was still reeling from the hurt clawing at my heart.

I remember what mom would say when I broke out in unprompted tears. She‚Äôd hug me and tell me it would get better because *time heals everything.*

But she‚Äôs wrong.

It spoils things. With time, everything rots, including my wounded heart. 

And time certainly did a number on dad‚Äôs body in the garden, embedded next to the tulips, but not enough to erode the evidence.",shortscarystories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/pbhz7o/when_he_left/,,KagoM_,pbhz7o,/r/shortscarystories/comments/pbhz7o/when_he_left/,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/pbhz7o/when_he_left/,0,2021-08-25

I (28M) am no longer sexually attracted to my wife (27F),"Before you all get on my case about ""yet another guy shaming his wife's body"" or something like that. It's not about that. My wife is rather fit and beautiful for 27 and she's physically attractive enough to turn me on. My problem is in another category.  
The sexual intimacy is gone for me. When I think about having sex, I'm just not really interested right now. This is a recent thing for me.  
Previously, I was gung ho about sex. I still have an active sex drive and feel the want to have sex, but not with my wife. I think the reason is the layers of complication with doing so.  
1. My wife shows irritation (or at the very least, strong reluctance) to participate in sex  
2. Even when my wife initiates, sex is frequently awkward because she finds something that makes her uncomfortable or turns her off when we're in the act. It frequently feels like she's trying to ""get it over with"".  
3. Working with her on the issues that make her uncomfortable works for a while, but a new issue always seems to arise, there is never a ""that was just great"" after sex feeling. It always feels like some hurdle had to be overcome.  
4. Working with a therapist has helped, but we have found there continues to be a constant reluctance for sex on my wife's part and that is creating more and more of these hurdles.  
I hope the fact that I mentioned in point 4 that there is a therapist involved that we can move past point 2 and not go down a million edge cases of ""me being some insane sex freak who asks for unhealthy sexual acts"".  
When I think about having sex now, what I feel is ""yeah, sex!"" and then the thought of all the complications involved, the likely multiple days of rejections before we get around to it, the issues that will happen during, etc. I just don't want to deal with all of it anymore. My hard-on disappears and I go find something else to do.  
I've tried doing the whole romance her and try it then, but there are frequent rejections even when we are being romantic and ""the time is right"". We've talked about this and my wife who has ADHD finds it difficult to ""stay in the moment"", so this is a big difficulty for her to want sex. The therapist is working with her on this, but progress is slow if it happens at all. Neurotypes are no joke.  
After several years of open communication, therapy, and hard work both sexually and in improving our marriage and myself, I'm just honestly not interested in sex with her anymore.  
So here's where folks ask ""how healthy is your marriage?""  
The answer is, it's not terrible or anything, but there are a mix of ups and downs like most marriages. The main thing I think could be contributing to me not wanting sex is something I've noticed about my relationship with my wife.  
My wife is excited to see other people, but she seems very ""blah"" around me. You know when you're out with friends and your spouse is all smiles with the group, but when you get home, they're just blank faced. I don't really see the upbeat, happy wife when it's just us.   
I figured this was because I was dropping the ball on my end. So I stepped up my game over the last couple years.  
I worked out a lot to stay fit so I'd be sexually attractive. I improved my hygiene so that she wouldn't be grossed out by me (I was never bad, but improvement is always welcome). I started doing more activities with her. We go on dates almost every weekend. I've planned more stuff to have friends and family over and improve our social life. I've been trying to be more fun to hang out with by improving my attitude through self reflection, meditation, etc. I've also tried to romance her more, be more affectionate. Lastly, I've tried to take some of the stresses in our life away, I handled most of the day-to-day things in our household, but I stepped up a bit more to lead a bit more than usual and just get even more of the usual distractions out of the way so we could focus on each other. Lastly, I've pushed a bit more at work (while maintaining sane work hours) and gotten a couple promotions recently. All in all, if you were the outside looking in, you'd think our marriage was a successful story.  
Also, we don't have kids, so no stress there and my wife also does not want kids, she wants a career and our dogs.  
Despite all this, I do notice she still doesn't seem to respect me or consider me a priority. Despite the fact I'm stepping up to the plate, her mind just seems elsewhere. She's mostly focused on work and her tablet/phone. I'm just a second thought to everything else going on in her life. Anyone who knows anything about marriage knows this is a problem. We've talked about it, she doesn't have much to divulge other than ""she's stressed"" and ""has anxiety"". Therapy is trying to help her work through this, but it just seems to be her baseline mental mood in our marriage.  
At this point, I'm almost about ready to give up on us entirely. You read all the ""make sure it's not you"" things and ""talk with your partner"" things and then ""go to therapy"" things and ""work hard and give it a chance"" things. This whole situation and current result feels a bit like ""you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink"" moments.  
Is this a fair time to just quit? I don't like living a sunk-cost fallacy if it's just over. I feel like my reluctance for sex with my wife is the final indicator this might be a lost cause. My body might be telling me something. You sometimes have to listen to your gut even if your head keeps trying to ""problem solve"" the situation.  
tldr; My wife is low-key rejecting me as a person and any advances I make. I've worked hard to improve the situation, but her reluctance to work with me has created a reluctance in me to want to be intimate with her. Is this the end of our marriage?",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pbhhbh/i_28m_am_no_longer_sexually_attracted_to_my_wife/,,ThrowRA-attraction89,pbhhbh,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pbhhbh/i_28m_am_no_longer_sexually_attracted_to_my_wife/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pbhhbh/i_28m_am_no_longer_sexually_attracted_to_my_wife/,0,2021-08-25
ML21 Recap heading into home stretch (3WG pt 3),"Before we begin our journey, I should mention one thing. I played a big part in the reporting of the Steeplechase error. After another user posted it here I initially dismissed it, but after rewatching the event that user was right. I brought it up to Novawolf who then posted that the table would be fixed but not until the final event. I'll be dammed if that point makes a big difference between who wins/podiums. Right now it does not, the only change was between 12 and 13 that had to be swapped. I'll cover that more in the Savage Speeders and Gliding Glaciers sections. Anyway let's get rolling.

(This post covers Triathlon, Steeplechase, Sand Moguls, and Diving)

**16. Rojo Rollers (57 pts, 1B, 1L, 2T): Rojo Rolled Off**

The Rojo Rollers have had a disaster of a season. Somehow they are not eliminated yet but expect them to be soon unless they win the last four events and everyone else chokes namely. At 57 points the Rojo Rollers would have a worse score through 12 events than the Quicksilvers did in 2017 and they retired. In fact they have less points at this stage than the Noceanics did, though the last quarter for them was the worst. Their goal is to get 13 or more points to avoid the dubious distinction of worst single season ML team of all time. Does not help when Rojo Tres gets bumped off the track by Blue Eye during the Triathlon. It does bug me but not as much considering the Rojos aren't contending for anything except for Lead Cube. Speaking of Rojo Tres it does not help that they finished dead last in the Moguls either. Yeah this really does feel like a wasted spot and that is with a medal a while back. 

**15. Minty Maniacs (61 pts, 2T, 1Z): Nine Nine Nine**

Yeah I'm not wasting any time with you. The Minties have been one of the worst teams and a huge disappointment. Remember when we made fun of Team Galacfifth? How about Minty Manineacs? They have finished 9th 5 times now one short of Galactic's 5th place finishes in 2020.  Here's the real concerning part, ONE TOP HALF FINISH. There have been 12 events and the Minties only top half finish was a 6th in Relay. That's why I don't want to write about them anymore. 

**14. Limers (73 pts, 1B, 4Z): Another Trash Season**

The Limers being one of the worst teams is no surprise. This quarter was as bad as their first quarter though they did get a couple middle finishes including a 6th in the Triathlon by Goolime. Still it's projected to be another trash season for the Limers. They are the only team to never have a single digit placement at the end of a tournament and that includes the Showdown. Oh and add another event that the Limers were good at but not anymore and that's the Diving. They got a bronze back in 2016 but with a more centralized format they finish 11th. Should've been the Kobalts as they were a better competitor than the Limers. 

**13. Gliding Glaciers (93 pts, 2B, 1L, 2T): The Marble Texans**

What do I mean when I say the Gliding Glaciers are the marble equivalent of the Houston Texans? Simple they had a strong first quarter of the season, that was followed by a second quarter that buried any chances of competiting, and now they have to climb out of the hole they dug from that quarter. Sounds familiar? That's the Texans game against the Chiefs in the Divisional that started the downfall of that franchise. Though at least the Gliders are more competitive than Houston is now they have some top half finishes including a 4th in the Diving as well as a 6th in Sand Moguls and 8th in Triathlon. However this is Marble League 2021, and you need medals if you want to contend for a title. Note the standings in the video have the Glaciers in 12th but because of the point adjustment in Steeplechase they drop to 13th and lose the tiebreaker to CCE. Speaking of which...

**12. Crazy Cat's Eyes (93 pts, 1G, 1L, 1T, 2Z): Blue Eye's Wrath**

The entire season for CCE will forever be defined by Blue Eye's disqualification in the Triathlon for knocking Rojo Tres off the track. The worst part is that they would've advance to the semifinal had they not been disqualified which would've given them a small boost up at least to 11th, if they had advance out of that they would've been at least 9th, and had they won it they would've been in 4th. That's how big the disqualification loomed for CCE. They are coming off two near missed on the podium including a 4th in Moguls and 5th in Diving, but the second half swoon has already kicked in and started with a goose egg DSQ. Fortunately they did good in the one Elimination Race so there is a good chance for a medal. Maybe one in the Marblocross as well.

**11. O'rangers (98 pts, 1S, 1B, 1L, 2T): All Came Undoooooone**

Last time we were here the O'rangers were a top 5 teams and ready for their resurgence. Since then they have dropped six spots. This includes a bronze in the Steeplechase and a top half finish for Orangin in the Triathlon. The last two events have been fatal with a 15th in the Moguls and a goose egg in the Diving. You do realize you are supposed to aim for the targets right? I wonder if there is still some trauma not just from blowing that 35 point lead last season, but because of losing to the Oceanics of all teams in a water event. They couldn't hold on to said 35 point lead last season, imagine how it feels being 41 points down with 4 events to go. 

**10. Chocolatiers (104 pts, 1G, 1B, 1T, 1Z): Fulfilling Their Quota**

In the past three Marble League's the Chocolatiers appeared in no team was probably as mediocre as they have been. It seems like there is a two medal quota that was reached when Bonbon got a bronze in the Moguls. Speaking of Bonbon I'd put them as a candidate for one of the top sand marbles considering they stole a spot from the Kobalts after holding off Azure in a photo back in the qualifiers, and this time they stole a podium spot from Green Eye. Besides from that it's been a typical Chocs tournament with mostly midpack finishes and a dismal Steeplechase. The Chocs have never won three medals in the same ML before, could that change?

**9. Hazers (104 pts, 1G, 1S, 2B, 2L, 1Z) Most Inconsistent Team**

For a team that has been known as one of the most consistent teams ever since they joined, 2021 has been the exact opposite for the Hazers. Their last seven events consist of three medals and two last place finishes. Yes the Hazers found another event that they can suck at like in Block Pushing, this time it was Steeplechase. They did get a couple bronze medals lately in both Triathlon and Diving, but one of them stings because Foggy should've had gold in the Triathlon before choking it away. Kinda ironic since they came back last year in the same event. That might be the epitome of the Hazers season, and their team as a whole. Close but not close enough and that is why they have been the Bridesmaid of JMR.  

**8. Shining Swarm (109 pts, 1G, 1B, 1T, 1Z) Being Relevant Again**

Maybe this is the time the Shining Swarm can start to gain fans. The last four events have been decent enough especially Diving where the Swarm rolled over and out to break one of the oldest record in the ML dating back to the Purple Rockets (FINAL ANSWER)! That is only the second gold in their history and one that doesn't have a distraction. Even Glimmer (reserve) put in a decent run during the Triathlon before bombing it in the final. Unfortunately Steeplechase happened but they balanced it out with the gold. This is about on par where most users would probably place the Shining Swarm though their presence in this year's Marble League has been enjoyable. They are just short of their 2017 total but that doesn't take away from how they improved after the past three years.

**7. Indigo Stars (110 pts, 1G, 1S, 1L): A Slight Chance?**

Ah yes, this team, they exist! Enough for me to give you a shoutout along with the team I mentioned above in order to spread awareness of both teams. Though it looks like the Stars have figured themselves out by getting plenty of top half performances including a silver by Gogo in the Moguls. They also have a fifth (Triathlon) and a fourth (Steeplechase) on their record as well before things fell off at Diving. Might be a bit too hard to win the Marble League but I'm not ruling out a podium yet. After all I did predict they would be the dark horse team for this season and it has shown as they are the highest of the six newly promoted teams. The Indigo Stars are just two points shy of their dismal 2019 total when they finished 14th so they will pass that easily. 

**6. Thunderbolts (113 pts): What's Their Plan?**

You know what team the Thunderbolts remind me of? The O‚Äôrangers in 2018. They had a lot of top half performances but only got on the podium once. They nearly stole a podium or even a championship with that strategy but had to settle for 4th. That‚Äôs what I have seen on the Thunderbolts as they... did I just use the same post a third time and the same words? Oh and I guess I can take your comparison to the O'rangers off because they had a medal by now. This is almost a joke by now that the Thunderbolts are still top half and without medals. Now they are the only team without a Lead Cube point. Amazingly, the Thunderbolts have the best average placement rank of any team right now. This is aided by two 4ths, three 5ths, and three 6ths which account for 8 double digit point hauls. Yet because they have zero medals instead of leading they are 26 points behind and pretty much need to swap the O'rangers out with the Midnight Wisps for their 2018 comparison if they want any chance to win or even podium. Because they clearly can't get out of their good funk or bad funk, or whatever they want to call it. There was an odd 11th in Triathlon, then the typical Thunderbolts run of 6th in Steeplechase, 5th in Moguls, and 6th in Diving. I said the Chocs were the most mediocre team in history, but the Thunderbolts may be the most mediocre team this season, or good. I have no idea if they are good or not. Oh and it seems the dumpling addiction spread to Lightning as well.

**5. Savage Speeders (116 pts, 2G, 1Z): One Last Surge?**

This is it Speeders, the time where you will prove whether you are worth of another championship or a podium. Both are easily doable. There's just one problem. I've only seen two good events so far from the Speeders. They got two victories one in the relay from a comeback and then Rapidly decided to throw in a second comeback by winning the Triathlon as well. Aside from those two events what do we have from the Speeders? There's a fourth in Jousting and a 6th in Funnels. That's pretty much it. Take the Triathlon medal out and the last three events are only worth 11 points. And that is with a bailed out point from the Steeplechase incident... oh and a 14th in Diving. Maybe this is what the Speeders want you to think and them boom up they go. That is why they will probably win the Marble League again much to nearly everyone's dismay. Even if that's a stretch a podium is very likely. I can't count them out of either until they are 100% out of it. So keep that in mind as we approach the stretch. If any team can come back the Speeders can.

**4. Green Ducks (117 pts, 1G, 3S, 2L, 1Z): Three Consecutive Silvers**

We've seen a few impressive streaks of three medals in a row, including a couple other times in this Marble League alone. We have never seen a team pick up three of the same medal in consecutive events, in this case silver medals. The Green Ducks started the streak in Block Pushing, then added one from Mallard late in the Triathlon, then got one more in the Steeplechase. That marked the first time any team got three consecutive same medals in JMR history. Because of that it vaulted them all the way to the top 3. While they have cooled off with sub par performances in both Moguls and Diving, the Green Ducks are in a perfect spot if they want to compete for a championship. Already a massive improvement over last year it would spark a redemption story after coming close in 2019. 

**3. Raspberry Racers (133 pts, 1G, 2S, 1B, 1L): A Sour Stretch**

The Raspberry Racers had just come off a Block Pushing gold and were sitting in 2nd when the last post came out. After that they really only had one good event and that was a 5th in the Steeplechase. They did have enough of a point haul from the first half of the season to still be on the projected podium heading into the final four events. Though I am losing confidence if they can make it two out of three championships. They are only six points off the lead so if they can win the Elimination Race and hope that both MY and Momo don't get silver then the lead will be theirs. The last few events are big opportunities for the Razzies as they have also podiumed in both Sand Rally (3rd in 19) and I guess Football if you count Hockey as it's pretty much the same format (won the WML version of it). 

**2. Team Momo (136 pts, 1G, 2S, 1B, 1Z): Least Confident Team**

 ""I do present some danger, they had a 27 point lead after E7. There were two other teams that had a lead bigger than a gold, and both blew it."" I warned you, and you blew it. Not only that Momo blew the lead with four events to spare. The other two teams did it in the final event or the penultimate event. No medals since the Hurdles gold by Momomomo, and only one top half finish since then. Even then that was only a 7th by Mo in the Moguls. All that plus MY's run (more on that later) resulted in Team Momo's lead being wiped out. Here's another thing that I'm concerned about Team Momo. Every other team in the top 6 has podiumed in a ML at least once, except Team Momo who's best season was a 4th in ML16. If they don't medal again they might not podium either especially since one of the teams lurking behind off the podium right now are the Speeders. Even the Ducks could steal it away just as easily. Or maybe it's a secret strategy that I will reveal in the next section.

**1. Mellow Yellow (139 pts, 2G, 2S, 1B, 2L): The Big Surprise**

I was horribly wrong. When I made my prediction at the halfway point I had no mention of Mellow Yellow contending for a podium let alone a championship. The reason: They were too inconsistent just like in 2020. As soon as I made that post, they started with a dismal 13th in the Triathlon proving my point right. Then they followed it by winning the Steeplechase which made me think ok they balanced it out again just like earlier. My opinion changed on them as soon as the Moguls happened as Yellow dominated the heat, then the Big Cheese took home MY's second consecutive gold medal becoming only the fifth team in ML history to win consecutive events. All of a sudden they went from 11th to 3rd in two events. As if that wasn't enough they get a silver in the Diving and because of Team Momo and Raspberry Racers coming back to earth, I present to you the new leaders and favorites to win Marble League 2021. u/decumos best ending might end up happening, but there's a catch. No team has ever won the ML while leading at the 3/4 mark whether that be E9 during a 12 event ML or E12 during a 16 event ML. All of those teams did finish on the podium though so I have a good feeling we will be seeing MY there during the CC. How will they do during the final events is unknown but they have a Sand Rally gold on their belt so that could help. No team is hotter than Mellow Yellow is right now heading into the home stretch, and as long as they can keep it up and hold off teams like Team Momo, Raspberry Racers, Green Ducks, and Savage Speeders, then their dream will come true. 

But fun will be cancelled and the Savage Speeders will probably win because that's how things usually are with ML. Mellow Yellow and Raspberry Racers will probably be the other two podium finishers. Sorry Momo and Ducks. Oh and the Thunderbolts will become the first team to finish without a medal or a LC point. Maybe the Indigo Stars and/or Shining Swarm will make things interesting but it's looking pretty hard for either of them to podium let alone win the ML. See you at the finish line.",JellesMarbleRuns,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JellesMarbleRuns/comments/pbi60t/ml21_recap_heading_into_home_stretch_3wg_pt_3/,Marble League,MidnightSpeeder,pbi60t,/r/JellesMarbleRuns/comments/pbi60t/ml21_recap_heading_into_home_stretch_3wg_pt_3/,https://www.reddit.com/r/JellesMarbleRuns/comments/pbi60t/ml21_recap_heading_into_home_stretch_3wg_pt_3/,0,2021-08-25
I am sick of movie trailers and I wish people would stop posting bits of them everywhere.,"This has been the case for quite a while, but the release of the Spider-Man: Far From Home trailer has really blown it up even more. People keep using the trailer to make memes and jokes and I get that it‚Äôs all in good fun but I do not want to see any of it.

For a couple years now, I have refused to watch movie trailers (for movies I already know I want to see). There is no reason for me to spoil even minor plot details while watching a grainy ass video that keeps buffering on my phone screen while sitting on the toilet or laying in bed. It sucks. I would much rather experience these surprises at the theater (or TV if I stream it).

Thor: Ragnarok is one of my favorite MCU movies, but I really wish I had never seen the trailer. It does not take away from the movie, but there are two big surprises that happen in that movie that I really wish I did not know about going in. I‚Äôll try to be vague since the whole point of this post is to avoid even minor spoilers. The two events involve a hammer in one and then a character we had not seen in quite some time in another. These were practically selling points for the movie in the trailer and I get that not everyone is sold right away on seeing these films, but I can only imagine how awesome it would have been to see &gt;!Mjolnir get crushed ‚Äúlike a piece of glass‚Äù by Hela and for Hulk to appear as a 2 years-running gladiatorial champion on Sakaar!&lt; with no prior knowledge. That shit would have been crazy.

There are countless movies that I wish I had never seen the trailer. I may have some form of ADD or ADHD or some other condition that makes me overthink the details I glean from these trailers. When watching a movie, I almost have a checklist in my mind for scenes or lines that were in the trailer. This has gone on for a very long time.

&gt;!When watching The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as a kid, I remember not having any doubt that Aslan‚Äôs death would be undone because I had remembered a moment from the trailer where he was roaring from the top of a cliff while the two Pevensie sisters clung to his back and the sun rises in the distance. In my 8 year old mind, I thought ‚Äúwait we haven‚Äôt seen him roar on the cliff yet, he‚Äôll definitely come back.‚Äù!&lt;

I don‚Äôt even like talking to people who have seen a movie I plan on seeing in any detail whatsoever. A cameo can be a fun moment that has nothing to do with the story, so someone might tell me about it and then go &gt;!‚ÄúWell Sylvester Stallone is hardly even in Guardians 2 so it‚Äôs not a spoiler.‚Äù!&lt; Yes it is, bitch! Knowing that there is a cameo to look for somewhere ruins the surprise I should feel when watching it for the first time. If I know there is a special cameo somewhere, I‚Äôm going to be scanning every scene trying to spot it, and not focus on enjoying the movie. I know this is my problem, but damn.

I don‚Äôt even want to know if someone liked a movie or not. If I know what type of movies they like or dislike, I already have an idea of how I might like it. Similar to seeing ratings before the movie is even out, now I have some expectation or prediction of how I will like it. This is not what I want. I want to go in completely blind.

I have been to a few movies in the theater since things have been opening up (for now at least) and I am considering not going into the theater until all the trailers are done. I wanted to avoid the Shang-Chi trailer as well, and I‚Äôve seen it four times now. &gt;!A pretty powerful character that has been missing since phase 1 of the MCU is in the trailer and I recognized him immediately and went ‚ÄúHOLY SHIT THEY BROUGHT BACK ABOMINATION FINALLY‚Äù and then immediately thought after that ‚ÄúFuck I really wish I had not just seen that.‚Äù!&lt;

I completely understand that the movie industry is a business (facing unprecedented times from the pandemic) and they need to get people excited to see their movie if they want to make any money, but I wish there was a way for me to avoid all of this in peace without entirely cutting myself off from society. I already go on no social media other than Reddit, and Reddit at least has spoiler tags and blocked text to protect from spoilers, but it‚Äôs just not enough.

I have not seen the new Spider-Man: Far From Home trailer and I don‚Äôt want to, but I have gotten several very big details just from memes that are not marked with spoiler tags. These are pretty basic details like which characters are in the movie and which actors are playing them, but those are all surprises I want to experience when I see the damn movie, not in a Family Guy meme. Plus, the movie doesn‚Äôt come out until December! So now I have to avoid all humans and internet for 4 months if I want to enjoy the movie as much as I could have. Oh bother.

I know this is textbook first world problems, but movies are my passion and I wish our society wasn‚Äôt so focused on overhyping things and getting overly excited for releases. I‚Äôm already excited and I will see the movie, stop shoving down my damn throat.",unpopularopinion,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pc1pn9/i_am_sick_of_movie_trailers_and_i_wish_people/,,Jonnyg1c,pc1pn9,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pc1pn9/i_am_sick_of_movie_trailers_and_i_wish_people/,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pc1pn9/i_am_sick_of_movie_trailers_and_i_wish_people/,12,2021-08-26

I hate advertisements period.,"I do not tolerate advertisements of any kind. I actively avoid radio, television, and social media of any sort. Been this way since 2010 roughly. They aren't compensating or benefitting me at all. If anything it is all a distraction or a complete waste of time. I pay no attention to it and continue with my life.

When at home I use programs and applications to auto block ads on my own devices. If I am unable to block using software/hardware combinations than ill pay for it, but to date only this site is able to get away with that. 

As for ads on speakers or TVs in public, for example the dental offices, restaurants, or grocery stores, I tune that out with some headphones and good music. My personal music libraries don't contain ads, and don't require internet connection.",unpopularopinion,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pbsx4t/i_hate_advertisements_period/,,Slappynipples,pbsx4t,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pbsx4t/i_hate_advertisements_period/,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pbsx4t/i_hate_advertisements_period/,2,2021-08-26
"Back here again. Still in poverty, still suicidal; no money, no college, no family, no hope.","I've posted here before I think? Anyways, back here again because surprise, life didn't get better.

29, trans, impoverished, came from extremely abusive and neglectful family, yadda yadda yadda.

I have absolutely no money for college and I don't even know what I'd want to DO for the rest of my life. I kinda hate capitalism and how we have to slave away at jobs that treat us like shit for our whole lives, but I'd like to make livable money off it. Ah, but I'm too fucking poor (and too old) to go to college. Is it obvious I'm American?

Anyways, money is life, and I'm basically already dead since I have no money. I'm sick of working shitty minimum wage jobs that treat me like absolute dogshit for barely any money, but there's no hope of ever getting out of these shitty jobs. No, I have no monetizable skills. the only 'skill' I have is art, and I'm not good enough a that to make real money.

And since I have no money and never will, I can't transition, I can't fix my stupid teeth, I can't go to therapy, I can't eat real food, I can't ENJOY life, I can't have the comfort of a stable home situation with a stable income. I'm sick of it.

I think of myself as a wounded dog who's so  messed up, it's just better to mercy kill it, you know? I'm that dog. I don't want to live for the next few decades exactly as I am now; struggling, starving, unhappy, and unloved. That's so cruel, and I'm already in agony every day of my life that I don't have money.

Oh and side note: I'm such a worthless, hideous, poor piece of shit that nobody will ever love me, and I don't blame them one bit. I don't try to date because I'm not good for it and it'd be a waste of both our time. Plus, now I'll be dead soon.

'Soon' is relative though. I'm giving it 2 more years. This will give me time to either make money (yeah right) or finalize plans for killing myself. Killing myself is the only thing I have true control over, I realized, and that makes me kind of happy. Like wow, I can actually DO something I plan for, instead of being too poor for it, for once!

Basically, I'm already 30 so my best years are behind me (miss me with that 'your 30s are the best' crap). It's too late and impossible to go to college and I'm too stupid for business and too physically weak for manual labor jobs. I have no family to fall back on, no big inheritance coming my way from ANYONE, and.. yeah! Gonna kill myself. There's absolutely no way out of this situation short of winning the lottery or offing myself, and we all know which one I can do with 100% certainty. Basically, I have absolutely nothing to work with and the worst luck on the planet.

I need help,"I need help. I am a 57 yr old woman with no previous addiction problems. I‚Äôm not even sure how it happened but I stumbled across easy assess to reliable, high quality drugs ordered online and delivered by special delivery. I buy cocaine 14g at a time because it works out cheaper. That lasts me about 2 months. 
I‚Äôve been using cocaine every day for nearly a year. 1g lasts me about 3.5 days, so it‚Äôs about 0.3g every day. I also started smoking about a year ago, after 23 years of being a non smoker, also because I could buy them cheaply. 

My daily routine
Get up with about 15 minutes to spare before I have to leave for work. Make strong coffee with Baileys type cream liqueur instead of milk, also make travel mug of coffee with Baileys to take with me. Have a snort. Drive to work. Smoke cigarette on way. Throughout day, sniff every hour or so. I‚Äôm able to pop home during day in between jobs so always have a quick coffee with baileys. Sniff every time I think about it and smoke cigarettes when I can. Finish work at 4pm, go home, have coffee with baileys, sniff and cigarettes. Do jobs around house and garden, smoking and sniffing whenever I fancy it. Settle down about 8ish and have 1 or 2 strong hash joints. Don‚Äôt usually have any more coke after about 7-8pm ish. Get nicely stoned. Just before I go to bed, I have half a Quetiapine (25mgs) (not prescribed) to help me sleep. Usually go into deep sleep. Struggle to get up when alarm goes off in the morning, just about get up in time and repeat every weekday. Weekends are no different expect I can lay in until 11ish but then same routine. 

I desperately want to stop all of it, coke, nicotine, alcohol and hash but I don‚Äôt know where to start. I don‚Äôt feel that I have any reason to stop, I function well, if not better (!) I can afford it all. I feel that I‚Äôm more positive and have more energy using but I‚Äôm aware of the harm it must be doing me and I hate being beholden to it all just because I don‚Äôt know what will happen if I try to stop. 
I should add that absolutely no one knows about this and everyone I know would be totally shocked. I live in a small village where everyone knows everyone. I‚Äôm well respected in my village largely because of the caring role and community work I do. I‚Äôm a single parent to my 23 year old son who lives with me who has mental health issues and needs a lot of support. I have kept this absolutely secret from everyone and no one else is involved or partakes with me. 

Questions:-
How do I even begin to come off all this?
Is it safe to just stop cocaine or should it be reduced gradually? 
What will withdrawal feel like? Is it painful?
How can I still have the energy to work and not feel absolutely shattered without the coke? 
Will I be able to do this on my own without anyone ever knowing?

BEST LOCATION HO CHI MINH VIETNAM TO LIVE FOR EXPAT,"Best location Ho Chi Minh Vietnam ‚Äì We‚Äôll walk you through some of the simple details of living in Vietnam that you need to take note such as culture and climates before we get into the nitty-gritty of the process of renting a property in Vietnam and how it works

Learn about where you‚Äôre going to live in Vietnam

Please join Best House to follow the following items:

The culture

Vietnamese as a common language, but the cultural differences among them can make these cities feel as if they were worlds apart.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to moving to a city and building a new life here, here are some major differences between the communities of these cities that you need to know.

The climate around Vietnam in general

Vietnam has a tropical climate which is dominated by the monsoon season.

The temperature in Vietnam typically ranges between 70¬∞F and 95¬∞F throughout the year. Average annual humidity is around 85%. Vietnam receives the majority of its precipitation during monsoon season, but the rest of the year also receives regular rainfall. The average annual rainfall is about 40 inches.

&amp;#x200B;

Vietnam has three distinct regional weather patterns. The far north of Vietnam is mountainous and its high altitudes can sometimes experience snow and freezing temperatures. In Northern Vietnam, winter (November to April) is cool and dry and summer (May to October) is hot, humid, and rainy (July to September has the highest rainfall).

Central Vietnam is hot and dry in the summer (January to August) and cool and rainy in winter, with monsoon-level rains in October and November.

Southern Vietnam has constant warm temperatures. Here the seasons are simple: rainy (May to November) and dry (November to May).

**Ho Chi Minh City ‚Äì Saigon**

Saigon screams vibrance and modernity. You‚Äôll find a great number of skyscrapers in all districts of the city, as well as long rows of rickety townhouses stacked alongside one another.

The people here are more open, dynamic, and welcoming. People don‚Äôt mind going out of their way to make you feel comfortable and accepted.

As sociable as they are, they avoid prying into the details of your personal life, and are among the more accepting communities in the country.

Expect cultural diversity and a bilingual population. Saigon is basically a land of immigrants, with different neighborhoods populated by people of different ethnicities, such as Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Caucasian Westerners.

**Choosing the place to live in Sai Gon**

Ho Chi Minh City (also known as Saigon) formerly known as Saigon before 1975 or Saigon-Gia Dinh is the largest city in Vietnam in terms of population and urbanization scale. It is also the economic, political, cultural and educational center of Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh City is a centrally run city belonging to a special urban type of Vietnam along with the capital Hanoi

**Binh Thanh District ‚Äì a stone‚Äôs throw away from District** 1

Those who want both proximity and affordability should move to B√¨nh Th·∫°nh District, which is adjacent to District 1 and only a 5 to 10-minute drive away. Featuring the largest number of apartment buildings in town, B√¨nh Th·∫°nh District gives you a wide range of apartments to choose from as well as more competitive prices.

Some of the most popular developments in the area include Vinhomes Central Park, Saigon Pearl, Sunwah Pearl, City Garden, and The Manor.

&amp;#x200B;

Advantages:

Economy ‚Äì trade has developed, so Binh Thanh district‚Äôs strengths are mainly developing industry, commerce, handicrafts, services and tourism.

Disadvantages:

With the population growth rate is too fast, the infrastructure has not kept up with the master plan to upgrade, the awareness of some people is poor in awareness and environmental protection, so Binh Thanh district is currently facing with the problem of environmental pollution

District 1 ‚Äì the heart of Saigon

The heart of Saigon, District 1, is where major tourist attractions, government agencies, and office buildings are located.

For this reason, this is also considered the most expensive place to live in the city.

[M4F/FB] Incest Prompts - Be my little Femboy Bro or my little Sis,"I'm 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+

Hey people on the Internet. I'm looking for a longterm roleplay Partner. I have a couple of Prompts you can choose from. We can also discuss different ones, if you have another idea.

1. You're my little Brother and i'm watching over you for a couple of months, since our parents gone overseas for work. We always had a Bond that was a little bit too close. We would cuddle on the Couch, hug each other and sometimes sleep in one bed. You're Body is not masculine at all, more feminine. With the right dress, somebody would mistake you for a girl. In this Story, we both sit on the couch, drinking a little bit and start talking about Relationships. That we want intimicy just like ours, but we won't have a chance of finding someone like this outside of our home. So we agree to try a relationship. You as my ""Girlfriend""(Feminization included). When our secret relationship survives, we plan to move in together and start our own Family (with a kind of drug that makes it possible for you to get pregnant).


2. You're my little Sister and we live together in a small apartement. We are roommates and both in college. I come home and caught you making pics for your onlyfans website. I blackmail you to do all the kinky stuff i want. If not, i would tell our Parents and all Relatives what you do. You hate it of course, being the Fuckbuddy of your Brother, but you don't a choice. You don't want to be cut off from the Family.
So i can force you to suck my dick in the morning, fuck you in the dorm (no contraception) and throatfuck you while we are in a changing room, getting new clothes for you.


Any Prompt can be changed in some way. You can rp as a female, male or Cuntboy.

Alternative: If you're a Sissy/Femboy, we can also just chat about how i would use you as a fucktoy. I'm dominant so i can take the lead.

My Kinks:
Incest, impregnation, mpreg, rough Sex, Romantic, throatfucking, dirty talk, degradation, blackmail, public sex, feminization, sissy, forced

My Limits: Gore, Vore, Bathroomstuff

My Kik: RPME2021

My Timezone is GMT+2, but i always sleep like 5 hours or so. The rest of the day, i have time to write. Reallife comes first, but when i'm gone for at least a couple hours, i tell you beforehand.",KikRoleplay,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/KikRoleplay/comments/pc06wt/m4ffb_incest_prompts_be_my_little_femboy_bro_or/,Dom Male Seeking Any,Serialkiller9047,pc06wt,/r/KikRoleplay/comments/pc06wt/m4ffb_incest_prompts_be_my_little_femboy_bro_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/KikRoleplay/comments/pc06wt/m4ffb_incest_prompts_be_my_little_femboy_bro_or/,0,2021-08-26

I think our autobody shop is imcompetent,"My husband and I are not rich by any means, so we are the type of people that drive our cars until they really can't drive anymore, which is why four years ago we had to finally buy a newer car because my husbands car (that he had since high school) finally died. So in 2017, he bought a 2013 Ford Taurus. Good dependable car....or so we thought. Three days after we bought it, the water pump went out. $1,300. You better believe I made the dealership pay some of it because that was bull. But it's a car and those things happen from time to time. My husband isn't much of a car guy, he prefers to take it somewhere and we like to support smaller businesses so we were lucky that there was a shop that had popped up in our area about a year prior. We take his car to this shop for EVERYTHING: tires, oil changes, brakes, etc. There was only one time we had to take it to have an oil change elsewhere because that shop was booked out for almost a month.

Anyway, as time goes on I'm finding we are taking his car to the shop more and more. Now most of this is car maintenance sort of stuff, but what are the chances they are all going to happen in less than four years (he bought the car Oct 2017). We've replaced all the tires twice, brakes once, spark plugs and coil packs, wheel baring (SP?), and I know there is a bunch more but I don't know much about car talk. Those I didn't really complain about, but the water pump I did.

Like I said, first water pump went out within the first week. Because of the design of the car, they have to dismantle the entire front end to fix it. It's in the shop for 3-5 days and at that time being a one car family was incredibly difficult with me working days, husband working nights and us having kids. The SECOND water pump went out about 2 years ago. I was pissed. Apparently we were 1,000 miles over the warrenty and they basically said ""sorry but it is what it is"". We just don't have that kind of money sitting around but needed to fix it so we had to put it on a credit card (that we are still paying on!). At the end of the week, they call  and say the car is done. My husband was off that entire week so it wasn't a big deal, we picked it up and parked it at home. Two nights later we are driving to the store when gasoline starts spewing everywhere. It was night time so we park the car and try to call a tow truck. Both tow companies in the area were ""too busy"" to come (ironically the county fair was in town that week and you could hear it in the background of both company's oncall drivers when they said call the other competator company). After okaying with the business that we could leave the car overnight, we went home. The next day we had it towed to that shop and left them a not very nice message. *Apparently* when they rebuilt the front end after replacing the water pump, *someone* forgot to reattach the fuel line. So, that was fun. The guy said ""it may have just fallen off"" and only offered a free oil change as a way of compensation. Fine. Whatever. But this gets better.

A MONTH AGO my husband said his car was acting up. Granted we have dropped his car off at the shop (including oil changes) probably 8 or 9 times already this year. He drops it off and they look at it. He comes home to tell me THE WATER PUMP IS GOING OUT. Yep. 24 months after we replaced water pump #2, they say we need to replace it again. I lost my marbles about it. I demanded we get back in the car and go down there but he told me to chill because the guy was going to pull some strings for us. The guy did help buy talking to his supplier and standing up for us trying to get them to help pay for the cost because even he said this was getting ridiculous. It took three weeks for them to finally agree. So while he is able to convince them to pay a portion of the cost, it still costs me $400, though. That was last week. It was the week my husband was planning on being home (county fair time, sound familiar?). They surprisingly got it done in a day (I was shocked) so we drove it home and it was parked the rest of the week and the weekend. 

My husband goes to work Monday night, no issues. Last night (Tuesday) he leaves for work but doesn't say anything. A few hours later I finish my work (I work from home still) and leave to go to the grocery store. As soon as I open my garage I see there is antifreeze all over the garage floor where he parks his car. Fuming, I called him at work to ask about it and he had no idea, he didn't see it when he backed out because he was in a hurry. He then went out and checked and his antifreeze was practically empty. So now his car is leaking antifreeze. Again. Which is how we knew the water pump was going out in the first place.

Again, I understand car's can have issues but my car, which is 15 years old and I've had it for 10 years, hasn't had these issues (2007 Ford Edge). Besides oil changes, we've taken my car to the shop once this year for additional work. It cost me $200 and I haven't had issues since. Honestly, since January and not including oil changes, we've probably spent nearly $3,000 on car repairs FOR HIS CAR ONLY. If there wasn't such a price gouge on used cars right now we would have traded it in months ago. My plan is to wait out the market for the prices to come down and then get rid of this money pit. I called the shop first thing this morning and the guy seemed irritated when I told him. He better be irritated with his crew because I definitely am. Now I was being nice on the phone because I prefer to blow up in person that way they can't hang up on me, but my husband was adamant that throughout all those previous problems, I was absolutely not allowed to have a temper tantrum with the shop. He knew the guy (they're on a frickin' first name basis now!) and we live in a small town so we *know* about his now ex wife that cheated, blah blah blah. But last night when I talked to my husband on the phone, he finally gave me the okay to go down to the shop and cause a scene. I always let my husband deal with them because I wasn't allowed to because he was afraid I would say something mean and they wouldn't want us back as customers. I could care less about that now, we can't keep giving this shop our money every single month. 

So if you see a video on TikTok or YouTube of a ""Karen"" going crazy at an auto repair shop, that will probably be me. But this will be a justified Karen incident.",venting,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/pc0fz8/i_think_our_autobody_shop_is_imcompetent/,,rachelc00,pc0fz8,/r/venting/comments/pc0fz8/i_think_our_autobody_shop_is_imcompetent/,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/pc0fz8/i_think_our_autobody_shop_is_imcompetent/,0,2021-08-26

Bosses are basically refusing training to multiple employees and I'm at a loss,"I don't know if this post is for this subreddit, but I have no idea where else to post about this.

Long story short, I and two other colleagues were assigned to handle the company's emails. And it's nowhere near as simple as talking to customers; there's specific workflows to follow and documentation to handle (at least a dozen different types of emails, which one must know how to work with). We had to be trained on how to do it all, but we never were. Management simply gave us a channel in the chat software we use for internal comms. At the beginning of all this I sent an email, requesting training and notifying management of the previous training, which was never finished. The result was that I got silently taken off the project (at least for the time being).

Fast forward to today (previous paragraph happened at the beginning of this month) - for the past week I have temporarily been assigned as a substitute Team Lead to my department until the actual Team Lead comes back from their leave on Monday. So, me and the Team Manager had to ask those two colleagues several times to handle the emails, because they piled up. I cannot express how gross I feel about having to do this, even though I'm in the same boat as them. That's besides the point, though.

Since I work from home, I used the chat software to coordinate everything. This way I received a text answer a few times, which said they have no idea what to do. By now I thought my colleagues had been instructed, because they work from the office; those answers suggest otherwise.

To me this means that management is basically throwing us in the deep, expecting us to swim, even though we don't know how. And they're basically refusing to train us, saying the channel is enough. This also goes contrary to a meeting I had with them, where they basically said I was in the wrong for not communicating this with them on time (to a point they're right, but that's a story for a different post) - it led me to believe that if I had said something about the training earlier, it would have happened.

My question is, how would you guys handle such a situation? Would you just find a better job or try to talk to management? I'm at a loss and I don't know what to do at this point. Besides maybe talking to the owner of the company directly, but I don't know how much that would help.",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcacn1/bosses_are_basically_refusing_training_to/,,ExpStealer,pcacn1,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcacn1/bosses_are_basically_refusing_training_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcacn1/bosses_are_basically_refusing_training_to/,0,2021-08-26
AITA for not going to help the disabled elderly man I've been helping for the past few years?,"I (19F) have been helping out this disabled elderly man around his apartment for a few years, since I was 16.   


Backstory: Throughout the 3, almost four years I have helped out this man, I've bent myself backwards in different ways. I went from housekeeping to becoming a personal care assistant. Like when he needed to go to the hospital, I was the one to care for him, even at the cost of my first meeting with my father in a years. There were so many things (and sometimes he didn't even pay me), I can't even think of them anymore, but they were things that really should've been taken care of by a professional. My mom had to call him to tell him that her high schooler daughter shouldn't have to deal with some of the stuff he put on me. But he's really ill, has no family he trusts or friends, and so I kept going back to help him. 

I've started college now, and despite telling him I wouldn't come over anymore, have come again in the past month because he couldn't find a replacement. But now that I'm attending classes, and they just so happen to be remote and overseas, I am operating on a schedule that is 12 hours ahead than where I am. I do not have a lot of time to do other things.

The only reason I am still in the US is because classes are remote. But I gave him so much time to prepare. I told him when college started I probably won't have the time to see him. I told him years ago, and I made sure to let him know as time started ticking where I'd be attending college.

I never thought I was the one who should be helping the way I am, especially when it became more demanding. 

So now I'm at my current situation. There was a month I didn't see him, and I came back because I figured I'd help him find someone else. But he's picky. He doesn't want to go to an agency and get an home health aide, he doesn't want anyone over a certain age, so on... I don't think he has the luxury of being picky, and then being entitled to my time.  And I say entitled because now, and before, if there was a reason I couldn't come he'd go on about everything he's done for me, how sick he is, and how he needs my help.

I kept reiterating I needed at least two weeks of my current schedule to see if I could visit, and it took him a bit to actually listen, so yesterday, he said okay two weeks, but now he is saying ""make it less than two weeks."" I told him I didn't appreciate how he acted as if he was entitled to my time and he called me bitchy lol.  


I care about him, but I'm not a home health aide and I'm a college student now. I've given him so much time to prepare for my departure, so I don't think ITA, but I do feel a little bad about him.

28 [M4M] Buddies into free/casually using my wife when they need to get off?,"This is one of my favourite fantasies/ideas and wondering how many other people like it. Essentially it's simple fantasy of my buddies freely using my wife whenever they want/need. Maybe it's an agreement we all made that when we got girls we'd be good buddies and share. Or maybe I'm just the sharing is caring type and so is my wife! Either way this has been going on long enough that it's all just casual/normal between all of us.

No one blinked an eye when on our wedding night we were joined by my good buddies. Or when my wife and I wake up to one you using her to help relieve your morning wood before heading to work. Or when you need to destress after work stop on by for a quickie. Or come on over, we'll stroke on the couch watching porn until my wife gets home and she helps both off. Or when we all go out together to a bar taking turns taking her to the bathroom or the alleyway. When we‚Äôre at the alter for our wedding while shes giving her vows you‚Äôre underneath her dress and when she‚Äôs saying I do you‚Äôre balls deep in her. More ideas welcome of course! haha

"11. 'Seven Years, His Richer'.","11. 'Seven Years, His Richer'.

Andrei Spelling was not exactly lost, but for some unknown reason, he found himself standing in front of a large Hotel, 'The Derp'.
His bearance on time seemed no different, but the first thing he needed to do, was find some proper footwear.

He entered into the hotel where the Christmas Store should have been, when he found out his smartphone was no longer working (something he unrolled his pant bottoms for, most thoroughly).

The Bellhop came to help him, but Andrei was already sure enough in his own mind, that his recent experiences meant he must have been through some form of outright time travel. He'd read books like that before. He needed to get inside.

Avoiding the Bellhop, he made it past him, and then took pleasure in wiping his, now sockless, feet off on a mat.

Looking for a Calendar, it placed him 7 years into the future.

Cripes...

He walked the circuit of the hotel, and found a series of underground tunnels. He deemed it safer to explore indoors than outdoors, and decided to walk within for a while, going over things.

Ultimately, he found himself facing a new pair of boots in a footwear store and spending all his Christmas money on those, as well as a little bit, which he had left over, on food from a food court.

He had been in an adjacent mall, which hadn't changed much, but for the shops, before leaving it, to try for home.

Evelyn was extremely shocked to see him at the door. She had been reluctant to open it.
She had to explain to him that in light of his 7 years absence, it had really done him the far in the betterment.

Over one third of the population, is cyborged, she explained, and the rest are vegetable. She looked tired. I try to stay at home, she said. I hadn't really known what to expect since you'd been gone.

Andrei sat down and related everything that had happened to him, and Evelyn quickly rationalized with him, that nowadays, in short of people selling their souls for an era of eucharisma, the light of everything she had hoped for had passed with his father.

He was about to hear, that they were in some sort of fairytale parallel, or something, and though she never thought it could've happened to her in her 45 (now near 55), years of living, she was 5 years widowed, and people who didn't seem believable, despite being fallen from grace or not, were not in, ""hope.""

Jeremy had moved out, into a condo, not too long ago, with his girlfriend. They had moved just south of the city, to Deladun.

Evelyn now had birds, as well as Minx, to keep her company.

---

The next day Andrei made a trip to the extremely-seniored Ralph Dizzmith's Estate, to see what he could do to repair things.

I have here, said Ralph, the Book that they took it from:

---

‚ÄúTwas, The Night Before Christmas‚Äô, And, ‚ÄòComplementary Viewpoints to the Story‚Äô‚Äô.
Story by, ‚ÄòClement Clarke Moore‚Äô.
Commentary by, ‚ÄúVeronica Smudge.‚Äù

---

‚Äù‚Ä¶ Twas the Night Before Christmas,
When all thro‚Äô the house.
Not a creature was stirring,
Not even a mouse‚Ä¶‚Äú

‚ÄòThere was Peace in the House'.
It is unlikely that there is any grand significance in the, ""mouse,"" so this is by no means a, 'Mice and Men‚Äô, Analogy. If it was, ‚Äúdead,"" in the house, this is only intended to be taken figuratively, as silence.

""Stirring,"" can mean, ‚Äúglaring,‚Äú and implies that no creature was looking (i.e. everyone was sleeping).

The Russian version of, ‚ÄúSanta Claus,‚Äù is, ‚ÄúFather Frost‚Äù/‚ÄúDed Moroz.‚Äù Phonetically sounding like, ‚ÄúDead Morose,‚Äù he‚Äôs dressed in the colour, ‚Äúblue,"" but not literally grave. This detail is only included, because it's factually interesting, not, because it's relevant to the commentary in any way.

---

‚Äú‚Ä¶ The stockings were hung
By the chimney with care,
In hope‚Äôs that St. Nicholas
Soon would be there‚Ä¶‚Äù

'Goods &amp; Brimstones'.
In the winter, stocking were hung by the chimney to dry. However, ‚Äúdry stocks,‚Äù also meant, ‚Äúdry goods.‚Äù If stockings were to be filled with goods, that would imply that someone had also been, ‚Äúgood.‚Äù

Though, if someone had reaped no good in their walk, then coal was used, truly making it, the, ‚Äúbrimstone.‚Äù

---

‚Äú‚Ä¶ The children were nestled
All snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar plums
Danced in their heads‚Ä¶‚Äù

'Birds, Fiddles, and Zwetschge?'
In the Kriol Language, where the word, ‚Äúbed,‚Äù can also mean, ‚Äúbird,"" the words, ‚Äúnestle,‚Äù and, ‚Äúsnug,‚Äù serve aptly to create the idea of comfort, by filling it in with accordant terms.

However, ""bed,"" cannot be substituted with, ""bird,"" in the verse. This leaves us with the thought that there must be something other in it, as well, that is, ""Kriol,"" in the mention.
‚ÄúNestle,‚Äù as a German verb, can mean, ‚ÄúFumble,"" but here, means, ‚ÄúFiddle.‚Äù

Beginning to use some of these clues, to solve the tale, or how anyone could even consider a, ""Dancing Plum,"" first we take the word, ""Fiddle,"" and ask if there is any reason why it shouldn't be an abstraction on the term, suggesting the musical instrument, ""The Fiddle.""

If, ‚ÄúKriol Plums,"" are known as, ‚ÄúSpondias Mombin‚Äù/‚ÄúHog Plums‚Äù, the musical instrument, ‚ÄúHog Fiddle,"" could be the instrument we were seeking.

This is, because they are also known as, Appalachian/Alleghany/Mountain, ""Dulcimers.""
The reason why we focus on Alleghany/Mountain, ""Dulcimers,"" and no other, is, because, ‚ÄúDulcimer,‚Äú breaks down into, ‚ÄúDulce‚Äù &amp; ‚ÄúMelos,"" both, which are traits of a certain type of plum.

Explanation:
""Dulcimer""/""Dulce"" &amp; ""Melos,"" tie into plums, in the usage of terms, because,
‚Ä¢ ""Dulce,"" means, ‚ÄúSweet,""
and,
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúMelos,"" means, ‚ÄúSoft""/""Mellow.""
* Similar to the Plum, ""Zwetschge""/""Zwetsche,"" sounds like, ""Sweet,"" and is Mellow.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ In many parts of Germany, no distinction is made between the...
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúZwetschge‚Äù/‚ÄúZwetsche‚Äù - Oval, Mellow (‚ÄúDamson‚Äù),
and,
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúPflaume‚Äù - Round, Crisp (‚ÄúPlum‚Äù)‚Ä¶‚Äú

An Example?
Adult Speaker 1. ‚ÄúWe can get, ‚ÄúZwetschge,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúPlums.‚Äù
Adult Speaker 2. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt they really the same thing?‚Äù
Youth Speaker 3. ‚ÄúSweets &amp; Plums are the same thing?‚Äù
* Hence, ‚ÄúSugar Plums,‚Äù born.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ And mama in her kerchief,
And I in my cap,
Had just settled down
For a long winter‚Äôs nap‚Ä¶‚Äù

'Phanon, Fahne, and Vane'/'Faddle'.
If the Mama has a, ‚ÄúKerchief (French translation being, ‚ÄúCouvrechief,‚Äù meaning, ‚ÄúHead-Covering""),"" we must consider how the author (Moore), being Protestant, would have been familiar with the type of, ""Kerchief,"" used in the Catholic Church.

This, ""Kerchief,"" known as a, ‚ÄúPhanon,‚Äù is used in Church Ceremonies (not worn on the head).
The alternative word, ‚ÄúFanon,‚Äù is referred to as a, ‚ÄúFahne (German).""

It refers to a, ‚ÄúFlag,‚Äù but can indicate one‚Äôs level of alcohol consumption, when called a, ""Vane.""

In this case, it is used to refer to a, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Noticeable smell of alcohol on one‚Äôs breath‚Ä¶‚Äú
A, ""Vane,"" would make a, ‚ÄúFaddle (a, ""Trifle,"" or waste of one‚Äôs time),"" and add a complementary word to the aforementioned word, ""Fiddle."" This implies that Moore was going by some, ""Idealogical Format,"" in his writing, and we might be correct in having followed it, thus far, in our assumptions.

Making another assumption, if we have a, ‚ÄúFiddle,‚Äù and we have a, ‚ÄúFaddle,‚Äù then we have a... ‚ÄúFuddle.‚Äù

'Fuddle &amp; Fuddlecap'.

The word, ""Fuddle,"" means, ‚ÄúIntoxication.‚Äù Coincidentally, the word, ""Fuddlecap,"" refers to, ‚ÄúSomeone who drinks alcoholic beverages too frequently.‚Äù

- Hence, Papa's, ‚ÄúCap.‚Äù

'Sympathetic Symbolisms &amp; Hibernation'.
Had, ‚ÄúJust Settled Down,"" is probably not intended to imply marriage, as they already have children, so they have likely been married for some time, already.

That being said, ‚ÄúSettled Down,‚Äù here, is probably a plot-device being used by the author. One known as, ‚ÄúPathetic Fallacy.‚Äù

They just settled their, ‚ÄúDown‚Äù/‚ÄúBedding,‚Äù and (like, ‚ÄúFrau Holle's,"" fairy-tale), so too, was snow outside, having been settled.

The, ‚ÄúLong Winter‚Äôs Nap (i.e. ‚ÄúHibernation""),"" implies that they are now, ‚ÄúPut Out,‚Äú hence the correlation between bed's down and snowfall outside.

It could also suggest that the family just ate.

---

‚Äú‚Ä¶ When out on the lawn
There arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed
To see what the matter‚Ä¶‚Äù

'Gossip &amp; Papa's Abrupt Awakening'.
Seeing as how the, ‚ÄúLawn,‚Äù is a form of, ‚ÄúLand,‚Äù and its, ""Snow,"" is the ‚ÄúDown,‚Äù of Mama and Papa's, ""Blanket,"" from this Literary example of, ""Pathetic Fallacy,"" we can assume that the, ""Lawn,"" is just a reference to the, ""Bed,"" the two were sleeping on.

Once, ‚ÄúPeaceful,‚Äù we would assume, ‚ÄúThere Arose Such a Clatter,‚Äù to mean, that the noise came from outside.

Moore, though, was more than likely, referring to, ""Gossip (‚ÄúClatfart""),"" arising from within the house, and more specifically, on the bed of the two, as the word, ""Gossip,"" stems from the words for a, ""Close Friend or Relation (i.e. A Confidant/His Wife).""

The, ""Papa,‚Äù sprang up from his bed, because he had been awoken from it, directly.

---

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Away to the window
I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters,
And threw up the sash‚Ä¶‚Äù

'Hurling'.
Simply, ""Away to Papa's airhole, blew his stomach's contents, like a blaze, awakening in the process, as he threw up what he had chased.""

The verse, ‚ÄúTore Open the Shutters,‚Äù referring to Papa's, ‚ÄúOpening of Shut Eye,"" while he sat up, instantly, in bed in reaction to his wife arising, and consequently, ‚ÄúThrowing up the Sash (""Sash,"" meaning, ‚ÄúChased"")."" The French word used here, being, ‚ÄúChass√©.""

---

‚Äú‚Ä¶ The moon on the breast
Of the new fallen snow,
Gave the luster of mid-day
To objects below‚Ä¶‚Äù

'Moonshine &amp; No Hangover'.

Having breached the topic of the, ""Appalachians,‚Äú once before, in, ""Appalachian Dulcimer,"" I feel it important to now address the nature of the alcohol.

The alcohol, being, ""Moonshine,‚Äù landed on the breast of the blanket.

‚ÄúMid-day,‚Äù is noon. ‚ÄúLuster,‚Äù is shine. The, ‚ÄúObjects,‚Äù below, thus, have no shadow. We can reason, that the Papa is now fully out of whatever hangover he might have had, both he and Mama, now being, ""object,"" to him vomiting.

---

‚Äú‚Ä¶ When, what to my wondering
Eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh,
And eight tiny reindeer‚Ä¶‚Äù

'Whiskey (Miniatures') Slider'.
In Dutch, a, ‚ÄúSlee (Sleigh),"" is also a type of, ‚ÄúMeteor,"" known as a, ‚ÄúBolide,‚Äú or, ""Fireball."" The, ""Bolide,"" is of the type known as, ‚ÄúMeteor Procession.‚Äù

* ‚ÄúFireball,‚Äù is a type of, ‚ÄúWhiskey.‚Äù
The, ‚ÄúMeteor Procession,‚Äù indicates, a, ‚ÄúPint of Whiskey,‚Äù consisting of eight, ‚ÄúWhiskey Miniatures.‚Äù Hence, making the entire, ‚ÄúPint,‚Äù a, ‚ÄúMiniature', ‚ÄúSlee.‚Äù

In this case, the, ‚ÄúSlee,‚Äù would be the, ‚ÄúGlass,‚Äù as, ‚ÄúSlaegr (in Ukrainian),‚Äù means, ‚Äú(The) Slider.‚Äù
If the, ‚ÄúEight Tiny Reindeer,‚Äù are of the, ‚ÄúMiniature,‚Äù they were likely eight, ‚ÄúDalmore Whiskey Miniatures,‚Äù with deer on them.
* Note: ‚ÄúSugar Plums,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúMoonshine,‚Äù are 17th and 18th Century.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ With a little old driver,
So lively and quick,
I knew in a moment
It must be St. Nick‚Ä¶""

'How Well Papa Manages Alcohol'.
If there is a, ‚ÄúLittle Old Driver,‚Äù maybe we should look for a, ‚ÄúCamel,‚Äù in the Whiskey references out there.

I did, and yes, it's there.
‚ÄúCamel,‚Äù is a type of, ‚ÄúWhiskey,‚Äù and also, means, ‚ÄúWean.‚Äù

A, ‚ÄúCamel Driver,‚Äù is known better as a, ‚ÄúDirector, Handler, or Carer.‚Äù The Papa, being the handler (and one to wean himself) of his own, ""Whiskey,"" probably saw his mess as a, ""proverbial St. Nick's,"" doing. One (might I add), who was no good for him.

---

‚Äú‚Ä¶ More rapid than eagles
His courses they came,
And he whistled and shouted
And call‚Äôd them by name‚Ä¶‚Äù

'Papa Starts to Disbelieve in Drink'.
‚ÄúRapid,‚Äù in England, means, ‚ÄúViolent,"" while, ‚ÄúEagle‚Äôs,‚Äù root word in Middle English is, ‚ÄúEarn,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúCorser,‚Äù in French, means, ‚ÄúSpice up,‚Äù ‚ÄúIncrease,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúWorsen.‚Äù

This tells us that Papa's drinks (‚ÄúIncreasers‚Äù), became more, ‚ÄúViolent,‚Äù than, ‚ÄúEarn (i.e. They were really trying him and he couldn't afford it),"" so, he whistled, assessing his own situation with disbelief, and shouted at them, calling them out, by the vices he saw in them.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Now! Dasher, now! Dancer,
Now! Prancer and Vixen,
On! Comet, on! Cupid,
On! Dunder and Blixem‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄòTheir Names, Thor's Goats, and a Rooster'.
‚ÄòDasher‚Äô - ‚ÄúDestructive.‚Äù
‚ÄòDancer‚Äô - ‚ÄúUnconservative.‚Äù
‚ÄòPrancer‚Äô- ‚ÄúProud.‚Äù
‚ÄòVixen‚Äô - ‚ÄúWicked.‚Äù

‚ÄòBlitzen‚Äô/‚ÄòBlixen‚Äô - ‚ÄúFast""/""Impetuous.‚Äù

* Note: ‚ÄúThe, ‚ÄúEight Names,‚Äù are meant, rather, to correspond with, the, ‚ÄúEight Directions,‚Äù or meant as, ‚ÄúWinds,‚Äù as may be found on the standard, ""Weather Vane.‚Äù

* Though, initially there were only two goats, as reindeer much later on toward the evolution of the, ‚ÄúSanta Claus,‚Äù mythos. Those two goats, pulled Thor‚Äôs sleigh.

Why mention a, ‚ÄúWeather Vane?‚Äù Well, for what is often found on top... A, ‚ÄúRooster.‚Äù

* Note: If, ‚ÄúVane,‚Äù ties into, ‚ÄúAlcohol.‚Äù ‚ÄúRooster Whiskey Cocktail (i.e. ‚ÄòWild Turkey 101‚Äô),‚Äú Indicates, that the, ‚ÄúEight Names,‚Äù are Papa‚Äôs, ‚Äú101,‚Äù of a, ‚ÄúBourbon.‚Äú

‚ÄúBourbon,‚Äù is of, ‚ÄòBorvo‚Äô, a, ‚ÄúCeltic God of Hot Springs.‚Äù

The root words of, ‚ÄúBorvo,‚Äù mean, ‚ÄúHot,‚Äù ‚ÄúBoil,‚Äù ‚ÄúFroth,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúFoam,‚Äù like, ‚ÄúBhrewh.‚Äù

---

To the top of the porch!
To the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away!
Dash away all!‚Äù

'Papa's Fed Up'.

The, ‚ÄúTop of the Porch‚Äù/‚ÄúPortico,‚Äù is a, ‚ÄúRoof,‚Äù whereas the, ‚ÄúTop of the Wall,‚Äù is a, ‚ÄúCeiling.‚Äù
Maybe where we're looking, then, is the, ‚ÄúAttic?""

An, ‚ÄúAttic,‚Äú is also known as a, ‚ÄúFa√ßade,‚Äù And the word, ‚ÄúFacade,‚Äù also means, ‚ÄúGuise,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúAppearance.‚Äù He is telling the drinks off to their, ‚ÄúFace,‚Äù while shouting, ‚ÄúAway All!‚Äù

---

As leaves that before
The wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle,
Mount to the sky;

'Dregs, Eyewall, and Sky'.
To say it in another way:
As drink remnants, or, ""Dregs,"" before the, ""Bourbon/Bhrewh,"" fly, being swirled around the inner edges at a glass' bottom, when they meet with the sides (like in the, ""Eyewall,"" of a, ""Hurricane""), Slee/Glass to the, ‚ÄúSky"" ... ""Sky,"" is when you, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ Drink with Nothing Touching your Mouth or Lips...‚Äù

This is the very description of how he drank it, having met with the obstacle of having his drink remnants in front of him, after telling them off.

---

So up to the housetop
The coursers they flew
With the sleigh full of toys,
And St. Nicholas too‚Äî

'Nonsense'.
The, ‚ÄúDrinks,‚Äù flew to the, ‚ÄúRoof,‚Äù as Papa drank once again. So too, did the, ‚ÄúWhiskey Glass,‚Äù ‚ÄúT√∏ys (another word for, ""Nonsense""),‚Äù and, ‚ÄúSt. Nick.‚Äù

This implies, that the Papa, drinking the remainder, had just had it in with his concerns, and let it be.

---

And then, in a twinkling,
I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing
Of each little hoof.

'Broodroof'.
In a, ‚ÄúVery Short Period of Time (‚Äúa Twinkling‚Äù),‚Äú the Papa may have, ‚ÄúHeard-On,‚Äù ‚Äúthe Roof.""

A, ‚ÄúBroodroof,‚Äù is a, ‚ÄúDenial of Fair Right to Gain Employment.‚Äù Mama, here reminded Papa, that if he couldn't earn enough money in, he should give up drinking.

Papa heard, ‚ÄúPrancing,‚Äù and Pawing of each little, ‚ÄúHoof,‚Äù which can be interpreted as, ‚ÄúDancing Feet,‚Äù of, ‚ÄúHufƒÖ,"" or, ‚ÄúDancing House,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúEstate.‚Äù This suggests that the drinks were dancing his House, ""away."" He remembered good times being had in his house (and likely imagined others), but the drinks were once again taking him by his betterment, or advantage.

---

As I drew in my head,
And was turning around,
Down the chimney
St. Nicholas came with a bound.
'Humbug'.

As Papa drank the Whiskey in, he turned around, putting down his, ""Chimney,"" Highball (Glass). The proverbial, ""St. Nicholas,"" came with a ‚ÄúBombito""/""Buzz (an old word for the, ‚ÄúDrinking of an Entire Bottle‚Äù).‚Äú

* Papa's Whiskey, had run out.

---

He was dressed all in fur,
From his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished
With ashes and soot;

'Papa's Appearance'.
‚ÄúFur,"" can mean, ""Thief""/""Robber,"" so Papa was more-than-probably, dressed in his, ""Nightrobe""/""Nightgown (which seemed like considerable plunder, but of what?).""

* His clothes too (not only his night-clothes), may have been dirty, from having been smoking.

---

A bundle of toys
He had flung on his back,
And he looked like a pedler
Just opening his pack.

'The Blanket'.
Papa had a, ""Bundle (a term, conveniently indicating, ""... Sleeping with Someone, on the Same Bed, ""Dressed""/""Without Undressing""...""),"" of, ""Toys""/""Nonsense,"" Flung over his Back.

* This is the Blanket (""Plunder""), which he had just Spewed Upon.

He had dragged it off the bed, and was removing it from himself (as the word, ""pack,"" can refer to a, ""wet,"" or, ""dry,"" sheet, ""packed,"" around a person), and looked, more-or-less, like a pedler/beggar, for this reason.

---

His eyes‚Äîhow they twinkled!
his dimples, how merry!
His cheeks were like roses
his nose like a cherry!

'Shining Eyes, and Rosy Complexion'.
The Papa's Eyes Twinkled, and he had a Rosy Complexion.

It could be, that his eyes were tearing from being mildly upset, or that he was embarassed. His Skin Colour, was also Rosy, from Drink.

---

His droll little mouth
Was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard on his chin
Was as white as the snow;

'Smiling, and Papa's Beard'.
The Papa was still smiling, however flustered, and his beard was white, like the, ""snow,"" or, ""blanket,"" had been. We assume that he made relatively little mess of himself, and found something in it to smile about, despite having just, ""ruined,"" the blanket.

---

The stump of a pipe
He held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke, it encircled
His head like a wreath;

'Papa Smoking his Pipe'.
The Papa had picked up his, ""Tobacco Pipe,"" and lit it, while smoke rose up in the room, and began to encircle his head, around.

---

He had a broad face
And a little round belly
That shook when he laughed,
Like a bowl full of jelly.

'Papa's General Figure'.
This segment refers to the Papa's, somewhat, ""portly,"" figure. He had begun laughing and his stomach was shaking a little bit, for him being in this situation.

---

He was chubby and plump,
A right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him,
In spite of myself;

'Mama's Observation'.
It is here, that we can see that the verses describing the, ""Papa,"" are from the, ""Mama's,"" ""Objective Point of View."" Papa looked very chubby and, ""elfin."" So much so, that it even caused Mama to laugh, despite how she normally might have kept it in.

---

A wink of his eye,
And a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know,
I had nothing to dread;
'Papa Assuring Mama'.

Papa winks at Mama, letting her know, in his own way, that there was nothing to worry about. He turns back to his liquor cabinet, and she ceases to worry about him.

---

He spoke not a word,
But went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings;
Then turned with a jerk,

'Papa Replenishes his Alcohol Stock'.
Papa replenishes his Alcohol Stock, as we thought it had run out, then turns again.

---

And laying his finger
Aside of his nose,
And giving a nod,
Up the chimney he rose

'Something Rose'.
He puts his finger aside of his nose and nods, filling up his, ""Chimney,"" Highball, with something, ""Rose,"" ""Purplish-Red,"" or, ""Pink.""

---

He sprang to his sleigh,
To his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle.

'Papa's Renewal to his Team'.
The Papa, springing to his glass, gives another whistle (this time, of relief and considerable joy). He had found enough left in his stock of drink, and away everything flew, like the, ""Downing (i.e. ""Drinking""),"" of something, ""Plumose (""Thistledown,"" is the, ""... Typically Plumose Pappus from the ripe flower head of a Thistle..."").""

---

But I heard him exclaim,
Ere he drove out of sight‚Äî
‚ÄúHappy Christmas to all,
And to all a good night!‚Äù

'Sleigh, Dray, and Heavily Intoxicated'.
The Papa, ""Drives,"" his Alcohol, because a, ""Dray,"" is a cart for, ""Barrels of Draft,"" that was commonly driven at the time, but furthermore, ""Out of Sight,"" means, ""Heavily Intoxicated.""
Even still, he wishes everyone in his house a, ""Happy Christmas,"" and, ""Good Night.""

---

* 'Revisiting the, ‚ÄúStockings‚Äù'.
There is a display shelf on Papa‚Äôs wall, near the, ‚ÄúChimney,"" Highball. It is hung on his wall and the stocking was the Papa‚Äôs stock of liquor.
The concept being alluded to in this Story, is that Papa has been waiting for St. Nicholas to get him... ‚ÄúPlum drunk,‚Äù and, as he has entirely finished the Whiskey, he is grateful to find some leftover (Rose-coloured) brandy, in his liquor stock/shelf/cabinet, as he really enjoys his drink. It is, ""Plum Variety.""

---

'Plum Drunk'.
‚ÄòSlivovitz‚Äô, is a (Fruit) Brandy.
The children, may not have been dreaming about a brandy Papa had brought in, for he and his wife, though they may have overheard it, in a reference to, ‚ÄúDamson Sweet,‚Äù from whence, they may also have, derived the concept of, ‚ÄúSugar Plums.‚Äù

---

* Papa, was most certainly drinking this one, lastly, as it ties the story together and leaves him, once again, to his, ""Fuddlecap,"" or being, ""Heavily Intoxicated,"" as he is found to be, ""Out of Sight.""

---

* Note: I made the personal assumption that the Papa was had up with the Whiskey, and starting to disbelieve in his drinking, rather than calling them on any further, once he had lost his hangover and had his memory jogged to them once again, because he seems to have been shouting, of their vice, exacerbatedly.
Perhaps, he was only eager to get back to it, because it was a Holiday.

'Out of Sight'.
https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/stay+out+of+sight
* 'Santa's Book of Knowledge', by, 'Santa Al Horton' (PG. 7).

---

So, as for Veronica, the rightful Native Author, who owns this veritable, literary, ""undoing,"" of the Holiday circuit, if ever I wished to get back into my Christmas Gear, again (with what it says, right here)... I can't.

Santas are either Charitable, Fake, Saintly, or Demonically Made... and Ms. Smudge calls out Christmas as a Covetous Cover, Based off Alcoholism and Heresy, that's only good for Alms.

I can't get back into a Holiday that lends no credence to it's Prime Belief. Not to mention the fact that Wells and I had it out. The whole holiday, is a, ""mock-array of polluted.""

But I'll tell you what it did Andrei. I took those books seriously for once, and after 3 years in therapy, I can say I'm a different man.

How's your wife? Adelaide?

Oh, she's up and left me, replied Ralph, wearily.
She's living out with Sasha in Cape Idaro, now.

---

'Stew'.

There was a Big Raffle going on in Evelyn's Church.

Andrei was there, in his new costume as the Easter Bunny, and was prompted to put eggs all around the Cathedral and in the Park.

He had also, just begun with his Volunteering. Seven years without employment, he knew, could never look as good on a resume, as one updated with more recent credentials.

It was Hallowe'en.

Do you know what I found out recently, Mrs. Somerset, asked Andrei. Really it's the very thing, which prompted this whole Easter themed Hallowe'en Party, at the Church, by the way.

What's that? Andrei asked her, interested, as she was stirring a big pot of stew. He put it up to guesswork that it was either something to do with the realm of the excellent Church matron Rebecca was, or her cooking.

Well, firstly, you weren't in it for the money. So, we're extremely happy to have you over here Volunteering with us. There was this old scenario, as you might have guessed, she went on to explain. Where rabbits were used in stew.

Oh, so is that what you're cooking Andrei asked, wrinkling his nose in a way that suggested he wasn't very happy with the idea.

No, it isn't, don't worry, said Mrs. Somerset, laughing. But back when people cooked them, they were often prepared in a type of, ""Ragout,"" called, ""Civet.""

""Civet,"" said Andrei puzzled. You mean, like the wildcat?

Not like the wildcat, she replied calmly, though the stew has the same name as it. You see, the root word of, ""Civet Ragout,"" is, ""Cive,"" or, ""Chive."" And in Spanish, ""Chives,"" are called, ""Chivar,"" with the English meaning of, ""Egg,"" as in, ""Squeal,"" ""Rat,"" or, ""Tattle."" This created a direct correlation from the Bunny at Easter Time, to the Very Popular Egg. Eggs, which are saved at Lent during the time of fasting, and Painted, because it can be hard-boiled, and last without spoiling, to be eaten after.

Cool, said Andrei, I didn't know that.

You see, if a child was good, they might have participated either in the, ""Ragout,"" or getting to, ""Rag Out,"" or, ""Dress Up,"" depending on how sensitive they were to violence.

Those who chose not to hunt, may have opted for playing games, and looking for sweets. Those, however who deserved not the Seasonal Festivities, were reminded to read their Scripture, and this is how the Lutheran Easter Bunny who judges the Good and Bad Children, at Easter or Lent became a figure.

Mrs. Somerset, then said something odd. Those messages you had written at the Christmas Store all that time ago are still very valuable and some of them, are even still in the Church circuit. Take a break, and socialize with some of the others for awhile, won't you? You don't need to wear that Rabbit Costume, right now. Maybe get back into your Church Clothes. We know Hallowe'en is rough out there. I'll save some of this stew especially for you and your mom to take home! She then smiled at him. She really was a wonderful Lady.

So Rick Bush and Rodney were trying to figure out how to get out of the identity theft and the treason charges,"Like I said there is no way that they're going to get out of it rick Bush was trying to maintain her become like an electric and stay like what I was on it that and trying to get me a diagonal person that was never going to happen because I had to be who I was and what I was no matter what so Rick Bush really was never going to have it the way you wanted to have and I hate him I guess there's one person that have removed from existence it would be worth Bush he was trying to remove me because he knows that I have to go back to the White House and have to be what I am except he wants to be what I was or what I am supposed to be so like I said he thought he could pull a fast one when it was never going to work so he was very upset and very angry I have a little trick with nervine to be successful


Like I say no one was okay with it I was very bad no matter what so


Feel like I said I really do enjoy disappointing Rick Bush 



Like if there's one person that I just enjoy disappointing we enjoy having things not to his way and probably Rick Bosch enjoyable to have him fail and understand how powerless he really is


I mostly I'm going to be really happy when I know like I said no one ever cute actually pretend like he was praising worsening like no harassing me 



Frank Bush even thought that if he poked through the world and had Family Lines then Yoshi was Lucifer it then it's like now. They would never pick him anyway and there's no like that was that's never going to happen it's not possible you can never be there in the first place


So in some ways it was enjoyable I try so hard he tried nothing was ever going to be successful cuz I was a paradox at the end of it life and existence was going to put him through such punishment


Can you resend punished reminder pain extreme pain so he tried to punish me and hurt me first like I say everything is going to be undone 



That's basically what a paradox is that's the beauty part of a paradox it's something that can't happen that won't happen except even if it does happen it won't happen for very long


Yup the the fun thing about a paradox first requested nearby paradoxes or understand them



And everybody hates them like you don't see me trying to make everyone hate me but I'm not him 11 posture he's actually telling people that I was like Lucifer The Imposter Samantha thinking no I'm not the in the fake Lusphur 


And I still have my hair so like I say you should have given up a long time ago I left the meeting with her. Just matter what you do you don't have a choice


Do not even Catholic church or anyone was ever going to help rick Bush at everything you try and everything you'd done everything it said everyone hated him


Kid forced his way upon everyone and anyone and everything every religion every people everywhere


I want the Paradox failed the deep-seated hatred they said he was trying to make that deep-seated hatred into the hatred for elusive her that's like no they were never going to hate me like that I don't be like that I don't feel like that inside I agree. You can take the feeling from the side of me beside me now you really can't do that yes I do all this psycho weird s*** it's like you know some people just don't get it any kind of understanding or clue you know they don't understand that the more they fight the more they blah blah the more people hate them the more people lose any regard for any kind of sympathy 



And I mean also like my feeling when I say that Rick Bush did not deserve to exist that was like his coffin now I was the one person you know play so that's one of the reasons why he be saying is Brian Brian and the deceiver and I even said that Lusphur did not have a right to exist like I was a bad person I'm even tried to say that he created me


I mean he would later on try and say that he was joking I mean like I say silence in space and time did you know that space and time could actually go silent everything could actually stop for a second in shock a great Bush saying that like they weren't like belief or whatever they were angry no one would ever know one had ever dare say that about me



Like I say Rick Bush and many different times did I understand the level of which he was doing things and how things were being affected and how like the things he was saying there is no turning back 



They would never believe that I was created by Rick buscher faith God or whatever like really 1944 versus me I mean Rick Bush would be scrambling to try and something rather like your tricks and deceptions don't really work I guess I A I don't care if you call what you can cause it you try and call it entertainment me and Steven time and space and existence would see that as an excuse or some way of trying to say hoes just because like everything was angry

Existence itself became angry at  Rick bush 


I mean I couldn't stop them I didn't have anything to do with it barely even knew that existence I've gotten angry Mikey doesn't understand the reason why I was loved and cared about I was innocent 

I mean every word only made everything worse for it bush he's never going to get away from it or out of it he wasn't even going to exist existence itself would refuse him

Henry like I said I don't know in 80 years he's going to stop existing or some other time when he died he cannot take my place he cannot be as I was


He's trying to use the government and then you got kicked out and they try to get Rodney I got kicked out


I said they've consumed in trying to find one way or another

Like I say even if whatever was whenever 

Because I wrecked my truck Bush said and did a paradox might how spontaneously appeared around 


I mean in space and time existence itself it's really hard to say certain things without knowing and what Rick Bush was trying to do and doing was so bad and so horrible that I mean nothing was on his side I just trying to be the father and teach ciphers how to do things they do not to do anything this thing that taking my memories like you know it's just a big nightmare nightmare that no one need to die like I said it was not fun for me it was not fundraising existence not even worse I might just walk away anyway that's so they can lose me no matter what they can't break Bush can't be rude like Rick Bush can't be anything you can't take over the government 

 I mean everything you wanted to do he can't own America he can't run the government he isn't Lucifer no one would ever mistake him for me it is like pretend like all the stuff could happen


He couldn't be lost in sin and all this other stuff like I mean they might lose everything because he can't do what I did he can't be me and I don't have to be me I'm sure about it trusting I have to be that person do those things I'm the only one who could have the cartel and the government and Mexico and all this stuff I'm the only one who can actually do that Rodney can do that with Bush couldn't do that no amount of time will ever change that they thought I would do it blah blah and then they would redo it right now they can never have that 


So you might like I said that's the whole point of the paradox they can never get there and I don't need to be there and they can't be that


I love how Rick Bush said that I was wrong and I didn't know if but I was young child and itsfunneh well we'll find out

I like Rick Bush trying to pretend like I'm Brian and like someone else that was never going to work no no never believe that I mean I have said everything he did was just so stupid like I don't know how you ever thought of workout I got you can't become Lusphur 


I mean instantly become Lord 


And that's why they were trying to kill off all the life-forms in the people's because of course they noticed no it was okay with it Ferguson you know many people including me wash their hands of life in existence brakebush and Rodney thought that would help with me gone that new gets home free for them it's like you don't come up on life and existence


So I can send everyone is after them no one is okay with it

So they were always been buried and I knew a long time ago Rick Bush was trying to kill me thinking that without me around so stupid play wild night I said everyone would notice what he was doing

So I said he was trying to get out of like you know the identity theft using a forbidden name treason like he's trying to find a way where it works out where it's not so bad when he found out that I was going to punish them no matter what cuz I knew about what you've done later on everything else in existence agreed with me 


How do you say he was trying to undo existence itself he didn't care honey honey so I'm trying to blame me for it

I said he didn't have a silver tongue that's very rude thing to say using my words silver


Irish Bush. That was he took over and all those words like took over and all this and that requesting understand the words that he was uttering or how have you taken in by everyone else around I said he'd be trying to pay people to harass other people or say bad things about other people because everybody would freaked out and was so angry at him like we're not talking about some guy harassing some girl because she has green hair

I mean kind of weird when you see 90% or 70% of existence you know I miss Lee realize things and understand things I never seen a lot of things that happened because of Rick Bush ever before in existence didn't even know they could happen


Rick bush was saying how I life was  going to remove Lusphur 


I mean I was probably the one who said well if they attacked me I could probably deal with everything in existence attacking me I am the most loved


I never thought about the usefulness of being the most loved in the most write the highest loyalty like that's an interesting way to use it that well when everything attacks maybe it won't be so bad I mean a lot of interesting things happened

And wow useful 


Like I said in many ways I just liked being helpful and efficient and effective and I cared a great deal about my lines of life and everything in existence I was just one of those people 


No I've never had sex or four store anyway. Ross for devotion or loyalty or anything by earned it though anyway feel like I say I never thought about the other side of usefulness for that kind of stuff like I mean it's interesting so like I said it was very funny because if I had been anyone else I would have been dead


Though I actually survived I think maybe even became more powerful I don't know

I never really cared about power or well the kind of relative things and kind of I'm too ancient to actually really have anything to do with that 


So like I say I think I've been in existence far too long as it is I know the request was never going to give up


Existence is going to be A  nightmare with him around so I don't think anyone's going to let him stay around

Like I say the thing is I don't go for that kind of worshiping praising I don't go for like kids were kind of on my side I have no idea I really don't know how he's doing how I is 

IS ELS 

There's a place where only I can be and I have to be there they want to work out a way where like I died has Brian Bradley and I and like I said I know everything that they're going to try and do they really can't do that 


There is no trick there is no scam there is no way that this was going to work out and Karen local news that I'm fussy I hold grudges I'm very angry I like I said a lot of other people have been praising the worship and had showings of loyalty and it's like really what are you going to do for me

How are you going to reach my level of 80 trillion year ancient and of course Rick Bush and Rodney are going to try and have that instead of me 


I'm the greatest in existence you think I can't just be forced or what ever 


I said calling me running very important years disrespect you know you don't like them I don't have to say I don't have to live I could even choose to die and go away by my chose 

No one has any power over me 

There will never be another one like me after I'm gone with the end of Lusphur Lusipher Lored Silver Lite Star Line

Mexico to the died and fought really hard for them to their land and they actually fought off American government I said I feel bad for the cartel they're good people

Like I said it was wrong in so many people think I'm just whatever or like I can you review this whatever side you everyone knew exactly what I wanted the whole time


And I knew that they've done something I know that they've done to me have said they also know that I would find whatever there is no getting anything by me


I said I really am not good I really am not effective efficient and that professional there's no one better than me

As Electric life-form I was like a vorpal nightmare that was Unstoppable and insanely and fishing and did things that no one even dreamed possible 

I was illumination and everything how is unkillable an impossible to stop or get too like I was the protector and they worked insanely hard to try and kill me like they don't ever want me to be an electric again because of how great and powerful and I loved and cared about I was cuz I'm innocent and pure I'm selfless through and through I think there's certain things about who I am that they are rules and laws in existence

I mean I'm 100% real and part of everything I work self-esteem everyone and everything to create existence and measurement and everything for the betterment of everyone and everything humans and flushes try to take the credit for everything that I did


I mean when you get right down to it. Still everything the truth is about the American government and America and the White House is that it's just one everything everyone else is just a smokescreen because I did so much


I mean everything like I don't know exactly how it worked or how it worked I was behind every thing 


Doesn't really matter then like I said what I did and what I was doing this for life and my name is I didn't really care about the credit 


I didn't think that they would take the credit for me and a lot of people were really shocked and upset about how they were claiming but I did my work


Like I said Rick Bush and running over people if they can't do what I did they can't become what I was mccuistion Ronnie thought that they can get other people to do it like now no one else can do what I do they're not me they don't feel the way I feel but I think about things that I do



Doesn't matter if I think if I say anything doesn't really matter if I don't say what is true is true and actual and real and words and saying things in meaning or pretending to do stuff acting I mean they cannot undo what I did and they cannot redo what I did no one else can be that person


You removed me from everything and there is no America there is no one else have fun actually and kind  of like sweet Lusphur Lite  vengeance

Rick Bush and Ronnie and some real people think that they can just take over and be like me like they can't really do that


And by now basically I'm not going to waste my time like I don't need to go back to the White House or be whatever but I'm the only one who can actually be in the house that's fine because they want to be there so badly and I don't really care 800 trillion years ancient version I don't need this to be they can't have it though

I'm not going to go back and yet they have no validity treasonous hostile takeover I'm angry there's no way to satisfy her make me happy Rick Bush and Rodney thought they could just have fun and whatever I'm really found out they're like no one was okay with that 


And then they thought they could just kill me or remove me or Erase Me 


I mean after everything that I've been through

You don't come to me at the last minute Diane there's nothing I couldn't have anyway hello I enjoy talk to Rick Bush around me we'll see how bad it gets


Maybe you mean you're not saying they needed needed to Superior they needed well it would never work anyway

They should have never tempted to try and now that I'm angry I'm never going to accept request anywhere in existence ever and he thinks he can be more than like no I don't need to be in these but I don't care how many existing patient I have to be in your system brakebush is a problem I said I left it up to existence and exist 



I mean I was cool I tolerated men I even like some people like Harrison Ford and my Patrick Stewart and certain Men actually like I think they're cool I'll give you some of the Hell's Angels I like them or don't mind them being in existence even though like I'm the one that I'm going to mail them all women are supposed to worship and praise I'd like to kind of like a weird kind of thing because it's like especially the way that's the way I am by the reasons why I was like well maybe I should just leave and go away because like I mean the way I am the way things are for me right absolute the kind of absolute that rick bush  and Rodney and other people want to have that they can never have 


Like the thing is even if Rick Bush and Rodney had absolute loyalty I mean what would they do with it like what two guys from 1940 I wouldn't like what go get some beer and a pack of cigarettes megumin do the house what I mean last night ancient or even if not anything that you would have absolutely loved before I am that one person 


So I mean you know they want to be me is like what you're a dude like winning a praise and worship you didn't create females you don't get a symbol of planet Your Existence doesn't involve the moon and Apollo where the women going to worship you didn't own Germany you don't have a real symbol where did is being annoying to the girls try and tell some jokes what's the worshipper love some bald-headed piece of s*** that use a forbidden name and had his hair genetically removed by Electric inventor I did it after they had taken over America like I'd like to see them explain how I did that


I have always really surprised about the Harry move like that was real I'd like to see people explain it they'll never be able to explain it how did I do it how do I do it. Never know you'll never understand I love that because it's like you know you'll never understand like that's something that only I could do cuz I'm not real person I said Rick Bush and Rodney and other people they thought that I was just moving some kid with his name Lucifer recite it was never just my name and technically I was probably Brian Briley at that point in time

I said do they can never remove my name like I said in laws and government and rules and everything at stone stone is my name imaginary change Ike is against everything because everyone knew that Rodney Rick Bush were trying to take my name and Rick Bush and Rodney thought that would figure out the names like now it was never your name they're not protected it's not their real name they took that name my name is never change for trillions of years


My name never changed and like I said I would have it verified by everything in existence exoskeletons electrics it's like if there's any doubt that I'm not that electric Lucifer unique person that invented sulfur and genetics and whatever like I would want to know as well I refuse to take a name from that little perfect person and if there's any possibility at all I mean. Like I say I have purpose I'm that kind of person my feelings are different I speak sometimes differently like I mean there's a lot of things about me that aren't normal


And my name Briley of course Brian Arian


Err ere era air are 


It's actually ELL err

There's something about the dictionary I was ELL something and then they changed it or saying that

Err 

So then I redid the definition somewhere else


ELL 

Like Rick Bush and runny nose people are always constantly trying to come after my name like I owned LOE LOME LOOM 

L/_\/_\M I forget exactly how it was it's real though I mean I was never really on the ground like that and so I feel like I really was an electric not a biological so different 


So when someone else is trying to take over Caesar  or whatever I changed it too rome

Only because my L always stays with me

I'm L 

And so like LUSA and with no Lusphur USA

An avp prompt focused on the Aliens,"Im looking for a non con alien from AVP roleplay where an alien goes around raping earths women and no help ever comes making it more hopeless
Id like my partner to play the women and i play the men and alien


Wheres my wife!: A mother and wife is being raped by the alien from the ceiling as just below them her frantic husband looks for her

Lazy employees!: At a petrol station a women is working with her manager when suddenly she disappears and gets raped by the alien

The Oogie Boogie man!: A daughter tells her dad that theres a monster under the bed, her dad doesnt believe her and she gets raped when he leaves, how ever if the mom is the one to look under the bed shell suddenly be face fucked by the alien and the daughter is none the wiser until she eventually gets raped

Hip hip hooray!: after their team wins a game the small group of cheerleaders go to their locker room to clean up and celebrate. Little do they know theres a sneaky alien inside that goes around stealthily raping them all one by one.

Date night: A womens date is waiting outside her bathroom door when the alien comes in through the window and rapes her while shes showering. Her date none the wiser

Whoops wrong place!: a female burglar breaks into a house where the alien is raping the familys women. She plays hide n seek with the alien for a bit before almost escaping then she gets caught at just the last second, getting dragged into the darkness of the house and viciously raped.

Uh oh wrong way: a hitch hiker is walking down a long road near where the aliens ship crashes and soon they find themselves with each other....she gets raped

Possible 261: Someone calls the police about finding a woman with her holes gaped open and full of cum. They sent a police woman to investigate and shes led to an abandoned warehouse where... Shes raped by the alien 

Im wanting the scenes to be hopeless and suspenseful so the women trying to escape begging and resisting like making it to a saviour a friend who just gets raped later, their home or anything thatd save them or trying to fight back all pluses they can either stay resilient or they can accept their fate your choice

Should I quit?,"For some context. I'm currently studying in an university abroad in a mobility program and my experience after a month has been quite bad to be completely honest with you. For starters, due to the pandemic I'm following the classes online - which means I have to stay up until 4 am, and we're starting to get some group assignments and I don't know anyone, and with exception of one teacher no one has given a fuck for me (this semester I study subjects from three different majors -food, chemical and electrical engineering- and two interdisciplinary...). When I ask about something I don't understand about the uni or classes, I have the feeling that the people that are meant to help me are bothered, or I'm left simply without answer. And to sum it all up, it's in a language that I don't 100% understand.

And what bothers me the most is that I've been working quite hard all these years and I rely on scholarships for studying. If I were to fail, I'm doomed. I could still continue studying, but it would be a overwhelming effort for me and my family.

Does anyone has gone through something similar? Is it worth trying to make it work? The classes in my home country haven't started yet, that's why I've been thinking for a while sending an email (that I might have it already written...) to the international office of my university asking if I could drop the exchange and join the classes in my home uni.

I'd be very thankful if you could suggest me different approaches or perspectives to handle this situation the best way possible. I'm just blocked and stressed with this situation and need some feedback.",CollegeRant,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbp48v/should_i_quit/,,Zhawr,pbp48v,/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbp48v/should_i_quit/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/pbp48v/should_i_quit/,2,2021-08-26
"This week was supposed to be the start of so many amazing things, but it's all gone to shit and I can't seem to get over it.","TLDR; I'm a mess, life is fucking me in the asshole with no lube, no end of misery in sight.

I  struggle with so many mental health issues, cptsd, codependency,  bipolar, depression, anxiety, etc. and for the last couple months my  ADHD has been especially difficult. I knew a long time in advance that  this week was going to be the start of many important things, mainly  revolved around grad school (I moved from Cleveland, Ohio to a suburb of  Philly PA for grad school last year during the pandemic and a lot of  terrible things happened which ended up in me withdrawing for the  semester and going into an inpatient psych facility for a week).

So  not only was I going to be back in grad school (THANKFULLY on campus/in  person because the online stuff was what made me lose my mind), but I'm  starting an important internship that's part of my graduate program and  I'm still working a job, I just went from full time to part time. I  knew juggling all these things were going to be really hard so I started  planning as much as I possibly could. Meal Prepping healthy foods.  Going to the gym to create a rhythm of working out. Getting a dotted  notebook to do bullet journaling. Checking my school email to see when I  would get my syllabi's for classes to help with planning. I finally  felt like things were going in the right direction and I was finally  starting to get a handle on my life.

And  then, on Monday night I was the victim of a hit and run accident. Now  luckily I didn't get physically hurt from this, which that I am thankful  for. But emotionally I feel broken. I have insurance and part of my  policy is getting a rental car for when my car is getting repaired, BUT  my car is a little bit older (2011). When I was telling the claims  adjuster on the phone the details of the damage she told me that there  is a chance my car will be deemed a total loss which means that I will  have to get a new car. This shook me to my core.

My  finances aren't great, but I've made some good progress in the last  couple of years and since I started on a specific recovery path things  have really turned around for me. My credit score is not great tho. And I  still have a very good chunk to pay off for the car. Also I just  reduced my hours to part time instead of full time, and I just genuinely  cannot afford another car right now. I was banking on still paying off  this car for the next couple years and getting a new one after I get out  of grad school.

Basically, since  the accident I have been an absolute wreck. No pun intended. The  accident happened at 7:30 on Monday night. I was starting my very  important internship on Tuesday at 8:30am. I was not able to get a  rental car Monday night, but I could get one when the rental place  opened at 7:30am. I had to get a lyft home from where the accident  happened because I didn't feel comfortable driving the car in the  condition it was in. When I finally got home around 10pm I was trying to  figure out how to get to the rental car place at 7:30am, when I looked  up booking another lyft for it it would have been $25, (I had already  spent $15 on the lyft home from the accident) and I couldn't afford  that. I still had to save enough money for the deductible and other  costs this whole thing would accrue. So I figured I could just go  through public transit - granted I had never taken it before since  living in Philly and had no idea where to go. I woke up at 5am on  Tuesday to eat breakfast, take a shower, get ready for the internship  and have enough time to get to the bus stop on time. And to no one's  surprise, I miscalculated the timing and knew I would not get to the  rental place early enough to get to my internship on time, so I called a  lyft. Another $15 gone. The rental place was not expecting me to come  so they only had 1 car for me which was $10 more than my insurance  covered. They told me if I returned it before they close at 6pm I could  avoid the charge.

I made it to the  internship on time - even early, which was my preference. Internship  went fine, but during my lunch I returned a call to the place where my  car was towed to, and they told me I needed to authorize them to work on  my car before they could do anything with it. Couldn't sign the  authorization form on my cell phone, so I would have to go after I got  done with the internship before they closed at 5:30 pm. Also, I forgot a  phone charger and my battery was depleting quickly. I am not familiar  with how to get into and out of the city of Philly and needed my phone  for gps but that eats a lot of battery very quickly and of course when I  left my internship at 4:30pm I hit a ton of traffic on my way home. I  did not know where the place my car was towed to was, and when trying to  go to it on my own without a gps I fucked up where I was going and was  terrified I was not going to make it by 5:30pm. I ended up arriving at  5:27pm and I was so panicked the lady at the counter told me to take a  few deep breaths to calm down. Then there was getting to the rental  place before they closed in time, and again, facing traffic on my way. I  was so mad at myself and so frustrated. I was screaming and yelling at  myself in the car for being so dumb and going the wrong way. I ended up  getting to the rental place at 6:03pm but they were still open thank god  and I got switched to another car my insurance fully covered. By this  time I had a massive migraine and felt miserable. Called my mom to try  and talk about how miserable I was, she told me that I needed to not  think about my car stuff and to just focus on school and internship  because that's more important. But I literally can not.

Then  came today. I went to work, things were normal but I had 2  appointments, one with my Psych NP to get my adderall adjusted, and one  with a therapist I'm not even sure I like yet. Thankfully I really like  my Psych NP and she was the first person to validate all of my  frustration about this whole situation. She told me it's okay if I take  an extra of one of my anti-depressants and is upping my adderall which I  desperately needed. For the first time I was starting to feel better  until I met with my therapist. I explained what I was feeling and why  and all of that but that I was starting to feel better. Then she started  to poke and prod why I felt so bad about everything. Asked me about my  childhood and my parents and why I feel like I'm inherently bad and bad  things happen to me disproportionately, all of this while my phone is  low on battery. To no shock and surprise I forgot my phone charger -  again. Luckily a coworker had a charger she let me use. My therapist  asked me about the abuse my mom did when I was really young and what my  dad did, and she was asking me more and more about stuff with my dad.  The LAST thing I wanted to do was talk about my stuff with my dad or  even think about stuff with my dad. I have a lot of issues with my  codependency in relation to having a very absent and emotionally  unavailable father. I basically asked her if we could end the session  because I had 1% battery left on my phone and I just didn't want to talk  about stuff with my dad. It's left a really horrible taste in my mouth  about this therapist and I already wasn't a big fan of her.

All  I wanted to do was go to my school library and get started on my  homework. I was so excited to get home and get all my stuff together and  go to the library to finally get started in school mode because I  literally CANNOT work from home do homework at home like my brain cannot  manage doing stuff like that at home. I need to be in a physically  different location in order to focus and get stuff done. But of course,  my school ID would not let me in any building. The library said if my  card isn't working they can't let me in. I went to Campus Security and  asked me if I had been vaccinated and updated my info with the school  which I absolutely have done. I told them I have my first class tomorrow  morning at 9 am and how was I supposed to get into the building. They  said lots of students are having this problem. I have been waiting OVER A  YEAR TO ATTEND THIS UNIVERSITY ON CAMPUS AND IN PERSON. I CHANGED MY  ENTIRE LIFE FOR THIS - AND MY FUCKING ID CARD WON'T LET ME IN CAMPUS  BUILDINGS FOR NO GOOD REASON.

I am  destroyed, defeated, and done. I have no one I feel like I can turn to.  I don't feel safe or validated by like anyone. I don't even want my  cats around me I'm so miserable but of course they want to be near me  because they know how miserable I am. I just need someone to give a  shit. I've been sober for over a year and it's days like today I just  want to say fuck it and drink or smoke something.",CPTSD,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/pbq1uo/this_week_was_supposed_to_be_the_start_of_so_many/,CPTSD Vent / Rant,GoddessScully,pbq1uo,/r/CPTSD/comments/pbq1uo/this_week_was_supposed_to_be_the_start_of_so_many/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/pbq1uo/this_week_was_supposed_to_be_the_start_of_so_many/,2,2021-08-26
AITA for getting my colleague fired,"Hear me out, this may look like a straightforward case but I have my reasons for doing what I did. 

I know a friend from college, we studied CS together and went our separate ways. We had some fights then but still knew each other. I was a much better student that he was and he was also ways busy with something going on at his home. I got better grades and got a better first job. However, due to some personal reasons, I could not keep up with the demands at the company I joined and so I left and joined a smaller company. My friend did well in the FAANG company he joined and I was happy for him. Now that my personal situation is resolved (my kids are now in school) I felt I could take on the demands of work again at a large company and so I reached out to him. 

He was busy so I may have mentioned that I always missed him just in order to get him to pay some attention to me. It worked and he gave me glowing referrals to him manager and I got hired in his team. This was about a year ago. Despite us working together he used to hit on me sometimes and I politely used to tell him no. I used to flirt with him when I needed some help in my work but it was pretty low key. I don't think anyone of us thought it was anything other than silliness. He knew I had a lot going on at home and so was happy to help.

I recently found out that there was an opportunity for promotion in the team and talked to my manager about it. Turns out both him and I were the contenders; It was a high stress job but came with a pay raise. He has much more credibility in the team since he was lucky enough to be there for over 6 years and I was sure he would get the promotion. I am having a rough financial time so I had to figure out how to get that promotion. All is fair in love and war you know. So we had an offsite last week and he was flirting with me lightly in front of my colleagues and I reported him to HR. 

It looks like HR talked to a few people and got mixed answers but just to be safe, they are terminating his employment. I feel bad for harming him this way but I couldn't think of another way to get him out of the way. Some of the friends at work no longer hang out with me and are calling me name. 

I can understand that it wasn't the best outcome for him but I had to do this for my family. I think I may be the Asshole because he is in trouble because of me.",AmItheAsshole,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbo672/aita_for_getting_my_colleague_fired/,,cajibag715,pbo672,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbo672/aita_for_getting_my_colleague_fired/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbo672/aita_for_getting_my_colleague_fired/,85,2021-08-26
Were you abused at Pioneer School?, Pioneer Special School Program. The absolute worst school i've ever been inside of. I attended Pioneer Special School program for 4 years for all of my middle school years and freshman year and I have seen how they treat their students first hand IT IS DISGUSTING! These children are sent to pioneer for what the staff call ‚Äúbehavioral issues‚Äù 99% of the time these ‚Äúbehavioural issues‚Äô are stemmed from the abuse they receive at school EVERYDAY and many of these children suffer from abuse at home and many of them are  on the spectrum. Many of these children leave their abusive households to come to school to be Literally BEATEN by the teachers and coaches when a student misbehaves in pioneer they will be sent to a room in the building called ‚ÄúDe escalation room‚Äù in this room the students are treated as prisoners in a 3rd world country they are forced in chairs by multiple adault men kicked elbowed and thrown into chairs and held down on the ground the students are left with bruises and scratches all over their body I witnessed a 7th grade girl being thrown into a chair and watched the staff repeatedly and knee the girl and punch the girls arm while her arm was on the metal armrest bar attached to the chair she was spit on by a coach with a light brown stubble and blondish hair. She had bruises all over her body. There is a Special Ed room in the school which is truly where the school shows its true colors. These troubled  children are abused all day in pioneer they will be sent to the de escalation room for the littlest of issues such as blurting out an answer or talking with another student. My class was across from the special ed room so i can hear these kids on the spectrum screaming and crying while being held down with way more then excessive force you dont need 3 staff on a special ed middle schooler they were holding this childs face to the ground and screaming at him meanwhile this child has no clue whats going on or why hes in trouble and the staff call it a restraint.  The staff in this school deserve jail time and this school should be investigate. PLEASE investigate this school their are even reviews off pioneer on google maps from multiple parents saying they have multiple bruises on their kids.,askportland,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/pc8dro/were_you_abused_at_pioneer_school/,Looking For,surenocuh,pc8dro,/r/askportland/comments/pc8dro/were_you_abused_at_pioneer_school/,https://www.reddit.com/r/askportland/comments/pc8dro/were_you_abused_at_pioneer_school/,0,2021-08-26
Friends and Family: A New Beginning (Chapter 22) Part 2,"The next morning, Jim woke up to find Sydney was not in the bed.  He looked at the clock radio.  It said 6:45 in the morning.  Jim wondered where Sydney was.  He got himself dressed and he made his way downstairs.  He saw Chelsea in the living room.  Jim asked her, ‚ÄúChelsea, do you have classes today?‚Äù

 Chelsea answered, ‚ÄúNo, Dad.  But I do have to work today.‚Äù

 Then, Jim happened to remember.  Friday.  Chelsea did not have classes on Fridays.  Chelsea did have to work today from noon until four at the nearby Walgreen‚Äôs.  Jim asked her, ‚ÄúChelsea, do you still want to go to Faulkner Motors with me after you finish work?‚Äù

 Chelsea said, ‚ÄúYes, Dad.  I do.  You still plan to look at that car Papa Walter wanted you to look at?‚Äù

 Jim answered, ‚ÄúYes, I do.‚Äù

 Chelsea said she was about to go upstairs and tell her sisters to get up and get ready for school.  Meanwhile, Jim made his way into the kitchen.  He saw Sydney taking a skillet out of one of the cabinets.  She was still wearing that oversized T-shirt she wore last night.  Jim asked, ‚ÄúSydney, what are you about to do?‚Äù

 Sydney answered, ‚ÄúI think I will make us breakfast.‚Äù

 Jim asked Sydney, ‚ÄúAnd just what are you planning on making?‚Äù

 Sydney walked to where Jim was standing.  She stood in front of him, putting her two legs together.  She smiled and gazed her eyes at him.  She finally said, ‚ÄúJim, I think I will make us some eggs and bacon, some toast, and some grits.  Does that sound like a good breakfast?‚Äù

 Jim let out a little laugh, gave her a kiss, and then he said, ‚ÄúSydney, I think that‚Äôll be great.  It‚Äôs about time my girls had a decent breakfast.  They do eat too much sugary cereal, anyway.‚Äù

 Sydney turned and walked toward the stove.  Chelsea walked down the stairs, and she said, ‚ÄúDad, I heard the last of that.  I don‚Äôt eat that sugary cereal.  You know that.‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, Chelsea.  I know that.  You eat bagels with cream cheese.‚Äù

 Then Sydney said, ‚ÄúYes, Chelsea.  Yesterday, while I was at the store, I got you some bagels.  But I also got you a different kind of cream cheese.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSure, Sydney.  What is it?‚Äù Chelsea asked.

 Sydney answered, ‚ÄúGarden vegetable.  I thought you might like it.‚Äù

 Chelsea said, ‚ÄúThank you, Sydney.  I don‚Äôt think I ever had it before.‚Äù

 On a radio in the kitchen, a radio was playing some classic rock.  Steely Dan.  *Do it Again*.  Jim went to the bottom of the stairs.  He shouted, ‚ÄúGirls!  I hope you are all up and getting dressed!‚Äù

 Lauren said, ‚ÄúI am, but Valerie is taking her time in the bathroom.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúThen tell her to step it up,‚Äù Jim said.

 Lindsay made her way downstairs.  She said, ‚ÄúDad, good luck with that.  You know how Valerie can be in the bathroom.  She‚Äôs so sluggish in the mornings.‚Äù

 Caitlyn soon showed up.  Jim asked her, ‚ÄúCaitlyn, how did you sleep during that bad storm last night?‚Äù

 ‚ÄúDad, I slept like a baby.  That storm didn‚Äôt scare me one bit.‚Äù

 Jim smiled and said, ‚ÄúOkay, you girls head to the kitchen.  Sydney‚Äôs starting breakfast.‚Äù

 Jim started to make his way upstairs.  He made it about halfway up the stairs when he saw Lauren and Valerie start their way downstairs.  Lauren was wearing a dress.  But Valerie, being Valerie, was wearing her usual thing.  A sweatshirt (with what appeared to be a T-shirt underneath), scuffed up tennis shoes and a pair of jeans with holes in the knees.  Jim would say something about that.  But this time, he didn‚Äôt.  But he did say, ‚ÄúI hope you girls are in the mood for a decent breakfast this morning, because that is what Sydney‚Äôs fixing.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúIt sure smells good,‚Äù Lauren said.

 Jim said, ‚ÄúIt does.  You girls be sure and tell Sydney that.‚Äù

 Four of the girls did say that to Sydney.  Valerie didn‚Äôt.  She did try to get a bowl out of the cabinet.  Valerie attempted to make her a bowl of Fruity Pebbles.  But Jim stopped her.  He said to her, ‚ÄúFreeze it right there, Valerie.‚Äù

 Valerie gave Jim a rather murderous look.  He said, ‚ÄúValerie, it just so happens Sydney is fixing eggs, bacon, toast and grits for breakfast.  You can eat that just like your sisters.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúDad, do I have to?‚Äù Valerie asked Jim.

 ‚ÄúYes, Valerie.  You do.‚Äù

 Jim took the box of Fruity Pebbles from Valerie.  She finally agreed to have a decent breakfast with the others.  Chelsea did agree to eat eggs and bacon, but instead of toast, she opted for a bagel with garden vegetable cream cheese.  They all spent about fifteen minutes eating their breakfast.  There were no complaints, even from Valerie. 

 After they got done, Jim got all the girls (except Chelsea) to finish getting ready for school.  Ashley and Toni showed up.  They both offered to take Jim‚Äôs girls to school.  Ashley was going to drive her son, Dakota, to school.  Dakota was now attending Radcliffe Middle School with Lindsay.  Ashley said she would be happy to drive Lindsay to school this morning.  Toni was on her way to her new job at a medical office near Carolinas Medical Center, where she was now working as an assistant for a pediatrician.  She started that job on Monday of that week.  Toni said, ‚ÄúJim, I go right by Dilworth Elementary, so I will be glad to drive Valerie and Caitlyn to school if it‚Äôs okay with you.‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúSure, Toni.  That‚Äôll be great.‚Äù

 Ashley and Toni saw Sydney in the kitchen, washing the dishes.  They said hello to her.  Then Jim asked her, ‚ÄúSydney, why don‚Äôt you put those dishes in the dishwasher?‚Äù

 Sydney answered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind, Jim.  Really.  Besides, they‚Äôre not that many.  After I get done, I‚Äôll be getting ready for work.‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúOkay, Sydney.  Svetlana will be here any minute.  Just put the dishes in the drain board, and Svetlana will put them away.‚Äù

 Sydney said she would.  Lauren was almost ready to leave for school.  Jim asked her how she was getting to school.  She said, ‚ÄúDonnie Courtland agreed to drive me and Christie to school.  He should be here any minute.‚Äù

 Jim said to Lauren, ‚ÄúIt sure is nice you have some friends who can drive you to school, especially where you are now, with you in your final year of high school.‚Äù

 Lauren said, ‚ÄúYes, Dad.  You know it‚Äôs nice to have friends, period.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúYes, Lauren.  That is true as well.‚Äù

 Jim, Sydney, Ashley and Toni all smiled when Lauren said that.  They had to remember one special moment.  That moment in the summer of 1984.  That moment at that house in Lansing, North Carolina, in the mountains in the far northwestern corner of the state.  That was when Jim and his friends made that special promise, the one to stay friends, no matter what.  So far, they never broke it, even though two of those friends were no longer with them.  Candi Faulkner and Todd McClendon.  Toni and Jeremy were not with them at the time because it was a church youth ensemble trip and they had just been born, but they would make that promise with those friends in later years.  Over the years as more friends arrived, they were included in that special promise.  Years later, the kids of those friends made a similar promise.  Just like Jim and his friends, the kids have not broken that promise, either. 

 Lauren got a look out the window.  She saw Donnie Courtland pull into the driveway in his car, a red 1973 Chevy station wagon with wood grain trim.  Christie, his sister, was riding shotgun.  Lauren grabbed her book bag, and she said, ‚ÄúDad, I must go.  Donnie and Christie are here.‚Äù

 Jim walked with Lauren to the front porch.  He gave Donnie and Christie a wave.  They waved back.  Ashley and Toni rushed past Jim, with his three youngest girls with them.  After they said their good-byes to Jim, they were all off to school.  Donnie‚Äôs station wagon was the last car to leave the Faulkner house.  After Donnie left, Svetlana showed up in her little Oldsmobile.  She parked in her usual spot, at the curb in front of the house. 

 Sydney had finished putting away the dishes when Jim and Svetlana stepped into the kitchen.  Sydney said, ‚ÄúHi, Svetlana.  Jim, I am about to finish getting ready for work.‚Äù

 Jim had gone up the stairs when he said to Svetlana, ‚ÄúOkay, Svetlana.  There is a good possibility that I‚Äôll be late coming this evening, along with Chelsea.  But my other girls should be home on time this afternoon.‚Äù

 Svetlana said, ‚ÄúSure thing, Jim.  What‚Äôs going on with you and Chelsea?‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúThere is a possibility I may be buying a car from Dad today.  Chelsea may also be buying a car from Dad as well.‚Äù

 Svetlana let out a smile, and she said, ‚ÄúJim, that‚Äôll be great.  What car will you be getting?‚Äù        

 Jim answered, ‚ÄúIf I can get it, it‚Äôll be a silver 2004 Cadillac Escalade.‚Äù

 Jim showed Svetlana a picture of it on his cell phone.  Svetlana said, ‚ÄúJim, that is one nice car.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúThanks, Svetlana.  Dad said he can get me a good deal on it if I‚Äôm interested.‚Äù

 Then Svetlana asked Jim, ‚ÄúWhat kind of car will Chelsea be getting?‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúThere are two cars she has her eye on.  One is a Chrysler convertible, and the other is a Camaro with T-tops.‚Äù

 Svetlana asked, ‚ÄúWhich one will she get?‚Äù

 Jim answered, ‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt decided.  But I hope she gets something she wants, and something she‚Äôll be happy with.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSo do I, Jim.  I wouldn‚Äôt mind getting another car, but right now, I‚Äôm stuck with what I‚Äôve got.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúGo see Dad at Faulkner Motors.  He can help you get a good deal on a car.‚Äù

 Jim knew that Svetlana‚Äôs Oldsmobile had been giving her problems.  He knew that, sooner or later, she would have to get another car.  In addition to her job as Jim‚Äôs housekeeper, Svetlana also worked Saturdays at the Sunbeam Bread Store, and twice a week at the nearby Home Depot.  Between her housekeeping job and her job at the bread store, Svetlana did not make a whole lot of money.  So, Svetlana would have to get a used car.  There was Faulkner Motors on South Mint Street.  If Svetlana made the decision to buy a used car there, there would be a good selection.

 Svetlana said she would go to Faulkner Motors if she needed to.  Jim grabbed his travel mug, filled it up with coffee (black with sugar, as he usually made his coffee), and he left for work.

üòä

 Jim had yet another good day at Queen City Chevrolet.  He managed to sell three automobiles before he left work at four o‚Äô clock.  Before he left work, he called Chelsea on her cell phone.  Jim said, ‚ÄúChelsea, I am about to leave work and I am headed in your direction.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSure, Dad.  I‚Äôll be here when you show up.‚Äù

 Jim left the dealership, and he drove to the Walgreen‚Äôs on South Boulevard where Chelsea was working.  Jim walked into the store.  He saw the manager.  The manager told Jim that Chelsea was in the back and would be out shortly.  Meanwhile, Jim walked around the store.  He picked up a small bag of potato chips, two small bottles of Snapple Tea (one for himself and the other for Chelsea), a case of Cokes, a car magazine and a roll of Certs.  At the checkout counter, there was a rack of toy cars.  Jim got a look at them.  There were so many, he had trouble deciding on which one he wanted to buy.  He finally decided on one, a red 1971 Camaro.  Jim thought he would put that one on his desk at Queen City Chevrolet.  After he paid for his purchases, he saw Chelsea walking toward him.  Jim asked Chelsea, ‚ÄúAre you ready to go to Faulkner Motors?‚Äù

 Chelsea answered, ‚ÄúYes, Dad.  About as ready as I can be.‚Äù

 Jim and Chelsea got in his Impala.  Jim handed Chelsea her bottle of Snapple Tea.  He drove to Faulkner Motors on South Mint Street.  He drove past Queen City Chevrolet.  He saw Mark and Jonathan with people looking at cars.  Jim seemed quite pleased with that.  Jim wanted to wave at them, but he doubted they would see him.

 Jim arrived at Faulkner Motors.  Right away, he saw Walter‚Äôs light blue 1967 Mustang and Renee‚Äôs dark blue late-model Mustang.  Both cars were parked on one side of the office.  There was a silver 2004 Cadillac Escalade parked on the other side.  Jim figured that would probably be the one.  He was anxious to check it out. 

 Jim parked in front of the office.  Walter and Renee quickly stepped out of the office.  They gave him a hug.  After Chelsea got out of Jim‚Äôs Impala, Walter and Renee gave her a hug.  Walter said, ‚ÄúJim, I‚Äôm happy you and Chelsea are here.  There‚Äôs something I wish to show you.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSure, Dad.  Let‚Äôs see the car.‚Äù

 Walter said, ‚ÄúSure, Jim.  But first, I want to show you two what I am planning on doing to Faulkner Motors.‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúSure, Dad.  Let‚Äôs see what you have in mind.‚Äù

 Walter took Jim and Chelsea around the lot.  He said, ‚ÄúFor starters, look at this parking lot.  It‚Äôs nothing but dirt and gravel.  And after it rains, it can get downright muddy.  That‚Äôs not good for the cars.  I do like them clean because clean ones can sell better.‚Äù

 Jim looked around in every direction.  He said, ‚ÄúYes, Dad.  I do agree.  That makes me glad the parking lot at Queen City Chevrolet is paved.‚Äù

 Then Walter said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.  And that brings me to another thing.  I‚Äôm planning on having this lot paved.  That‚Äôll make it better for Faulkner Motors.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúDad, I would agree.  Having a paved lot just may keep your vehicles cleaner.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúYes, Jim.  That‚Äôs why I want the parking lot paved.  I talked to Kate, Renee, Jerry and Paulina.  They all agree with me.‚Äù

 Jim continued to look around.  He got a look at the Charlotte skyline.  At the same time, he saw Renee showing Chelsea a dark gray Camaro with T-tops.  Chelsea told Jim that the Camaro she was looking at was a 1993 model.  But then, Jim realized something.  The car Renee was showing Chelsea was not a 1993 model.  It looked a lot newer.  Jim figured the model of the Camaro to be around 2001. 

 Meanwhile, Jim and Walter continued their conversation.  Jim asked Walter, ‚ÄúWhen do you plan on having the lot paved?‚Äù

 Walter answered, ‚ÄúI got some men coming next week to look at the lot.  If all goes well, I might be able to get it done around February or March.‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúOkay, Dad.  I hope it all goes well.‚Äù

 Then Walter said, ‚ÄúJim, come in the office.  There‚Äôs something else I‚Äôm planning on doing that I‚Äôd like to show you.‚Äù

 Walter took Jim into the office.  Walter showed Jim what appeared to be blueprints.  Walter spread the blueprints across the desk.  He said, ‚ÄúJim, I want you to be one of the first to see this.  I am planning on rebuilding the office building.  I‚Äôll also be adding a wheelchair ramp.  I‚Äôd like to make it more spacious, more comfortable for me, Renee, Paulina and the customers.‚Äù         

 Jim looked at the blueprints.  He said, ‚ÄúOkay, Dad.  This was the office building and storage building Pam Gilmore used when she ran the place.  I remember that storage building quite well.  When I started out here washing cars, Paulina and I would take out red wagons filled with cleaning stuff.  I remember it all quite well.‚Äù

 Walter said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.  I remember those wagons.  Renee, Paulina and I used them, too.  They still do.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to see those wagons are still holding out after all those years.‚Äù

 Then Walter said, ‚ÄúJim, I did speak to Pam Gilmore a couple days ago.  She said she would go along with these plans.  Pam agreed the office building needed a lot of repairs.  She also said she was planning on paving the parking lot before she sold the used car lot‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúSure, Dad.  I‚Äôd be willing to go along with your plans as well.‚Äù

 Walter said, ‚ÄúThe building will come first.  Some contractors were here a few days ago.  First, this office building will come down.  Your uncles will be here on Monday with a camper trailer.  That will serve as our office until the new one is built.  If all goes well, it could be completed in a few months.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúDad, that sounds good.  I cannot wait to see it when it‚Äôs all done.‚Äù

 Then Walter showed Jim something else.  It was an artist‚Äôs drawing of what the office building would look like when completed.  Walter said, ‚ÄúOf course, I‚Äôll put a couple drink machines in the front.  I‚Äôll make the steps, porch and wheelchair ramp out of concrete.  That‚Äôll make it stronger.  And I‚Äôm also thinking about putting some new lights in the front, and I‚Äôd like to put in another pole or two with security lights.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúThat sounds good.  More of those lights will be good for the car lot.‚Äù

 Then Walter showed Jim another drawing.  He said, ‚ÄúThis is what I‚Äôm hoping the inside will look like.  I‚Äôd like to put in another office or two.  I‚Äôll still have this desk.  I am also thinking about adding a computer desk.  And look at that table with the stereo on it.  I‚Äôm also considering getting a new large flat-screen TV and having it mounted on the wall.  And on another wall, I‚Äôll have a new larger pegboard to hold all the keys for all the cars.  And I also plan to have framed ads of cars on the walls.‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúOkay, Dad.  I have a question.  What about the storage building?  Do you have any plans for that?‚Äù

 Walter said, ‚ÄúYes, Jim.  The storage building will stay where it‚Äôs at.  But I plan to fix it up some.  And I may get a ‚Äòwet-dry‚Äô vacuum cleaner.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúDad, that‚Äôll be good.  Paulina and I tried to get Pam to get one.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúYeah, Jim.  I know.  Paulina told me that once.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúDad, it looks like you know what you want.  I think you got some good ideas for Faulkner Motors.‚Äù

 Then Walter brought up something else.  ‚ÄúJim, I‚Äôm also planning to get a smaller filing cabinet.  When I get a new computer for this place, all my files will be on it and I can just go to it when I need to.‚Äù

Then, Walter took Jim outside.  He said, ‚ÄúJim, there‚Äôs one more thing I wish to show you.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSure, Dad.  What is it?‚Äù

 Walter walked Jim to the side of the building where the Cadillac Escalade was.  He pointed to a building next door and said, ‚ÄúJim, I will be buying that old gas station next door.  I am going to hire an auto mechanic, and he can work on cars, and help me and Renee and Paulina out as well.‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúThat sounds great, Dad.  Have you got anyone in mind?‚Äù

Walter said, ‚ÄúMaybe.  I‚Äôm thinking of Scout Gilmore.  I understand the lease on his gas station is up soon and it may not be renewed.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúWhoa, Dad.  That‚Äôs the first I heard of that.‚Äù

 Jim knew that when Luke Holbrook died of cancer in 2004, he left the gas station to Scout because Luke felt he was the best man for it.  The gas station had been on East Morehead Street near Bethany Street since about the early fifties.  Nothing was ever said about a lease.  That blew Jim‚Äôs mind.  

 Walter said, ‚ÄúSo far, the only four people who know about this are you, me, Renee and Paulina.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúOkay, Dad.  I wish to find out more about this.  But for now, I‚Äôll just keep this between us.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, Jim.  I just hope we can get this thing off the ground soon.‚Äù

 Then Walter pointed to the car, and he said, ‚ÄúJim, there‚Äôs the car I want you to check out.  That silver Cadillac Escalade.  It‚Äôs a 2004 model.  We just got that car in.  Try it out.  If you don‚Äôt like it or it doesn't fit your needs, maybe you can try and find something better.‚Äù

 Jim walked around the Cadillac Escalade while Walter went into the office to get the key and a dealer tag.  As soon as Walter returned, he put the dealer tag on the vehicle.  He handed Jim the key, and he said, ‚ÄúJim, I got to go back in the office and make an important phone call.  Why don‚Äôt you take it out for a test drive?‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, Dad.  Sure.‚Äù

 Jim looked in the direction where Chelsea and Renee were standing.  Renee was showing Chelsea a dark gray Camaro.  Jim shouted for Chelsea, and he told her to come to where he was standing.  Chelsea ran to Jim.  He said to her, ‚ÄúChelsea, I‚Äôd like you to join me on a test drive.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSure, Dad.  Is that the car?‚Äù

 ‚ÄúYes, Chelsea.  It is.‚Äù

 Renee walked to where Jim and Chelsea were at.  She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to come along with you two, if that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

 Jim got a look inside the car.  As soon as he saw the inside, he was amazed by how spacious it was.  *Maybe this car will be good for our family*, Jim thought.  Renee said, ‚ÄúBelieve it or not, this thing is very easy on gas.  The last owner took super good care of it.  Why don‚Äôt we try it out?‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúSure.  Maybe this is the car I need.‚Äù       

 Jim said, ‚ÄúSure, Renee.  That‚Äôll be great.‚Äù

 Renee said, ‚ÄúOkay, then.  Just let me tell Dad.‚Äù

 Renee quickly went to the office to let Walter know that she would be joining Jim and Chelsea for the test drive.  She returned to the car just as quickly.

 Jim drove the car out of the lot.  Renee sat in the back seat, and Chelsea rode shotgun.  Jim got Chelsea to try out the radio and the heating and air conditioning.  Jim wanted to take his usual Queen City Chevrolet test drive route (South Tryon Street, Clanton Road, Interstate 77, John Belk Freeway and Carson Boulevard, in that exact order, then back to Queen City Chevrolet).  But Renee had another idea.  ‚ÄúJim, let‚Äôs go down South Mint Street, and then turn right on West Boulevard.‚Äù

Jim agreed with that.  He slowly passed Sydney‚Äôs Creations.  Chelsea saw Sydney‚Äôs red Camaro.  Chelsea rolled down the window, and she waved at Sydney.  Jim pulled into the parking lot.  He rolled down his window.  He told Sydney to go back in the parking lot so that she could see the Cadillac Escalade.  As soon as Sydney parked her Camaro, she walked to the Cadillac.  Renee got out, and she gave Sydney a hug.

 Sydney looked at the Cadillac Escalade.  Renee said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a 2004 and we got it just a couple days ago.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúJim, could we check it out?‚Äù Sydney asked.

 Jim answered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Sydney.  It looks quite big.  And besides, I‚Äôve never owned a Cadillac in my life.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúYes, Jim.  I know.  We all know that all you owned were Chevrolets.‚Äù

 Renee asked Sydney to get in and join them for the test drive.  Chelsea agreed to sit in the back seat with Renee, and Sydney would now ride shotgun.  Using her key fob, Sydney locked her Camaro, and Jim was back on the test drive.

 Jim drove down South Mint Street to West Boulevard, where he made a right turn.  Just as Chelsea did when the test drive started, Sydney worked the controls on the radio, heater and air conditioner.  Sydney looked around the car, and she said, ‚ÄúJim, this car is nice.  Is this going to be right for the family?‚Äù

 ‚ÄúYes, Sydney.  I feel it will be right for us.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúJim, there‚Äôs you and me and the five girls.  And what if we decide to have another baby or two?‚Äù

 Jim thought about that.  He knew Chelsea would soon have her own car.  Lauren was already driving but did not have her own car.  That left Lindsay, Valerie and Caitlyn.  Jim had not yet asked Sydney to marry him.  But he soon would.  Jim knew that, sooner or later, that question would come up.  But for now, Sydney wouldn‚Äôt ask that question.  Another question nagged in the back of Jim‚Äôs mind.  *Could Sydney be right about wanting another baby, or maybe two?*  

 Jim didn‚Äôt answer that question, at least for now.  He just continued driving the car.  Renee saw the look on Jim‚Äôs face, prompting her to ask him, ‚ÄúJim, is there a possibility you could want this Cadillac Escalade?‚Äù

 Jim took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and he said, ‚ÄúYes, Renee.  Maybe Sydney‚Äôs right.‚Äù

 Jim got onto Interstate 77, and then got off onto the John Belk Freeway.  As soon as Jim got onto Carson Boulevard, he said, ‚ÄúSydney, maybe you‚Äôre right.  Maybe we best look into something else.‚Äù

 Jim drove back to Faulkner Motors.  As he pulled into the lot, he made what would be his final decision on the car.  ‚ÄúYes, Renee.  I believe I will go with the Cadillac Escalade.‚Äù

 Renee said, ‚ÄúJim, you sound like you‚Äôre very sure about your decision.‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúYes, Dad.  I am.  Sydney thinks it could be better for my family.‚Äù

 Sydney said, ‚ÄúJim, *our* family.‚Äù

 Then Jim said, ‚ÄúAnd as for having another baby or two, we could think about that some.  But that will be further down the road.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúOkay, Jim.  I think you and Sydney both made a good choice,‚Äù Renee said.

 They all went back into the office.  After Jim filled out some paperwork and gave Walter a down payment, he was driving back to Bethany Street in a silver 2004 Cadillac Escalade. 

 It was a large down payment.  From the insurance check from the minivan, Jim left out enough to get Sydney‚Äôs engagement ring.  What was left was for the down payment, insurance and a new license plate.  Jim felt it was all worth it.  In a matter of days, Jim would ask Sydney to marry him.

 Jim dropped Sydney off at her office so that she could get her Camaro.  On the way home, Chelsea told Jim she had a car picked out.  It was a different car from the two she was looking at.  Chelsea said, ‚ÄúDad, I‚Äôm thinking about getting that dark gray 2001 Camaro.‚Äù

 Jim asked Chelsea, ‚ÄúWhat happened to the two cars you were looking at, the 1993 Camaro and the 1999 Chrysler?‚Äù

 Chelsea said, ‚ÄúThe 1993 Camaro had some holes in the seats that looked like they came from cigarettes, and it smelled like mold inside.  The Chrysler‚Äôs engine compartment looked very small.  Aunt Renee told me the battery was inside one of the wheel wells.  She also told me changing the battery would prove very difficult.‚Äù

 Jim added, ‚ÄúAnd Scout told me once he tried to change the oil in a Chrysler Sebring.  He had to take off the manifold just to change the oil and the spark plugs.‚Äù

 Chelsea said, ‚ÄúAunt Renee suggested the 2001 Camaro to me.  After all she said about the car, I feel it would be a good choice.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúChelsea, if you want to go back and look at it some more, please let me know and I‚Äôll be glad to take you back to Faulkner Motors.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúSure, Dad.  I‚Äôd like to go back sometime this weekend if that‚Äôs okay with you.‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúSure, Chelsea.  We can do that.‚Äù

üòä

 Jim parked in his driveway.  Sydney was behind him.  Jim left the Escalade in the driveway while Sydney parked her Camaro in the garage next to Jim‚Äôs Impala.  It wasn‚Äôt long before nearly everyone on Bethany Street ran to the Faulkner house.  Mark and his family arrived first, followed by the Holbrook bunch.  Kendra was pushing a stroller carrying baby Ambrosia, with Mark and Kendra‚Äôs three daughters behind them.  Autumn and her family showed up next, along with Tim and Cara.  April Lynn was on her cell phone with someone.  No one knew who April Lynn was speaking to.  Sure enough, everyone showed up to check out Jim‚Äôs new SUV.  It seemed as though Jim Faulkner was about the most important person on Bethany Street on this cool October afternoon.  Svetlana had not left yet.  She was one of the first to see the Cadillac Escalade.  She said, ‚ÄúJim, dear.  It looks like you made one good choice.‚Äù

 Jim said, ‚ÄúThanks, Svetlana.  I like it.  It has a lot of room.‚Äù

 Audrey pulled into her driveway in her car, a burgundy late-eighties model Jaguar she bought at Faulkner Motors a few years ago.  Audrey tried to run to Jim‚Äôs driveway as fast as she could in high heels (she was also wearing a burgundy business suit).  As soon as Audrey looked at the SUV, she said, ‚ÄúJim, I like this.  This is a good choice, especially with your family of five daughters.‚Äù

 ‚ÄúThanks, Audrey.  I feel I made a good choice.‚Äù

 Autumn looked inside the SUV.  She said pretty much the same thing.  While April Lynn was looking inside, Jim asked her, ‚ÄúApril Lynn, who were you talking to on your cell phone?‚Äù

 April Lynn answered, ‚ÄúI spoke to Russell and Scout Gilmore, and the Crabtree bunch.  I told them to come over and see your new vehicle.‚Äù

 Sure enough, they did.  Autumn and Alex, along with Tim and his daughters, showed up to check out the Cadillac Escalade.  The Gilmore bunch showed up in Scout‚Äôs truck.  Russell, Paulina, Crystal and her kids, Amina and Cassie were riding in the bed of the truck.  Pam was riding with Scout in the cab.  Vince drove behind Scout in his El Camino.  He brought Nikki and Marissa with him.  Tia drove behind Vince in her 1965 Cadillac.  While they were checking out the SUV, Jonathan brought the Marlowe bunch in his classic Bronco.  Then, Simon showed up, bringing Ariel, Jodi and Charmaine with him.  Ariel was pushing a stroller carrying the twin girls, Kaci and Lucy.  Everyone seemed impressed by Jim‚Äôs choice.  Later in the evening, Kurt, Hannah, Summer and Jeremy showed up, bringing Randy and Lori Barrett with them.  They saw the SUV as well.  The others, including Jim‚Äôs mother and half-siblings (Emily and Charlie, along with Rachel and Jerry), Malachi and Stacy Holbrook and their kids, and Amy Courtland and her kids, would see Jim‚Äôs Escalade during the weekend.

üòä

 The weekend came and went.  Jim and his family rode around Charlotte some in the Escalade.  On Saturday, Chelsea finally bought her first car, that dark gray 2001 Camaro she was looking at.

 On Sunday evening, Jim decided on something.  Using the idea he found in that magazine Simon gave him, Jim would use his die-cast car collection to pop the question to Sydney.

 He would set that special moment for the second weekend in November.",creativewriting,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/pc8rjh/friends_and_family_a_new_beginning_chapter_22/,,jim21869,pc8rjh,/r/creativewriting/comments/pc8rjh/friends_and_family_a_new_beginning_chapter_22/,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/pc8rjh/friends_and_family_a_new_beginning_chapter_22/,0,2021-08-26
I tried to veto a couple and my husband wouldn‚Äôt accept it,"My husband and I are still relatively new to LS and figuring things out. In the past, when I said ‚Äúno‚Äù to something LS related, such as hooking up with a particular couple, he used to get very angry at me, yell, cause a scene, and cause some serious fights between us. We ended up taking a break from LS and going to therapy where he has been working on his anger and communication skills. We decided to give it another try recently. Just last week, we were supposed to go on a date just for us. Last minute, he said he wanted to invite this couple he‚Äôs been chatting with. I protested because I was planning on a date just us and wanted that to be the focus. He begged me until I said fine but didn‚Äôt show me their pictures until we were 5 min from meeting them. As soon as we met them out, I knew I didn‚Äôt feel a physical attraction to them but they were super nice and I didn‚Äôt want to just leave immediate and be rude. A few drinks later I told me husband that although they‚Äôre very cool I just don‚Äôt feel an attraction. He proceeded to question me and push back. He said if I loved him I would find a way to go along with this. In a last ditch effort, he tried to get me to agree to letting him play with them while I watch (not what we normally do, we always play together and no one is ever left out). When I told the other couple I‚Äôm sorry but I need to go home, my husband, in front of them, said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not inviting them over??‚Äù It was so awkward and embarrassing..

It felt like he prioritized his own wants and needs over our relationship and this Is not the first time. But when we talked about it after, he pointed out how much progress he has made (like he doesn‚Äôt throw tantrums anymore when he doesn‚Äôt get his way) and wants to stay in LS. He said if I want to end LS stuff I‚Äôm ‚Äúgiving up on him.‚Äù Am I being too unforgiving when I tell him I want to stop? Is this something that couples ‚Äúwork on‚Äù?",u_SkyNewport,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SkyNewport/comments/pc89ss/i_tried_to_veto_a_couple_and_my_husband_wouldnt/,,SkyNewport,pc89ss,/r/u_SkyNewport/comments/pc89ss/i_tried_to_veto_a_couple_and_my_husband_wouldnt/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SkyNewport/comments/pc89ss/i_tried_to_veto_a_couple_and_my_husband_wouldnt/,0,2021-08-26
The Carpetbag," More times than not, the human brain does not recollect it‚Äôs past decisions, good or bad. Though predominantly one can identify their failed decisions and learn to correct them. Some people call it your conscience. Over the years it‚Äôs identity has shifted from that of a small cricket, to a voice in your ear, to an internal dialogue, and back again. Though it‚Äôs true form is merely a strain of diagnostic programming that runs silently in the back of all of our minds. One felt, but never heard nor seen.

As a human being, the thought of seeing my own thoughts is bone chilling. Our brains produce so many conflicting thoughts, our vision would be constantly blurred. In fact, I am willing to bet money that our eyes would fizzle out and die before properly conveying our thoughts. So sitting here writing this, I have to ask myself; how are we led to believe our own thoughts? Our opinions form to no internal conflict, yet are immediately ingrained in our subconscious.

Looking back it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly when the hell broke loose. I think it was somewhere just North of London, maybe around Cambridge or Northampton. I was working as a clerk in a small grocer on a busy downtown street when the man stopped in. He spoke with a bizarre sort of accent I hadn‚Äôt heard before, and growing up near Birmingham amidst a typhoon of immigration and asylum seekers, I‚Äôd heard my fair share of accents.

The lad came in sporting a tweed blazer and trousers with a dowdy sort-of carpetbag. His English was so busted up he could barely put together a sentence, but he sputtered something out about the bag and left it on my counter. Suspecting him to be some sort of dosser, I returned his back and tried to send him out. The man wouldn‚Äôt budge. Kept yelling for me to take the bag, thrusting it into my arms.

Silently taking the bag, I placed it behind the counter. The man tipped his hat and left the shop. I watched him slowly meander back down the street. He was oddly happy to be rid of the bag, now that I think of it. I suppose that should have been my first red flag.

My shift ended around eight that evening, and I took the trolley back up to my flat a few blocks over, carpetbag in hand. I forced myself to wait until I returned home before sneaking a peek inside. Honestly I should have looked when he first gave it to me, to make sure he wasn‚Äôt handing off drugs or weapons or something.

I walked up the steps to my building and approached the massive early-century lifts ‚Äòround the back. As I pulled across the gate I got a terrible whiff of some god-forsaken scent. At first I thought it was from the bag but it seemed to be rising from the floorboards. With one hand I pinched my nose, with the other I pulled the lever to floor four. The lever stuck a bit as usual, but it seemed to take off fairly quickly. The ground shook below me slightly as the thick bands rose me to the fourth floor. It‚Äôs always terribly unnerving to ride such a decrepit machine, you never know when it‚Äôs going to kick out.

It smashed to a halt as it arrived at my level. My nose still pinched shut, I threw back the gate with my other hand. Luckily the smell dissipated a bit as I left the lift behind, and continued my trek down the cramped corridors.

The sort of clientele a place like this usually gets, aren‚Äôt the desirable type. Walking through this place you‚Äôre constantly eyeing behind you to make sure you don‚Äôt get jumped. It had only ever happened to me once, but luckily I had retained a bit of my training from my boxing days. A man seemed to follow me from a few metres past the lift, but he turned into another flat shortly before I reached mine.

I don‚Äôt know why I chose such an awful place to live. It was at the very bottom of my budget, and the building was eighty-odd years old and in terrible disrepair. My water would come out tainted and bitter, my windows jammed with a near century of grime, yet I refuse to leave. As disgusting as the place is, it also has a certain charm that you don‚Äôt see in these modern places. I can almost picture a starving Victorian family poised about my kitchen counter.

I removed my overcoat, placing the bag on the aforementioned counter. Switching on the radio, I searched through my icebox for something suitable for dinner. The host on the radio was reading off some sort of news bulletin, some nonsense about the world series over sea, a bible film releasing with Charlton Heston. Nothing I would pay money for.

A layed out a tin of sausages with a bottle of milk. I emptied the tin into a small pan and fried them until they charred slightly. I chopped up a bit of cabbage and drenched it in some boiled water. It was a pretty basic meal, but it‚Äôs what I could afford.

I laid it all out on a small plate, the sausages resting on a bed of softened cabbage, and pulled the bag near my place setting. I hadn‚Äôt really gotten a good look at it until now. It had a small bit of weight to it, though nothing I couldn‚Äôt manage. There was a definite bulge in the side as well. Along the top was a metal three-piece snap that seemed to be rusted shut. It truly was a sight to behold,

I tried to unbuckle the snap, but it was rusted so badly it couldn‚Äôt be budged. I ended up lining it up with the edge of my counter, and breaking it off with a hammer. The metal was very weak, and broke off with one soft blow. I brought the bag back down to the table and pulled back the sides. Positioned sideways inside lay a long wooden sculpture, possibly an idol or a religious object. Resting lengthway on the table, it stood about a foot tall. Intricately hand carved and stained with some sort of natural element, possibly coffee, it had a certain aura about it that just made me feel uneasy. I probably sat staring at the object for half an hour, unsure of exactly what the figure carved was. In the end I decided it was probably a monkey, but I still wasn‚Äôt sure.

As bizarre as the sculpture was, I was drawn to it. I placed it in the middle of my coffee table on top of some photography books. I had barely any decoration here, and I thought this would make a nice start.

I finished my supper, and prepared for bed, hanging the carpetbag on my coat rack. Tomorrow I would take the sculpture to my friend Terry at the pawn shop near the grocer to see if he had any idea what it was.

I changed into some pajamas, and began to tuck myself into my sheets, when from down the hall I heard a loud crash. It sounded like something fell, so naturally I went to make sure nothing broke. As I entered the living room, I could see the idol on the ground, surrounded by some glass shrapnel. Where the glass came from, I have no idea. I thought it might have been inside of the idol or something but there didn‚Äôt seem to be any remnants inside of the sculpture. I looked around trying to identify the glass‚Äôs origins, but I truly couldn‚Äôt find where it came from. I later found out that the glass was a part of a lightbulb from a lamp. However the hell it ended up on the floor in the middle of the room, I have no clue.

I cleaned up the spill, placing the idol and the glass in a paper bag near my sink. When I got up tomorrow morning I would deal with it then. I was too tired to deal with it then. I returned to my bedroom, and cracked open the window. In the distance the sounds of sirens and disgruntled marriages filled the dark, wet night, and I slowly drifted to sleep.

A few hours later I was awoken by what I suspected to be a gunshot in the alleyway below my flat. I pulled myself up, and looked out the window to see a man in a dark jacket, bleeding out on the cobble below. I yelled for him, yet he was unresponsive.

I ran to my living room, frantically calling the emergency line on my telephone, realizing shortly after that the paper bag was missing. With the phone in one hand, receiver held in my shoulder, I searched frantically for the bag. I could‚Äôve sworn that I had put it near the sink, but it just wasn‚Äôt there.

The operator picked up shortly after I called, and I explained that there was a man who was shot in my alleyway. I stayed on until the police showed up, and I took the fire escape down to meet them. Before I met the police, I got a quick look at the body of the man. He was an older gentleman, around fifty or sixty, with short parted hair and a tight drawn mouth. He was clearly deceased. Both of his hands were clenched in tight white-knuckled fists, one of them holding a brown paper bag.

The bag‚Äôs bottom was busted out, revealing the shards of glass, but no idol. I surveyed the man‚Äôs body once more, trying to locate where he may have stashed it. I saw something tucked in below his coat, but I dare not reach for it, as the police had just pulled up.

They went through all the basic stuff they had to, took my statement, and did a once over of the man‚Äôs body. They seemed to think that he was caught stealing the bag from my flat, and was shot by someone else as he exited, then fell down to the ground. They didn‚Äôt understand why he would just steal a paper bag. As they took the bag from him, I told them that there should be some glass fragments and a wooden statue, though they only found the glass.

As they loaded the man into an ambulance, they told me to return to my flat. They ended up taking the bag and the glass fragments, though they still could not find the idol. Honestly, I was kind of relieved. As curious as the object was, it was sort of creepy too. I climbed back up the escape, and returned to my bed, closing the window this time.

The following morning I woke up around six-o‚Äôclock, and prepared myself for the morning shift at the grocery. I changed into something a little more presentable than stained pajamas, and fixed myself some toast and cheese. Leaving the carpetbag at home, I drifted off into the early morning air.

I marched down the street with a sort of arrogance in my step. I was rid of the idol, and I could just continue with my life. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about bizarre oddities given to me by strange men. Hell, it could have even been a dream.

I purchased a paper from the newsboy on the corner, wondering if there would be any information about what I saw last night. A few pages back, a small article detailed the man‚Äôs death, although they were no longer using the shooting story. Apparently in the man‚Äôs side pocket was a wooden trinket that impaled him when he fell from the fire escape. The loud bang I heard must have been from when he fell. The little trinket I held in my hands was the cause of a man‚Äôs death.

I threw the paper in the trash and continued on my way to work, trying to rid my mind of the idol. A small line had already formed outside of the shop, people eager to spend their newly acquired paychecks. Amongst the lineup was the man whom I had met in the store yesterday, neatly shaven with slicked back hair. He purchased an orange, and left.

The rush from the morning dissipated around noon, and I had very little to do for the rest of the day. I ended up purchasing a pulp novel from the rack near the cash, and read it cover to cover. The story wasn‚Äôt too exciting, but it was enough to get me through the day.

I locked up around seven, and stopped at a take-out place on the corner across the road. I bought a little package of fried fish and some chips, and took it back to my flat. The aroma was overwhelming. I could hardly wait to taste it.

I entered the small key into my door, and pushed it open. A horrendous smell engulfed me as I entered, almost as if something was rotting inside. I opened the windows in the sitting room, and fanned the room with a dish cloth. I placed the fish by the oven and switched on the radio. Nothing but static.

I went to place my hat on the coat rack, when I noticed the carpetbag had fallen to the ground. Pulling it back up, I noticed there was a significant heft to it that wasn‚Äôt there before. I pulled the bag around to the counter, and opened the top slightly to peak inside. A cloud of stench arose from the bag, and I was forced to close it immediately. It definitely didn‚Äôt smell like that yesterday.

I wrapped a cloth around my face, and opened the flaps once again to reveal one of the most horrifying sights I had ever seen. Inside the bag, resting on a bed of cabbage, lay the decapitated head of the man whom I had witnessed die last night. Stuck in his mouth was the idol, positioned to make him look like a Kalua pig. I immediately closed the bag in a panic, not knowing what to do with it. I threw the bag out of my window into the street below.

I knew immediately how incriminating that looked, so I ran down the fire escape to try and fetch in before somebody grabbed it. As I tore around the corner, a crowd had formed around a man with a massive wound on his forehead. He kept screaming about a bag.

An old lady told me that a bag had fallen from one of the windows upstairs, and some jagged metal bit had lacerated his forehead. I immediately asked where the bag went, and nobody nearby knew. I searched insanely for about ten minutes trying to find the bag in the shrubbery to no avail.  I ended up returning to my room, praying that the police wouldn‚Äôt stop by to question me. The cut on the head is one thing, but if they opened the bag‚Ä¶

I started pacing the floor, terrified at the thought of being framed for this murder. I had to lay down on my sofa to prevent myself from spiraling. How did the head and the idol get back in the bag? Where did the idol even go in the first place? Did the man even steal the idol in the first place?

I dozed out around nine-thirty, waking up again at midnight. The scent was back, and it was even more powerful than before. I rolled off of the couch and started moving towards the smell, which I had narrowed down to the closet in the hall.

I covered my nose and mouth with a towel, and shakily threw back the door to the closet. The smell was horrifying. I could taste it in the back of my throat. The sight in the closet still haunts me nearly forty years later. The man‚Äôs head, eyes rolled up, rested on the top shelf. His arms and torso in the middle tier. His legs on the bottom. On the ground in a pool of blood lay the idol, broken open to reveal a mounted crystal

I picked up the idol in a bewildered haze, and sent it flying through my window into the street below, sending bits of glass all over the floor. Dropping to my knees, I halt, staring into the man‚Äôs rolled eyes. I was either dreaming, or something much more sinister was taking place.

I dropped onto my back and lay there in the middle of the floor. To my right, the crystal lay glimmering in the moonlight, inscribed with some sort of Chinese character. I threw it through the same hole in the window.

So there I lay, just staring off into space, praying that this was a dream.

My landlord came by a while later to see why there was a whole in the window. I didn‚Äôt answer the door. I just laid there. I was removed by paramedics a few hours later. I still don‚Äôt know where the idol is, or when it will be back. I just know that it will be. It will be back.

How to Pick Winning Powerball Numbers,"If you are looking for a sure way with which you can pick winning Powerball numbers, you've come to the right place. This article tells you how to pick winning Powerball numbers so you can come out successful in a Powerball draw.

Powerball has no doubt reached the peak of its popularity these past months. Internet searches for online sites that host Powerballs have doubled in numbers. Moreover, more and more people are logging online to find out how to pick winning Powerball numbers in the hopes of winning the next Powerball draw and taking home the jackpot or any Powerball prize. But what is Powerball in the first place? How do you play it?

Powerball, the first game ever to use two drums in its core game, is an all-American lottery game that is being sold through United States lotteries as one of the shared jackpot pool games. The Multi-State Lottery Association or MUSL, which is a non-profit organization created by an official agreement understood by all member lotteries, coordinates the workings of Powerball, which includes the development of new games, management of finances, conduction of draws, and other services. Thus, there are several states - thirty-one all in all - that offer Powerball. Because Powerball makes use of not just one but two drums, it allows more flexibility as far as game design it concerned, attracting more players compared with other lotto games. It has a higher possibility of low odds for other prizes but high odds for the jackpot. This two-drum feature is now being used by the United Kingdom's EuroMillions and Thunderball, Australia's Powerball, and the United States' Mega Millions.

In order to know how to pick winning Powerball numbers, you must first know how to play the game. The first thing you have to do is to choose five numbers ranging from one to fifty-five. These are the white balls. Then you have to choose one number ranging from one to forty-two. This is the red ball, also known as the Powerball. Most Powerball hosts offer a Power Play feature, which makes use of a random multiplier through the use of a special wheel. What can be multiplied are the prizes in all levels except the main prize or the jackpot.

People who play Powerball should know how to pick winning Powerball numbers because the chances of winning in this particular lotto game is higher compared to the chances of winning offered by other lotto games. In fact, the overall probability of winning a Powerball prize is one in thirty-six (35.1, to be precise), and this ratio is said to go higher in the coming year. In February of 2006, the jackpot was won by one ticket in Nebraska, and the amount was a stunning $365 million, shared by eight workers in a meat plant. If you want to have the same luck, you need to employ a good amount of logic first.

The most sound advice on how to pick winning Powerball numbers is to use a software package that analyzes the odds of winning according to the odds of certain numbers coming up in a Powerball draw. Many Powerball winners have expressed their support for this kind of strategy for a number of reasons. For one, using a software package deals away with any emotional attachment that may cloud your judgment in choosing possible winning numbers. Another reason is that using a software package allows you to see the history of all the draws and the numbers that usually come up. History repeats itself, so they say, and this really holds true in lottery games.",powerballwe,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/powerballwe/comments/pc5ln1/how_to_pick_winning_powerball_numbers/,,EdgeFew7154,pc5ln1,/r/powerballwe/comments/pc5ln1/how_to_pick_winning_powerball_numbers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/powerballwe/comments/pc5ln1/how_to_pick_winning_powerball_numbers/,0,2021-08-26

23 [M4F] Looking for good roleplayers! Prompts below-,"
1. **Suhaagrat in arranged marriage and further**- You have been married with a guy who you barely know. How do the think the first night will go? How do you think your life will be after that?

2. **Neglected mother x new son-in-law**- Your new son in law has been keeping your princess daughter happy beyond your imagination. However he is not shy in showing his affection for you, his old forgotten mother in law. Will you give in to his advances?

3. **Maami / maasi / chachi / any aunt x nephew** - He used to be the cute bright kid. Now he is the young man who is strong enough to pick you and carry you to the bedroom and successful enough to buy you anything you might want. Do you think its okay to share details of your boring marriage with him? Maybe your desires? Or maybe the fact that you know he checks you out?

4. **Team manager / lead x the junior colleague**- Managing or leading a team is always stressful. But it all can be managed if you can have a  little fun with them too. Maybe the shy junior guy, who has a thing for strong successful women like you. Come, use this boy toy.

5. **Maid x bachelor employer**- Bachelors are often not the ideal employers. They are usually dirty, messy and would ogle at you with red lust filled eyes. But they pay well and dont care about the quality of the work. Would you wanna work for a bachelor who is not a complete animal and actually is bold enough to show his interest in you with proper courting?

6. **Maid x employer's son** - What do you do when you find the young hot handsom son of the house where you work at, always staring at you and trying to flirt when no one is around?

7. **Girl x bestie's boyfriend**- Best friends for life. That means that her bf is your frnd yet always off limits. What if you catch him looking at you and trying to be close to you? What if she didn't know anything? What if you have something which she doesn't, something which he really really wants?

8. **Girl x guy best friend** - Girls and guys can be friends, even best friends. It usually gets awkward but its possible. You had such a friend in college but you guys fell apart as you got a bf and he got a gf. Or maybe he tried to objectify you, commented how big your boobs were. Fast forward a couple of years and some apologizing from him, you decide you need him back, as a frnd obviously. How will it go? Do you think you will find him attractive as well, given that he has become 10x hotter?

9. **Cousin sister x cousin brother**- Being the successful child means that you have to guide all the younger ones in the family. And now you have a 2 bhk flat, you have to share it with your younger cousin brother, who you haven't seen in years. Why - because he got a job in the same field aa you did, so far away from home. As his sister its your job to help him. Do you know he has had a massive crush on you all these years?

10. **Housewife x pervy neighbour** - Almost all men in their 20s are pervs. What do you do when you realise the guy living next to you, maybe alone or maybe with his family, is checking you out whenever you can see him. Do you put on a show for him? Or do you ask him to help around the house?

11. **Landlady x young hot tenant**- Nobody wants to host bachelors. Everyone knows why. However your hubby decided to let this one rent the 1bhk apartment on the top floor as he was smart, worked in a good company, respectful, looked clean, basically was a gentleman. He is a wolf in sheep's skin? Would he try to seduce the hot landlady? 

12. **Successful entrepreneur x inexperienced boy toy** - Who doesn't love attention? Being adored and worshipped. And more than that, getting all that from someone who knows how to respect you, is smart enough to match your intellectual level and open minded when it comes to bedroom. Basically someone who is willing to worship and please you, just the way you want. If you are a successful woman, finding a young man like him would mean all your stress melting away and better productivity, right?

13. **Professor x the bright student**- Cliche but true, all students fantasise about their hot professors. What do you do when you find out the smartest one in your class cant keep his bulge down when he is near you?

14. **Enemies**- We all have someone whom we hate. The mere sight of them turns our mood sour and makes us wanna kill them. What if you find yourself in close proximity of such a person from your last? Maybe he has become more obnoxious or hotter. Do you think you can channel all that hate into hate fuck?

15.  **The internet buyer** - You must have seen countless guys online asking for pics and numbers. One day you see a request from a guy asking if he can buy your used underwear/socks/ or  maybe your milk in exchange for good money. What do you think would happen if you reply to it? 

*NOTE - We can convert any plot into a longer rp like chapters or slice of life.*

**Kinks - cheating, affairs and taboo relationships, bareback/ unprotected sex, inneundos, slow burn realistic desi scenes, breeding, lactation, sweat, armpits, spit, piss, asshole sniffing, licking, eating, using dirty words during sex, getting rough, risky situations, hidden relationships, rough hate fucks**

If you are interested, please send me a message or a chat. I use Discord too.",dirtykikpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/pc5ei9/23_m4f_looking_for_good_roleplayers_prompts_below/,M4F,hiwatarikail,pc5ei9,/r/dirtykikpals/comments/pc5ei9/23_m4f_looking_for_good_roleplayers_prompts_below/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/pc5ei9/23_m4f_looking_for_good_roleplayers_prompts_below/,0,2021-08-26
Need a reminder this is okay and I will be okay,"I got divorced and moved to a new city right before the pandemic. I came here for work, and even made some new friends quickly. Most of the new friendships didn't survive the pandemic, and even the ones that did survive, still feel new and like I can't be dumping a bunch of heavy depression s*** there. A lot of my old friends, I feel like I lost in the divorce. I don't even necessarily feel abandoned, I just feel like the same reasons why I felt like my marriage wasn't working is why I felt like my career wasn't working and why my friendships weren't working. I had built an inauthentic life around trying to be a ""good girl"" to overcompensate for my dark past, mostly stuff related to the fact I was a teenage drug addict. I know sometimes people go through periods like this in life, and I know I really have to take care of myself and love myself to heal. 

I also come from a dysfunctional family and have experienced childhood trauma. My parents are wackos haha, but still supportive with logistical and financial life stuff. That's a huge help to me, but they are completely emotionally unavailable. I mention that not because I'm angry with them anymore, but to highlight the point that I really have no one to talk about my feelings to right now. I wish I had the kind of mom where I can just pick up the phone and cry and she will be empathetic, but I don't. I do have a couple girlfriends at home that I could talk to about stuff like this but everybody's going through so much s*** right now. I feel like I got a lot of support from one friend in particular, and I know friends should be there for you, but I do think in order to protect the friendship I can't drain her compassion. So I am lucky enough to be able to chit chat with her  throughout my week but I don't want to dump this on her either.

I got really close to a couple guys over the pandemic. Both were monogamous relationships, one after another. The first one ending made me really sad, probably because I got too attached to the first guy I dated after leaving my husband. Still, the breakup happened unceremoniously, and despite that, he pushed to stay friends. Then, he told me this *really* elaborate and unnecessary lie two weeks in our ""friendship"" to cover for the fact that he was visiting an ex, and had already moved away from our city. He was literally going to drive four hours to drive me to the airport to keep up the charade. But it was after we already broke up? And the reason why he was driving me to the airport was that so I could go visit my ex-husband who I was friends with which he knew.  I was so confused at how unnecessary the whole thing was, and I was pretty hurt since I thought we were close. I ignored my intuition-- that exes probably shouldn't be friends this soon, and then I was the one who got hurt even though my idea of not talking was probably wiser. I was really disappointed in myself for not being stronger, and haven't talked to him since. I also experienced another (family) relationship loss due to a pretty intense conflict right before this happened. That was partly why I was hurt-- he knew I was stinging from feeling like I thought I was really close to a couple family members who set me straight--apparently were weren't! It's obviously for the best, but this happened as pandemic winter was approaching and I fell into a super deep, dark depression. I gave myself almost no time to heal and a month after we broke up I started my second relationship in the pandemic.

As you can imagine, the second one just ended and I feel really gutted, even though I know I need time alone and to heal some codependent habits. I felt like he was the first guy that really saw all of me, but we have some pretty big compatibility issues. He wrote this email to his ex that I saw. I looked sometime in June, because I just had an intuition that something was off when I took a trip in March and it had been nagging at me for months. I tried directly speaking to him about my intuitive feeling, but he kept dismissing me. I honestly don't even feel guilty for looking. He sent this really sappy part-love note/part-closure note to his ex. It was written so tenderly, and he really isn't that way with me. But I'm old enough to know that that's part of his dysfunction. He may have written her sweeter love notes than I ever got, but he also cheated on her and was a pretty shity boyfriend to her, too. The other reason why the email probably was sappy is cuz he was drinking when you wrote it. I'm pretty sure he's an alcoholic. So anyone reading this would be like, okay, sounds like you got of a relationship that wasn't worth saving and maybe you aren't picking the best guys, which I do believe is true. I just really struggle with the part where I feel like no one understands me and where I am at right now, and he was the closest thing to having that understanding from another person. He knows what it's like to have dysfunctional relationships and a drug problem, and conversely he knows what it's like to want to take in all of  life's experience and drink in what nature has to offer to try to release the pain and be free from the pain of trauma. 

I wish I had friends to hang out with and have fun with and I felt close to. I have plans for the weekend to watch a movie with a couple girls and I'm paying someone else I know to help me with a big project that is really cool. So I know I'm not completely alone, but it really feels that way. It feels like I'm never going to get to be a mom. It feels like no one's ever going to love me.

My ex-husband  and I maintained a friendship but sometimes I think that wasn't a good idea either. Sometimes it feels like he comes to me to talk out complicated situations, even in his dating life, but when I told him I'm having a really hard time letting go of this last ex and that not contacting him was hard for me, he just said, ""I hope you find what works for you!"" This is about a week after I spent almost two hours on the phone with him as he was trying to get over a girl that he had a one-night stand with haha... What! I guess I just added my ex-husband to the chopping block, and I texted him I needed some support right now and I wasn't sure if he'd be able to support me so maybe we should take a break from our chats until I'm a little more clear on what I'm feeling. I do kind of feel like it can be a one-way friendship which is how our marriage felt sometimes. I had an easy time staying friends with him because I'm the one who made the decision to leave and it wasn't a sudden decision. I had a lot of time to get to a place of friendship on my own, but I do wonder why he also pushed to stay friends just like these other two guys wanted to do. Unlike the other two guys I never had sex with my ex after leaving him. 

I can't help but think I've ruined my life because of these sorts of patterns with boyfriends and now an exhusband. Is there something wrong with me? Why dont i feel appreciated by men?Why is it so hard for me to feel loved. I have such a hard time clicking with any therapists and I got really burnt out trying to find a good one after the first ex left. I don't know how much of this is a blind spot in a pattern I need to be made aware of, and how much of it is just normal pain from normal human relationships. All I I know is that I'm in a world of pain. And compounding my loneliness is the fact that I left my religious community because of certain issues I had with it and now all this pain sort of feels like God is punishing me, on top of losing all those relationships. Do you think I'll be okay? What do I keep doing wrong that makes me feel so unbearably alone?",alone,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/pc5gnl/need_a_reminder_this_is_okay_and_i_will_be_okay/,,Ok-Career1753,pc5gnl,/r/alone/comments/pc5gnl/need_a_reminder_this_is_okay_and_i_will_be_okay/,https://www.reddit.com/r/alone/comments/pc5gnl/need_a_reminder_this_is_okay_and_i_will_be_okay/,0,2021-08-26

However your hubby decided to let this one rent the 1bhk apartment on the top floor as he was smart, worked in a good company, respectful, looked clean, basically was a gentleman. He is a wolf in sheep's skin? Would he try to seduce the hot landlady? 

12. **Successful entrepreneur x inexperienced boy toy** - Who doesn't love attention? Being adored and worshipped. And more than that, getting all that from someone who knows how to respect you, is smart enough to match your intellectual level and open minded when it comes to bedroom. Basically someone who is willing to worship and please you, just the way you want. If you are a successful woman, finding a young man like him would mean all your stress melting away and better productivity, right?

13. **Professor x the bright student**- Cliche but true, all students fantasise about their hot professors. What do you do when you find out the smartest one in your class cant keep his bulge down when he is near you?

14. **Enemies**- We all have someone whom we hate. The mere sight of them turns our mood sour and makes us wanna kill them. What if you find yourself in close proximity of such a person from your last? Maybe he has become more obnoxious or hotter. Do you think you can channel all that hate into hate fuck?

15.  **The internet buyer** - You must have seen countless guys online asking for pics and numbers. One day you see a request from a guy asking if he can buy your used underwear/socks/ or  maybe your milk in exchange for good money. What do you think would happen if you reply to it?

[M4GM] Looking for monster girls,"Hey! So as the title suggests, I‚Äôm looking for someone to play as a monster girl or several of them in an Rp for me. 

One idea that I had in mind for plot, was a sort of revenge quest: after my home is ransacked and destroyed, I set out for revenge with the surviving monster girl, encountering others among the way. 
Another idea I had was to leave home for a quest to prove myself with one of the monsters accompanying me as a sort of guide. These of course present more of a GM role for you.

If you had any ideas, don‚Äôt hesitate to say so, I‚Äôd love to hear!

Kinks and limits can be discussed over Kik, but I will say now that I‚Äôm not into transformation, hyper, inflation, or non con. Please don‚Äôt just ‚Äújump‚Äù straight into an rp. 

I only rp on kik, my username is zatguy101. 

I am 18+ and every person and character involved with this rp must also be 18+

Black Dancer," 

Abigail Tasman became a sister in the mystery with a purpose. She wished to get away from the painful existence humans brought upon this reality. The sister was misanthropic and filled with hatred down to her bones. She hated the fruits of the Anthropocene, and she hated the children of Adam more than anything else. There was no real reason behind her burning disdain. Some people are just born different. She was one of those. Sister Tasman was a human with a pitched black soul.

For three long and painful years, she had toiled, rising the ranks of her mystery. Three arduous years during which she studied the dark arts and refined her craft. They have finally paid off. At the center of the temple, she stood ready to summon her chthonic god, finally to rid the planet of the filthy cretins that swarmed its surface. Sister Tasman stood at the center of a black candle circle. Clad in a simple black dress. Her fellow brothers and sisters stood all around her, chanting in an archaic language most people could never understand.

Clutching the obsidian knife in her hand, Abigail cut Stigmata all across her arms, straight through the sleeves of her dress. Once she finished producing her blood offering to the god below, Abigail placed the obsidian blade beneath her tongue. She bit on it as hard as she could to ensure she could not scream. Red language poured through the fabric and onto the floor beneath the sister as she raised her arms into the air. Along with her crimson humor, burning pain flowed across her self-sacrificed limbs.

Abigail closed her eyes and began spinning in her place. Ignoring the pain as hard as she could. She breathed in and out, clearing her head of all thoughts. A mesmerizing red-colored tail formed from the language pouring out of the sister‚Äôs body. She spun faster and faster, completely devoting her body and mind to her Sophy dance of primordial darkness. Before long, everything disappeared, and sister Abigail Tasman completely submerged herself within the void.

Finally, at peace, she detached her psyche, her soul from the last threads that tethered her to the earthly reality. The black dancer was one with the cold, empty cosmos. She was one with the dark matter that kept everything together. She was omnipresent and non-present at once. Everywhere and nowhere. Alive and dead. In a perfect balance between existence and oblivion.

She was free.

At last.

The other members of the mystery stopped chanting once Abigail‚Äôs blood began floating around her. Assuming their evocation had worked and their beloved master was on his way, they all prostrated themselves on the floor before the rotating mass at the center of their temple.

The black dancer wouldn‚Äôt stop spinning, however, and no deity came from within the gyrating mass. Soon enough, the realization that nothing was going to crawl out of the spinning black materia set in. Looking at it, they saw an ellipsoid shape of black and red colors spinning on its axis at an ever-increasing speed. Compressing itself slowly into itself. They remained fixated on the object for a while. They soon came to realize that the strange thing was bending space around its parameter, made clear by the abnormal curvature of the floor beneath it.

The black dancer swirled itself into a nearly perfect circle before stopping in its place. An orb of pure blackness at the center of the temple. Floating at the total center of it all. Forcing the surrounding space to bend to its malicious will. Curving the room into odd shapes whenever it came into contact with the circular void.

One member of the mystery approached the round nothingness. She contacted the thing. Her touch was disastrous. Ripples tore through the member as she came too close to the black dancer. A sudden sharp pain tore through her head, which was closest to the black mass, and then nothing.

At all.

An explosion of bright lights emanated. A chaotic rainbow of impossible lights too alien to be described by a human language It burst forth violently from within the black mass enveloping the entire temple. The sudden cascade of luminescence temporarily blinded remaining members who watched the unfolding with the utmost reverence.

Once the Luciferian bombardment of shades had finally died down, something strange revealed itself. A small, fleeting strip of white spinning across the surface of the black dancer. Thus, the high priest concluded that the black dancing sphere was absorbing everything it came into contact with.

The ritual turned out to be a failure, for the chthonic god had not risen. Moreover, the mystery had lost two sisters. They concluded that the black dancer was too dangerous to be left alone, hence the mystery had to abandon worship inside the temple. The high priest designated five members of the mystery to watch over the black dancing orb to make sure it won‚Äôt cause any more damage to the mystery.

Time passed, but the black dancer kept on spinning the space and reality all around it. Until it stopped.

The black dancer finally slowed down, shedding its pure black mass over time as it got slower and slower. Eventually leaving behind nothing but the glowing form of a young human woman. The woman eventually stopped spinning entirely.

Once she did, she opened her eyes and surveyed her surroundings. The temple all around her was desolate. Time corroded its remains and pathetic, leaving behind a pathetic shell. A few human bones laid strewn across the surrounding floor. They were caramel brown and painfully ancient, marked by clear signs of weathering and abuse at the hands of the elements. Abigail Tasman walked for the first time in a long time when she moved from the ground she danced upon. Accidentally, she stepped on a skull that disintegrated beneath her measly weight. The woman smiled as a chilly speck of dust caressed her skin.

She followed the speck of dust until she found herself outside of her temple‚Äôs ruins. Surrounded by a desert of black sand and dead rocks. Abigail fell in love with her new home. The corpse of her long-dead planet, devoid of all life. She was the last one. The last thing. A sole remnant still aware inside a lifeless and decaying universe.

Abigail breathed every last bit of the air of desolation that surrounded her with sheer excitement. She had achieved her goal of absolution. She reached her dreamland of cosmic isolation.

Falling to the ground, Abigail had realized just dark the night‚Äôs sky was. Most of the stars had died and fallen into the jaws of Mot while she was dancing her dance of the void. There was barely any light visible left.

Abigail laughed and said to no one in particular, ‚ÄúDancing for eons was worth it.‚Äù",libraryofshadows,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/pc8v71/black_dancer/,Sci-Fi,BloodySpaghetti,pc8v71,/r/libraryofshadows/comments/pc8v71/black_dancer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/pc8v71/black_dancer/,0,2021-08-26

The deepest massage she has ever received...,"***""Deep Massage"" by Clit Club***  
*(This is a preview of a short erotic story that you can currently read for FREE on Kindle here:*  
[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DBSXJPX](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DBSXJPX)*)*

**1**  
I typically get through my day by relying heavily on spontaneity. My husband would say this was due to my lack of planning, but I‚Äôd say it was to keep my schedule as open as I can. Today, however, I was thoroughly thankful for my early morning decision to book a massage for myself this evening. I had been sent out of state for business, and my company had set me up in a rather nice hotel room for the two weeks I‚Äôd be staying. I was surprised when I learned they had complimentary massages for those of us staying on business.   
How could I possibly say no to a free massage?  
The doorman at the hotel greeted me with a smile and welcomed me back as he opened the door. I returned his smile with a nod and a ‚Äòthank you‚Äô before heading towards the elevator. I was eager to take off the low heels that had seemed like a good idea this morning. As the elevator doors closed, I glanced at my watch to see just how late in the afternoon it was. My massage was scheduled for 5:30, and it would be nice to have time to shower before going down to the spa. My watch read 4:37 pm. Great. I was cutting it closer than I‚Äôd like, but I could manage.   
When the chime of the elevator signaled that I had reached my floor, I had already started loosening the silk scarf around my neck to save me some time. My feet ached as I approached my door, but with the swipe of a card, I was greeted by a gust of cool air when I entered my room. I must have left the AC on earlier.   
I immediately noticed that housekeeping had been in to do their work. The bed had been made and fresh towels supplied. But I was surprised to find a cart had been left behind along with a portable massage table. When I had scheduled the massage, I assumed I would have to go downstairs for my appointment. It was a pleasant surprise to say the least to know I‚Äôd be able to relax in the comfort of my room.  
I immediately took off my shoes and started to unbutton my blouse. After the day I‚Äôd had, I desperately needed a shower to wash the stress away.   
A knock at my door stopped me in my tracks. The masseuse couldn‚Äôt be here already! I glanced at my watch again. It was only 4:40. Who could it be?  
I pinched my now unbuttoned blouse closed as I went to greet my surprise guest.   
‚ÄúYes?‚Äù I asked softly as I peeked through the cracked door. I hid my partially dressed body behind the door out of modesty. Imagine my surprise when I found a rather handsome young man waiting for me on the other side.   
‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù he said with a smile. ‚ÄúI am a bit early. You requested a massage, yes?‚Äù   
**2**  
His short-sleeved shirt hugged his torso tightly, giving me an ample view of just how toned his chest was. His biceps bulged under the confines of his sleeves. It was apparent that he had enough upper body strength to crack me like a glow stick if he chose to. I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt a little nervous to have him as a masseuse.   
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam?‚Äù he asked softly and with a little laugh.   
Oh jeez. He‚Äôd caught me staring, hadn‚Äôt he? I immediately snapped my attention to his face as if I wasn‚Äôt just gawking at him like a piece of cake in a dessert window. However, the second I met his kind gaze, all my anxieties melted away. His eyes were gentle as he looked down at me, waiting for my response.   
‚ÄúY-yes! Yes, that was me,‚Äù I said with a laugh of my own. I stepped back and opened the door wide enough for him to enter. ‚ÄúPlease, come in.‚Äù   
He did as instructed, but as I closed the door behind him, his eyes lingered on my partially covered chest.   
‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI was just about to take a shower before you arrived.‚Äù   
‚ÄúBy all means,‚Äù he said, his eyes lingering on my cleavage for a moment longer, ‚Äútake all the time you need. I‚Äôll be right here when you want me.‚Äù   
Did he just wink at me? No, of course not. I must be seeing things.  
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be just a moment,‚Äù I responded with a polite smile before slipping into the safety of the bathroom. I fanned myself to cool down the heat that was rising in my cheeks. There was something about the way he looked at me that made my heart rate skyrocket. It felt like he was undressing me with his eyes. It had been an awful long time since someone other than my husband had looked at me like that.   
As terrible as it was, my mind was consumed by thoughts of this masseuse as I slipped into the shower.  
I didn‚Äôt even know his name.  
**3**  
With my mind cleared and my body modestly wrapped in a towel, I stepped out of the bathroom. Just as he promised, the masseuse stood next to the cart which was filled with different oils, rocks, and assorted tools of his trade.   
‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he motioned towards the massage table, ‚Äúmake yourself comfortable.‚Äù He then politely turned his back to me to allow me some privacy.   
I let the towel drop to my ankles before lying down on the table. It took a little awkward maneuvering, but I managed to drape the small modesty towel provided across my bum so I wasn‚Äôt so exposed.   
‚ÄúReady when you are,‚Äù I announced.   
He turned around with a soft chuckle. Initially I was a little nervous to be practically nude in front of a total stranger, but the way he smiled and spoke so comfortably helped calm my nerves.  
‚ÄúIs this your first time?‚Äù he asked softly as he let his hands gently glide along my back before adjusting the towel to cover me more properly.   
‚ÄúIs it that obvious?‚Äù I responded with a nervous laugh.  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù I felt the warmth of the body oil drizzle across my shoulder blades and then down my spine. His hands followed in the wake, coating every inch of my skin with a slick lubricant. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take good care of you.‚Äù   
His velvety voice sent tingles straight down to my toes. And when his thumbs pressed along either side of my spine, I couldn‚Äôt help the soft hum that vibrated past my lips. I tried to hold back, but his hands felt like magic against my sore muscles. He rubbed deep, tight circles in my lower back, eliciting another moan from me.   
‚ÄúMy my,‚Äù he teased as he focused more pressure a little higher up on my back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so tight.‚Äù His comment sent heat straight to my core. What did he just say to me?   
‚ÄúYour muscles are so tense,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou must‚Äôve had a long day at the office.‚Äù   
‚ÄúYou have no idea.‚Äù  
**4**  
I had begun to relax a bit, but my muscles tensed when he moved his attention to the backs of my thighs. I silently prayed that he didn‚Äôt notice as he began to run the oil into my skin there.   
‚ÄúIs this too much pressure?‚Äù he asked as his fingers pressed firmly into the flesh of my thighs. It was slightly ticklish for some reason, but the way he worked my muscles felt heavenly.  
‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù   
‚ÄúGood.‚Äù His voice was just above a whisper as his hands trailed down the back of my legs and across my calves. With my body fully slicked with oil, he pushed his way back up to my thighs. I tried to keep myself from squirming under his touch, but the way his hands inched higher and higher on my thigh made it hard to resist.   
I didn‚Äôt want to admit it to myself, but I was getting turned on by how sensually his fingers caressed my sensitive skin. I had to take a deep breath to calm myself down. I didn‚Äôt want to get carried away. I thought of my husband who was waiting for me back at home to ground myself back in reality.  
Despite my efforts, I almost whined in protest when his hands stilled.   
‚ÄúIs it alright if I go higher?‚Äù he asked. His fingers patiently waited for my response.   
‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I replied, not really sure what I was consenting to.   
True to his word, his massage went higher up my thigh, just underneath the curve of my ass. He squeezed the softer flesh and I could feel the way it made my cheeks jiggle. I couldn‚Äôt help the fire that burned in my core as he seemingly toyed with me. Was this typical practice? It felt way too sexual to be considered professional, but there was no way in hell I was going to tell him to stop.   
His hands worked high up on my inner thighs. He was so close to my pussy, I could feel the heat radiating off of his fingers.   
My heart froze within my chest as one of his fingers just barely grazed against the lips of my pussy. I must have jolted slightly at the contact.   
‚ÄúSensitive, are we?‚Äù he said, sensually purring the question and further inflaming me.

The Magic Of Television,"My grandpa Chuck is a Baby Boomer, and without a doubt, the most quintessentially Boomer thing my grandpa does is maintain a ‚Äòdisplay room‚Äô. It‚Äôs basically a second living room, except instead of IKEA, it‚Äôs filled with artisanal, luxury European furnishings, which no one is allowed to lay a finger on. There are China cabinets, filled with multiple sets of fine China, that have never once been used. All manner of collectibles decorate every surface, and the only time they‚Äôve ever been moved since they‚Äôve been in that room is when my grandpa cleans the place. There‚Äôs even an antique piano, even though he couldn‚Äôt play chopsticks if his life depended on it.  

It‚Äôs just a whole room filled with the most expensive things my grandfather could afford, treated as sacred cows of consumerism, none of which he dares to get any practical use out of. It‚Äôs not that weird, not for a Boomer anyway, but what is weird is that he keeps a television in there too. No one‚Äôs supposed to be in that room, and I always thought that putting a television in there would just encourage people to use it. It‚Äôs not a big TV either, and as far as I know, the only thing that really makes TVs expensive is their size. I did ask my grandpa about it once, about why it deserved a place in his display room, and all he would say was that ‚Äòthey don‚Äôt make ‚Äôem like that, anymore‚Äô. 

Late last year, before vaccines were available here, grandpa caught Covid and was in the hospital for a little while, and asked if I could housesit for him. He was slowly dying of coronavirus, and his number one concern was that his stuff was okay. Pure Boomer energy there. Regardless of what I thought of his priorities, I agreed so that he wouldn‚Äôt be worried and could focus on getting better. He wrote down a rather extensive list of rules for what to do and what not to do, some of which were exasperatingly neurotic but not really out of the ordinary. 

That is, until it came to the television in the display room. Here‚Äôs what he wrote for it. 

1. When cleaning the display room, do not touch the television set, except for any of the reasons listed below. 

2. If the cabinet doors are open, close them immediately.

3. When the television is off, do not look at your reflection on the screen. 

4. Don‚Äôt sit too close to the television, on or off. 

5. If the television is on, turn it off immediately, and remember that TV isn‚Äôt real.

6. When it‚Äôs on, be careful not to bring your hand close enough to feel static on the screen. 

7. If it doesn‚Äôt turn off, leave the house immediately, and call me. Don‚Äôt try to unplug it. 

8. **Never** change the channel. 

9.  If you fail to follow these rules and there‚Äôs an incident with the television, **do not** destroy it. **He** doesn‚Äôt make them like that anymore.  

I honestly wasn't all that concerned by this. My grandpa knew I was curious about his mysterious old television set, and I figured he was just messing with me. I had been in his house lots of times before, and I had no reason to believe that the television was dangerous or supernatural in any way. 

I settled into my grandpa‚Äôs house, and went straight to work attending to his lengthy list of instructions. It was mostly yard work, even though there was no garden; just a large crop of homogenous grass under the vigilant gaze of ceramic gnomes and plastic flamingos, all of which he was inordinately proud of. Any weed or wildflower that dared to rear its nonconforming head was living on borrowed time, and if any of his neighbour‚Äôs creeping ivy got onto his side of the fence on my watch, there‚Äôd be hell to pay. 

Being busy and outdoors most of the day, it wasn‚Äôt until I was eating my dinner that evening that I noticed it; the sound of electric static. I didn‚Äôt notice it all at once. It was more of a gradual awareness that I was hearing a very faint white noise that I couldn‚Äôt account for. I silenced every appliance or electronics that I could to listen for it, and I realized that it was television static. 

I followed the sound into the hallway, and in the gap between the display room‚Äôs door and the floor, I could see the flickering light of a television set. 

I was momentarily unsettled by this revelation, since it was an old clunker of a television that shouldn‚Äôt have been able to turn itself on. I quickly dismissed the thought as irrational though. My grandpa must have left it on before he went into the hospital, either by accident or on purpose just to mess with me, and both the sound and the light had been too faint for me to notice before. 

Remembering his list of rules regarding that television, and fully aware there might be some kind of a prank waiting for me inside, I cautiously opened the door and stepped into the cherished room of expensive and useless junk. 

It was as immaculate as I remembered it, seemingly not a single item having been moved since the last time I was there. The entire room was bathed in nothing but the monochromatic flickering from the staticky television, which made everything seem about ten times creepier than it did in the light of day.

The only lamp in the room wasn‚Äôt plugged into the correct socket for the light switch to work, so I didn‚Äôt bother trying to turn it on. I figured I would turn off the TV, and then use the light on my phone to see my way out. Since I saw no evidence of any booby traps that my grandpa might have laid for me, I headed towards the television, diligently watching my step as I did so. 

The cabinet doors were wide open, which was weird in and of itself, as my grandfather always kept them shut. I was supposed to shut them too, after turning the TV off, but I couldn‚Äôt help but take a moment to examine it while I had the chance. 

It looked like a classic 1950‚Äôs television set, with a wooden box frame, bulging glass screen, and knobs for control. But right below the screen, in shiny brass letters, were the words ‚ÄòIn Glorious Retrovision‚Ñ¢‚Äô. This was confusing to me, since that implied it was a recreation. I saw that there was a framed letter hanging on the inside of the cabinet door, and while it was hard to read in the dim and inconsistent light, I was able to make out that it was a Letter of Certification. 

It stated that the television in question was a genuine In Glorious Retrovision‚Ñ¢, made by an individual called Volodya Dragovic, followed by some nonsense about it using special crystals for transceiving waves in the Panpsychic Aether. 

So that's what made it special then? It was a joke? Some sort of uncharacteristic meta-commentary on the room itself by my grandfather? I shook my head in confusion, and reached down to turn the television off. 

I jolted my hand back when I saw a face in the static staring back at me. 

‚ÄúHey there, ducky!‚Äù the face grinned. It looked like a young woman‚Äôs face, her dark hair worn in girlish bunches, her smile equal parts sweet and sinister. 

I shrieked at the sight of her, stepping backwards and slamming the cabinet doors shut as I did so. I was left in almost complete darkness at that point, the only light being whatever flickering static managed to seep through the cracks in the cabinet door.

‚ÄúNow that wasn‚Äôt very nice,‚Äù the girl chastised me, pouting a little as she did so. ‚ÄúI just wanted to say hi. Is this your first time using an In Glorious Retrovision‚Ñ¢? I‚Äôve never seen you on here before.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou, you can see me through the television?‚Äù I stammered. I hadn‚Äôt noticed any sort of camera built-in or connected to the television set. 

‚ÄúOf course, ducky. It‚Äôs like a telescreen from Nineteen Eight-Four,‚Äù the girl replied. ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Mary, by the way. Mary Darling. What‚Äôs yours?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ Chris,‚Äù I answered, hoping that that would be sufficient. 

‚ÄúHello Chris, a pleasure to meet you,"" she said sweetly. ""Would you mind opening the cabinet doors so that I can see you? My brother's out, and I‚Äôm *sooo* bored. I just want to talk to somebody.‚Äù

I froze, unsure of what I should do. My grandfather‚Äôs list made it very clear that I should shut the television off immediately. But this girl, if that‚Äôs even what she was, had taken notice of me, and I was getting an extremely strong vibe that she was not someone I wanted to offend. 

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ yeah, sure. No problem. Sorry I slammed them shut on you like that. You startled me, is all,‚Äù I said unconvincingly as I slowly pulled open the cabinet doors to reveal her smirking, staticky face. 

‚ÄúYeah, I tend to startle people a lot,‚Äù she said, playfully twirling her right pigtail. ‚ÄúThis is Chuck‚Äôs Retrovision‚Ñ¢, right? How do you know him?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAh, he‚Äôs my grandpa, actually,‚Äù I blurted, immediately regretting it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre friends with him, I take it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not exactly. He usually tunes out the instant he sees I‚Äôve tuned in,‚Äù she admitted. ‚ÄúBut I manage to catch him off guard every now and then, though.‚Äù 

 I swallowed nervously, wondering what it was about this strange girl that had made my grandfather so diligently avoid her. I glanced down at the television set, looking for the power button. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that, ducky,‚Äù she said, except this time her voice came from behind me and was free of any static distortion. I spun around and saw her sitting on the couch, lit by the glow from the accursed television. Her hair was pitch black, her eyes baby blue, and her silk bathrobe, lipstick, and nail polish were all bright red. She held a cherry-garnished martini in one hand, a cigarette in the other, and tucked into the sash of her robe were several gleaming kitchen knives which became orders of magnitude more frightening just through association with her. 

I couldn‚Äôt process how she had gotten there. It seemed impossible, but since she wasn‚Äôt acting hostile at the moment, I was more dumbfounded than terrified, though I was still plenty terrified. 

‚ÄúHow, how did you, how did you get here?‚Äù I stammered.

‚ÄúMmmm. I‚Äôm not. This is just a projection. You‚Äôre perfectly safe, ducky,‚Äù she said as she took a sip of her martini. ‚ÄúNo, I never leave my playroom without my brother James. A woman‚Äôs place is in the home, especially when that home is an extradimensional pocket of spacetime that she can bend to her every whim. James goes out on his own when we need new playthings or other supplies, and he enjoys the challenges working within this reality poses. Me though, I prefer being perpetually drunk on the sense of god-like, nigh-omnipotence I get from ruling our playroom. I get bored when he‚Äôs out though, like I said, so I play around with the Retrovision‚Ñ¢, see who‚Äôs watching. Come, sit beside me, and I‚Äôll show you how this thing works!‚Äù 

I couldn‚Äôt smell her cigarette at all, which seemed to corroborate her claim that she wasn‚Äôt really there. That meant that I was safe for the moment, it seemed. It also meant that I could run away, but that seemed likely to upset her and might end up biting me in the ass down the line. Humouring her seemed like the least risky thing to do, so I politely sat beside her. 

‚ÄúAh, you said that you just being a projection meant I was safe. Why wouldn‚Äôt I be safe if you were really here?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look that dangerous.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs kind of the point. If I was a grotesque monster instead of a pretty girl, you‚Äôd probably had done the smart thing and ran out of here as fast as you could,‚Äù she grinned at me. ‚ÄúBut, since you asked, I‚Äôm actually a cannibalistic serial killer, as clich√© as that sounds.‚Äù 

I chuckled as affably as I could, only for her to take a drag from her cigarette as she glared at me in disdain.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not joking,‚Äù she said coldly. ‚ÄúBetween us, my brother and I kill at least dozens of people every year, and I haven't gone a day without eating human flesh since I was a kid. I‚Äôve always got bits of someone else in my intestines, since I use it in all my cooking. When I was young, I even served it to my parents. I told them I got the meat from Home Economics class, and when I killed my parents, I served some of them to my Home Economics class and told them I got the meat from home! And it‚Äôs not just fun; it‚Äôs healthy too! A human body has everything the human body needs. You just have to avoid the brain because of the prions. And my cannibalism is purely culinary, by the way. I have no respect for survival cannibalism. I don‚Äôt abandon *my* principles when things get rough. I‚Äôm sorry, I can see you‚Äôre sick of me shoving my lifestyle down your throat. It‚Äôs a shame I‚Äôm not really here, because then I could literally shove my cooking down your throat! Oh well. Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs on TV.‚Äù

She set down her martini and pulled out an old-fashioned remote from her robe.

‚ÄúAh, my grandpa said not to change the channel,‚Äù I protested weakly, knowing it would be useless. 

‚ÄúOh, he left you some rules for this, did he?‚Äù she asked as she threw her head back in laughter. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm not big on rules.‚Äù 

With a click of a button, the static-filled screen changed into a monochromatic scene of what looked like an occult office or study. There were gothic bookshelves, a big and ornate desk with a leather chair, and a multitude of antique chests stacked around the room. 

‚ÄúBe very quiet,‚Äù she whispered to me with a mischievous smile. ‚ÄúSince I‚Äôm using your Retrovision‚Ñ¢, he won‚Äôt know it‚Äôs me right away.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe hell I won‚Äôt, Darling! You think I can‚Äôt recognize that eldritch aura of yours on a different frequency?‚Äù a cantankerous old man shouted from somewhere off-screen. ‚ÄúStay off my psi waves, or so help me, I will personally see to it that you end up crammed into the same floating box as your Uncle Larry!‚Äù  

A dark form briefly moved in front of the screen before it went back to static. 

‚ÄúHmm. Alright, I guess that‚Äôs not going to work,‚Äù she said, disappointed but not upset. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay though. There are things besides other Retrovisions‚Ñ¢ putting out strong enough signals that this can pick up.‚Äù

She started flipping through the channels rapidly, most of them containing nothing but more static. A few of them contained semi-coherent images and half-audible sounds, but she never stayed on those long enough for me to get a good grasp of what they actually were. It wasn't until she found her first clear image that something seemed to grab her attention. 

There on the screen was a hooded, hunchback figure perched atop some stone ruins like a gargoyle, leaning on a strange shepherd‚Äôs crook. Its head looked vaguely like the skull of an elephant or a mammoth, with a singular, cyclopean orifice in the front. The orifice held a small glowing light deep with its abyssal darkness, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was supposed to be a mouth, an airway, a sensory organ, or all three. 

Beneath the orifice was a pair of long, tentacle-like appendages that fell to nearly the creature‚Äôs waist. Pairs of spiracles and wispy tendrils ran all along their tapering length until they each ended in a sharp, hooked talon. The creature‚Äôs fingers, clawed and twice as long as they would be on a human, numbered exactly seven; four on the right hand and three on the left, the slender extra digit appearing to be a specialized and possibly vestigial appendage. Its feet were digitigrade, almost velociraptor-like, and it seemed like there was at least one more tentacle, or possibly a tail, hiding under its robes. But other than that, it was humanoid. 

Despite that, something about it was deeply unsettling. Deeply aberrant. Deeply wrong. 

‚ÄúFinally; something good!‚Äù Mary squeed in delight. 

‚ÄúIs that thing real?‚Äù I asked her, still unsure of how the RetrovisionTM was supposed to work. 

‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs not from this reality, so arguably no,‚Äù she smiled. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a wanderer, a planeswalker; he‚Äôs from another level of existence altogether. I can tell from his aura.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean it‚Äôs an alien?‚Äù I asked skeptically.

‚ÄúAn extra-dimensional alien, yes, but I‚Äôve never seen his kind before,‚Äù she nodded. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe me, do you?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, I mean, what makes you think it‚Äôs not just a guy in a suit, or an animatronic, or CGI?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt exactly look out of place on the set of a sci-fi movie.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI told you, I can tell from his aura that he‚Äôs not from this plane,‚Äù she insisted. ‚ÄúBut, if for some reason the word of a cannibalistic serial killer isn‚Äôt good enough for you, why don‚Äôt you go in for a closer look? These screens having surprisingly good resolution.‚Äù 

Her tone made it clear that her suggestion was actually an order, so I obediently got up and cautiously approached the television. Up close, I could see that the creature wore a leather vambrace on its left arm, with three glowing, hemispherical dials on it, along with various other clockwork accoutrements. A belt around its waist bore a similar design, and its robes had been spun from a strange sort of silk with angular fractals embroidered into them. 

Such fine, if odd, garments upon so monstrous a creature were part of what made it so unsettling. Its inhuman ‚Äì no, *unearthly* ‚Äì anatomy marked it as something utterly alien, but it had clad itself in what I could recognize as the trappings of both civilization and erudition. 

It stood oddly still, silently peering out into the night around it, like an ambush predator waiting in silence for prey to walk by. I couldn‚Äôt see much other than the creature itself, but from what I could tell, it was alone and no one else had noticed it yet. I studied its skin closely, trying to discern if it was a silicone or digital illusion, but as far as I could tell, it looked like living cephalopod skin to me. I peered in closer and closer, bringing my face so close to the screen that I could feel its strong static field on my nose. 

That‚Äôs when the creature jolted its head towards me, the glowing dot in its orifice darting around like the lure of an angler fish. 

I pulled back from the screen so quickly that I toppled backwards, landing halfway on the couch, where Mary was laughing hysterically. 

‚ÄúOh my god. Did it see me? Did it see me?‚Äù I screamed. Before she could answer, there was a tapping at the window. We both turned to see the creature standing outside, drumming at the glass with one of its clawed tentacles. 

I bolted for the door, but when I threw it open the creature had translocated again and was blocking my path, this time with both its mouth tentacles arched upwards like two cobras poised to strike. Even with its hunched posture, it was just barely shorter than the doorframe, and I had no chance of muscling past it. My only way to escape was breaking through the window, but what good would that do against a being that could teleport? I didn't dare to fight it either, so instead, I just fell flat on my ass and begged for my life.

""I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I wasn't looking for you! I don't even know what you are! I wouldn't know how to find you again if I had to! She was the one who did it! If you're worried about being found again, take her, please! I'm no threat to you!"" 

‚ÄúI love it when they beg,‚Äù Mary chortled as she ate the cherry from her martini. ‚ÄúAlmost as much as I love a good snuff film. Strangle him with those snake arms of yours and gut him like a fish!‚Äù 

At that moment, I had no reason to believe that the creature could understand either of us. It looked down at me, then up at Mary, and then over to the old television set. It tapped a claw to the device on its wrist, and the channel changed to show Mary sitting in her living room, her gleefully sadistic expression instantly turning to one of dismay. 

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!‚Äù she cursed as she fumbled with the remote. The projection of her vanished immediately, but she seemed to be having some trouble turning her own Retrovision off. The strange creature looked down at me one last time, its orifice and tentacles somehow forming an expression that I read as a kindly smile.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs outrageous what they allow on TV these days,‚Äù it remarked in an echoey, dead-pan voice, which may have just been in my head. 

The creature teleported again, this time reappearing on the television with Mary. She shouted and pulled out her knives, but the creature dodged her blows and grabbed her arms in its tentacles. The walls of the room they were in began to melt, and then‚Ä¶ I turned off the TV. It was pitch black in the room, but in the screen‚Äôs dull afterglow, I could just make out my reflection. Deciding I should follow at least one of my grandpa‚Äôs rules, I slammed the cabinet doors shut before the image could register in my brain and I got the hell out of there. 

I don‚Äôt know what happened between Mary and that creature, and so long as I never see either of them again, I don‚Äôt care. I called my grandfather, told him what happened and that I couldn‚Äôt stay in that house anymore. Fortunately, he was understanding, but not exactly forthcoming on anything he knew about what I had been through. 

When he got out of the hospital, the first thing he did was check on his display room. Nothing was broken or missing or even out of place, with one exception; a kitchen knife was embedded into the couch, exactly where I had been sitting. It looked like it had been thrown straight from the television; or, as impossible as it sounds, through it. 

Mary had tried to kill me at some point, it seems, even from the other side of the screen. She had missed her shot and I, mesmerized by what I saw on the TV screen, failed to notice.   

Small wonder then that my grandfather always keeps the TV cabinet [doors](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/) [closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/).",SignalHorrorFiction,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SignalHorrorFiction/comments/pc8mgv/the_magic_of_television/,,A_Vespertine,pc8mgv,/r/SignalHorrorFiction/comments/pc8mgv/the_magic_of_television/,https://www.reddit.com/r/SignalHorrorFiction/comments/pc8mgv/the_magic_of_television/,0,2021-08-26

Mother Knows Best,"She had been ignoring the letters.  Once a week, twice a week, and then almost every day she saw the letters she was getting.  Camp had no internet access, no phone wires, and mortals couldn't use Iris messaging.  Letters was the only way Kenzie's mother could get in touch with her.  But the entire pile of them remained unanswered in her desk drawer.

There was no doubt in her mind what all of this was about.  Originally when she begged her mother to come back to Camp Half Blood and get a break from her modelling work, her mother said two months and no more than that.  But Kenzie did *not* send an Iris message to let her know that she was coming home.  In face she'd spent five months nearly at camp so far.

She wasn't sure if she wanted to go back to her old life.  She wasn't sure if she wanted to wake up at four in the morning to go through an hour of hair and make up and pose for photos for the rest of the day.  If she wanted to fly around half the time and never see anyone she cared about.  Kenzie loved fashion but she also loved just being allowed to be a seventeen year old girl.

It was finally time to bite the bullet and actually talk to her mom.  The letters were coming quickly and now she was worried that her mother would get their driver to take her all the way to Long Island Sound and pace outside of the barrier until she found someone to harass about Kenzie's behavior.  Even worse than that she was bold enough to get the police involved if she needed to.

So in the early hours of the afternoon while everyone was off at their lessons, Kenzie took her phone and slipped out of her cabin.  She took the well worn trail outside of camp until she was standing directly outside of the barrier.  This part made her nervous.  Not afraid of any monsters that might be attracted to her using her phone but afraid of what her mother might say.

Kenzie pressed the numbers on the touch screen in an order that she knew by heart and placed the phone to her ear.  She didn't have to wait long for the person on the other side to pick up.

""MACKENZIE DEERE,"" she heard her mother screech, a loud sound that held equal parts worry and annoyance.

""Are you alright?  You haven't Iris messaged me, you never replied to a single one of my letters.  You said you weren't going to stay at camp for more than two months and it's already been half a year.  I thought something may have happened to you.""

Kenzie mumbled a response.  ""I'm fine mom.  Nothing's happened to me.  I just like it here at camp.""

Silence.  A particularly long and painful silence.

""Mackenzie you're not telling me you're staying there?  After you said you were only visiting?  When you have a whole modelling career ahead of you?  Do you know how many gigs your agent and I had to decline?""

Kenzie could feel her nervousness, her anxiety growing in the pit of her stomach.  Any time she talked to her mother it was like this.  A sinking feeling that she could never do anything right.

""No mom, two months was your idea.  I'm...I'm happy here.  I don't know if I want to go back to what I was doing before.  I like being a model but I want to be a kid too.""

The yelling that followed was too loud for Kenzie to pick out much but she heard the words 'I know best' somewhere in there followed by 'How could you do this after everything I've done for you'.  She didn't want to hear it anymore.  Kenzie took the phone away from her ear and ended the call.

There was still a deep unease within her.  She didn't know if she made the right decision, or how long she could go until she caved in.  But for now at least, she could focus on the people that really cared about her.  And as her phone started ringing again, she let it fall to the ground and walked back inside the barrier, back to Camp Half Blood.

This is for my own benefit of my doubts.,"

So yet another minor argument between me and my partner of almost 2 years just went down. I love him dearly. We‚Äôre young, in our early 20‚Äôs, so of course we both aren‚Äôt fully matured yet, but one thing really does stand out to me. When we argue, I always feel as if I‚Äôm never truly heard. Of course I always say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not listening to me‚Äù or ‚Äúyou just don‚Äôt understand‚Äù in spite of how I feel in the moment. I completely regret saying that after the fact because he does listen. The kicker is that he doesn‚Äôt ever take responsibility and only hears me in ways that make him seem wrong or invalid. He can never just listen, accept, and apologize for how he made me feel. He can never NOT rebuttal. I can never express my opinion without being interrupted by his conflicting point of view. It‚Äôs always ‚Äúwell you‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúno you‚Ä¶‚Äù etc. Anytime we argue I always feel as if I‚Äôm wrong or even crazy at times when I know deep down what really happened. Right now, it‚Äôs just minor little things, but it worries me how drastic this could be in the future if we don‚Äôt resolve this issue now. I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened tonight. I need some sort of opinion especially after hours of research into this idea of falling victim to ‚Äúgaslighting‚Äù. 

Tonight I made dinner for my boyfriend, his dad, and I. I had no problem doing so. He helped me chop some of the ingredients, but I did most of the work, again completely fine by me. I also had intentions to make cookies. I planned to simultaneously make them while I cleaned up after dinner. My boyfriends sister also came to drop of his dads dog and visit. 
Now at that point, after dinner, I was starting to wonder if my boyfriend would offer to help me cleanup or even just start helping out spontaneously. No, he did not but that was still ok. I never expect anything from anyone, but I appreciate the idea. Of course I was a little sad and disappointed but no where near the point of being mad or distraught over it. Eventually his dad helped me clean up and I thanked him because I appreciated his generosity. By the time everything was cleaned up and almost done, my boyfriend asked if I needed any help. It was definitely frustrating to me because everything was already done, and I didn‚Äôt need help at that point, but I politely declined and continued to bake and finish up the kitchen. 

After I put the cookies in the oven, I went to use the restroom. Keep in mind we‚Äôre in a very small apartment so using the restroom directly across from the seating area makes it very easy to hear conversations. I overheard my boyfriend talking about my behavior to his sister. He whispered loudly ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs mad at me. I offered to help and she said no, like what the f‚Ä¶?‚Äù His tone was like he was seeking validation of his interpretation for how I felt. I‚Äôm no psychologist, but his sister probably agreed with a simple ‚Äúyeah‚Äù because she really did not care about a small ordeal as such. In his mind that later would become all the evidence he‚Äôd need to validate his point of view in our later argument.

I resumed finishing my tasks in the kitchen, but at this point in the story I was mad. All could think about was how badly I wanted to point out the fact that I heard him talking about me behind my back. 
Finally his sister left and I said ‚ÄúI heard you talking about me in the bathroom‚Äù he denied what I said and replied ‚Äúno? What are you talking about?‚Äù It‚Äôs common for him to confuse my feelings. He generally assumes I am always mad. Everything I say seems like a personal attack toward him. It makes it very difficult to communicate when our feelings are conflicting. But after years of small arguments I try so hard to keep calm. I want to do my best to see his point of view but it‚Äôs never accurate. It‚Äôs always in his favor. He claimed that he offered to help right after dinner before his dad started to help me voluntarily. Here is where my side of the argument comes into play: Why would I be mad if that had happened. I was already sad about that so of course I would have accepted that offer and none of this would have happened in the first place. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but isn‚Äôt that logical? This is where I feel as if I really am a victim. Because from that point on, the argument was nothing but him denying the facts and the painful implantation of insanity, hopelessness, and confusion within my head leading me to endless tears and wanting to go home. 

So where does this lead me? I‚Äôm not sure. Again, I love this man. I know he‚Äôs the one I want to marry but I can‚Äôt live the rest of my life having this negativity. I‚Äôve become very insecure with how I am. I often wonder if I‚Äôm crazy, if I‚Äôm delusional or even unstable. I just want to know the best way for us to work through this. I don‚Äôt blame him for anything, I only want to help us in the long run. 

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you and I hope I‚Äôve made sense of myself. 

P.s. this is the first time I‚Äôve documented my feelings and it was very calming and almost therapeutic.",gaslighting,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaslighting/comments/pbrdap/this_is_for_my_own_benefit_of_my_doubts/,,kassienol,pbrdap,/r/gaslighting/comments/pbrdap/this_is_for_my_own_benefit_of_my_doubts/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaslighting/comments/pbrdap/this_is_for_my_own_benefit_of_my_doubts/,1,2021-08-26
True story about my (32m) Girlfriend (30f) she confessed,"So my girlfriend Jamie and I have been together for several years.  Shes very attractive, IMO, 5'4 about 140 pounds, blonde hair, blue eyes... she's not got much of an ass, but has very nice 34c titties.

Anyway, Jamie about 2 years ago got a job as a manager for Abercrombie at the Mall.  She has her degree in English, but the job market has been slow and all of her real work experience has been in retail.   So after working there for maybe 6 months, one night she comes to my house after work and is bitching about this new girl at work.  ""Carrie"" it seems was 21 and a real bratty girl who just thought she was so much better than everyone else.  I should mention that Jamie herself is a bit bratty and Jamie is always the 'take charge' sort of person.  

So Jamie complained about Carrie that night, but what was remarkable was that Jamie mentioned it several times.  And she more than once mentioned how Carrie must have thought she was so great because she was so hot and sexy.   I asked Jamie about this after the second time she said it, because Jamie had always been kind of homophobic and not one to ever mention that this girl or that was hot.  And if I were to joke about her and another girl, Jamie would inevitably get pissed and shut that down.

So Jamie explained to me that Carrie was about her same height, but had an amazing butt and was in great shape and had perfect sized tits.  Jamie is in good shape IMHO, but she doesnt really work at it, so she has some jiggle (that I like).  But Jamie also mentioned how this girl was just STUNNING to look at in the face.  Jamie said she was model pretty.  But, that she was a brat and didnt really want to work hard.

So a couple of nights later she came home and I could tell something was up.  Jamie was just way up in her own head and very distracted and just not herself at all.   I asked her what was up and she said she didnt want to talk about it.  I tried to fool around and she wasnt having it that night.  So we went to bed.  After I was almost asleep she woke me up and told me that she needed to tell me something, and that I might be mad, but she was freaked out and didnt want to lie, but also didnt want to lose me.   I was confused and calmed her down and she basically told me this story

It seems that earlier in the evening, when she was in the back of the store on break, she was caught more than once staring at Carrie, by Carrie... with a bit of ""what are you looking at"" type attitude.  Jamie tried to ignore it and say nothing... but one of the last times, Carrie made a comment to her about 'if you are crushing on me, you should just admit it... i'd probably fuck you'

And this got into Jamie's head, because she couldnt explain it because she'd never had those thoughts about another girl... and this girl who was SO pretty and SO feminine... was coming on to her, and she as turned on by it  BUT, she is like almost 10 years younger than Jamie...but has the confidence of someone older.

So, at some point Carrie had gone to clean up the dressing rooms or something around closing time and since she was still new, Jamie had to clear the areas each girl was to clean up before they could clock out and leave.   Jamie went to check on Carrie and Carrie pulled her into a dressing room and pushed Jamie up to the wall and basically said ""I think you like me, but are afraid to tell me""... Jamie was like frozen but then Carrie kissed her.  Jamie said she couldnt help but moan out loud and Carrie laughed and said somehting like ""I knew it...""

Jamie then scrambled out to check on the other girl closing and make sure her areas were done.  The rule is that someone stays with the manager until they are done closing, so no one leaves by themself.  Jamie was going to have the other girl, Mina, stay with her.. but Carrie volunteered to stay so Mina could leave and Mina jumped at the chance.

After Mina left, Jamie went in the back to do some putting away of other stuff and Carrie followed her into the back and when Jamie noticed, Carrie said ""I need to show you something in the changing room"".   Jamie said it was like she was hypnotized and she just followed her in there without arguement.   Carrie then grabbed Jamie and they started making out hard.   Jamie had on a skirt, and Carrie pulled the skirt up and started fingering Jamie with her panties still on.   Jamie said she got weak-knee'd so Carrie had her sit on the little bench seat and Carrie got down on her knees and licked Jamie's pussy a little.   Carrie then removed Jamie's panties and said ""these are mine now"".

Jamie was so turned on as Carrie went down on her more, she said she would have just about done whatever she told her to do.  But Carrie fingered her a little more, and said something to the effect of ""I knew you'd be all about my pussy when I saw you staring at me"" and Jamie kind of snapped out of it.   

they both got up and Carrie told her that she was keeping Jamie's panties this time.  they locked up the store and Carrie gave Jamie a hug and a kiss on the cheek in the parking lot.   Jamie said it was so confusing but so hot that she rode from all the way to my house in silence hardly believing it happened.

She told me about it, and I was so very turned on that we fucked ALOT that night.  Jamie told me that the next time that she and Carrie worked together, they made out 3 times in the changing rooms, but that Carrie didnt go as far as before, but promised her a surprise if she'd wear a skirt again with a black thong.  SO, Jamie did.. and that time when they closed up they had a similar experience but this time after fingering Jamie, Carrie (who also wore a skirt this night) pushed Jamie down on her knees and made Jamie lick HER pussy... and then she even took a pic with her phone of Jamie licking her pussy that she said was her ""insurance in case Jamie tried to get her fired""... when they got done, Carrie made them trade panties... so Jamie wore this other girl's panties home (pink satin panties) (which again turned me on like crazy and we fucked alot that night).

this happened like 4 more times.  Each time Carrie took Jamie's panties and made her wear her panties home.   Then one day Carrie quit without any notice and never came back, just called in to say she wasn't coming in.   Jamie was very confused, but has never really gone with any other women.   It was a very very sexy couple of months there for a while.",SluttyConfessions,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/pbqs6v/true_story_about_my_32m_girlfriend_30f_she/,,SouthernDog13,pbqs6v,/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/pbqs6v/true_story_about_my_32m_girlfriend_30f_she/,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/pbqs6v/true_story_about_my_32m_girlfriend_30f_she/,1,2021-08-26

Various Fandoms [F4A playing M] [Discord],"Hey all! I've been wanting to explore some various ideas within different fandoms, so hopefully one of these will interest you! I am 20F from the UK and have been writing for seven years! My responses can vary in length but I aim for 5+ paragraphs where possible. I use OCs that are well developed and can mesh well into the universes and storylines of the below fandoms and each have their own flaws and areas for character development throughout the plots we create! I am looking for people to play canon characters against my OCs. I love having a large cast of characters as well to further broaden these stories, so side characters are also a must! Collaboration is key and I'm excited to creating stories with you! (The characters in bold are the ones I'm most interested in mainly writing against!) Romance is not a requirement, but for some characters it may be more natural than others! I am open to NSFW as well, within story limits and purposes! Again with the romance, NSFW content may just be more natural with some characters and parings rather than others. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. MCU

My most well developed OCs are from the MCU and I have lots of information on request! There are different eras I'd like to explore which call for different characters, so hopefully some of these interest you! 

* Captain America: The Winter Soldier and beyond. This could involve the fall of HYDRA in more detail, the HYDRA agents such as Brock Rumlow (Crossbones) or Jack Rollins having more of an effect on the characters or what Bucky or Steve or Sam were up to during the time from The Winter Soldier to Civil War! This would probably lead into Civil War, so it would be great crafting our own story around it! Characters involved in this area would be Steve Rogers, **Bucky Barnes** (lots of room for development and HYDRA plots with this one!), Sam Wilson
* The Falcon and the Winter Soldier ‚Äì I loved this series a lot and would love to explore it and maybe even extend the story a little? We could go into depth in Madripoor and the crime around it or the Flagsmashers and approach more of the conflict between John Walker and the government / Sam and Bucky and see where else we could go! Characters involved here would be **Bucky Barnes**, Sam Wilson, **Zemo.** I think all the characters in this show are so intriguing and interesting, it would be fun to explore!
* More of a niche one, but 1960s/70s S.H.I.E.L.D! This had Hank Pym just developing the particles and he is such an interesting character! We could have classic Ant-Man villains translated into our own area of MCU, HYDRA agents trying to steal the particles and general MCU ""bad guys"" getting in the way! As this hasn't really been looked at in MCU before, it would pretty much be our own story! The main character here would be **Hank Pym** but side characters would include Peggy Carter and Howard Stark as well!
* Spider-Man. With the release of the No Way Home trailer I've been wanting even more MCU Peter Parker content! Although not my favourite Peter, I do love the way MCU has made him into the perfect awkward teenager. We could go through Homecoming and Far From Home, maybe involve some new villains for him to face as well? All the while dealing with typical high school drama! Characters would (obviously) be **Peter Parker** but side characters can be Tony Stark, Ned Leeds, MJ, Flash Thompson and pretty much everyone else in the Spider-Man films!

&amp;#x200B;

2. X-Men (Fox)

* The Fox X-Men films jump forward a decade each film, so this gives us a *lot* of time to work with! We could use any settings from the films (apart from Dark Phoenix because I really didn't like that one, lol) although preferably First Class or Days of Future Past. I've got an OC I'd love to use, and we could show her and the character who I'm writing against's character development as they embrace their mutation for the better! Characters I'd like to write against for this one are **Charles Xavier**, **Hank McCoy** and Erik Lehnsherr. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Stranger Things

* Stranger Things is one of my favourite series and I have a developed OC and her family I'd love to write in! As a high school student, she already has a lot to deal with as well as the threat of the inevitable Upside Down. As each season goes forwards a year, we would have lots of creative freedom with it as well! Characters I would like to write against are **Jonathan Byers** and **Steve Harrington**. And again, we've got lots of side characters to use as well!

&amp;#x200B;

4. Pirates of the Caribbean 

* Set during the first three films, I have an OC I'd like to use here as well! We can write our character's developments in themselves, their personalities, strengths and relationships throughout all the craziness of the films. As well as having a lot of unique characters alongside them such as the crew and of course all the villains! Characters I would like to write against for this one are **Will Turner** and Jack Sparrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

5. Lord of the Rings

* I have a basic plot set out for this one, so all you have to do is ask! Set after the Return of the King, it would follow an OC and her journey of exploration and development whilst trying to get away from an overbearing father. We can include long quests and journeys, occasional villains and anything else we can think of! The character I would like to write against for this is **Legolas**.



I hope this has interested at least some of you, and I can't wait to hear back! :)",RoleplayPartnerSearch,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/pcazq9/various_fandoms_f4a_playing_m_discord/,F4A,Cautious-Ad-8466,pcazq9,/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/pcazq9/various_fandoms_f4a_playing_m_discord/,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/pcazq9/various_fandoms_f4a_playing_m_discord/,0,2021-08-26
10. 'On The Neven'.,"10. 'On The Neven'.

Andrew/Drew Thomlinson, was in all actual fact, the real target of Avem Swarma.

However, Avem Swarma didn't yet know that. She was looking for Fu, while entirely distracted by her unfinished business with Eldritch Spellbound, who, in being not dead from her previous attempt to drone him out with bugs when she stole his ring, left Fu with the better part of his own soul, regardless of her (Avem's), prior summoning at Fu's birth.

Fu and Ralph Dizzmith, had looked for Andrei Spelling, but he had disappeared.

They had looked, because of Ralph's let on, of Andrei Spelling, being the next potential, ""Eldritch Spellbound.""

Eldritch Spellbound's reincarnation was actually Andrew/Drew Thomlinson, not Andrei, though their names sound alike.

The NicNeven, had a falling out with a mortal whom she had turned elfin, named Tam Lin, somewhere back in history. He and his love interest, had escaped her clutches, and the burden, of all, ""Elfindom,"" was then placed on Eldritch Spellbound, who had taken up the name, through Hoodoo, being formerly known as, ""Tatter,"" the Clown.

He was not reincarnated as Fu, but as Andrew/Drew Thomlinson.

The NicNeven, it would appear (no matter her incarnation or timeframe), must historically be found, hunting the, ""Neven,"" whether for Nic, or Naught.

'History'.

English: ""...You Can Drive Nature Out With A Pitchfork, But She'll Keep Coming Back...""

""Neven"": ""Marigold.""

'Marigold' (1918),
A Poem by, 'Robert Graves'
(1895-1985),
In his work,
'Fairies and Fusiliers'.

""... With a fork drive Nature out,
She will ever yet return;
Hedge the flowerbed all about,
Pull or stab or cut or burn,
She will ever yet return.
Look: the constant marigold
Springs again from hidden roots.
Baffled gardener, you behold
New beginnings and new shoots
Spring again from hidden roots.
Pull or stab or cut or burn,
They will ever yet return.
Gardener, cursing at the weed,
Ere you curse it further, say:
Who but you planted the seed
In my fertile heart, one day?
Ere you curse me further, say!
New beginnings and new shoots
Spring again from hidden roots.
Pull or stab or cut or burn,
Love must ever yet return...""

'Auburn'.

First, said Wells, it is important to note, that not just anyone gets landed with an Os√©. Let's look at the traits of the alleged, ""Eldritch Spellbound,"" and stop and talk about your employee Mr. Spelling, for a moment, shall we. He was speaking sternly with both Ralph, and Ralph's wife, Adelaide.

Evelyn was looking worried and talking in a low tone, with Jeremy on a couch. She had a box of Kleenex with her.

The question may be asked... Does he have, ""Fall Hair (Auburn)?""

No, said Ralph, of course he doesn't.
His hair's black, said Ren angrily at both Dizzmith and Wells. I have rather fond memories of cutting it.

Then... cutting back at Wells, she interrogated: ""You mean to say, that there is a real demon demigoguess, who just mentally zones, locates, and dumps paralyzing swarms of bugs on people, whom she chooses to target, in, ""any,"" chronological platform of patterning, before time traveling there to do the dirty work herself, while racking in secret Night-Watch Intertel from a hired Time-Wraith Society, and ALSO while scoping Black Markets, all to keep (potentially) all known souls, in an Interface or Web of Dealings, of Self-Serving Matriarchal Feri-Mafia Enslavement, because she has only died once, thus, therefore is known to have practically no parallel, and if she had, she would likely have a traceable reincarnation circuit, but she is too busy forwarding people's death certificates to allow it, and all for filling her necro-toming accreditations for ol' drat-carnem superiority?

What I'm trying to say, said Wells, to Dizzmith, is you've given Andrei a book, of our own study, which will either frighten him off from his better sensibilities, causing him to fraternize with un-in sorts, or make him feel as though he ought to have more of a God Complex.
What's wrong with that, asked Juniper, pettily.
I think I know what Wells is referring to Ralph, said Adelaide.

The section on the French word, ""Hair,"" meaning, ""Hate,"" in English.
That's exactly it, said Wells. And I don't want to be the informer to tell you, that Andrei didn't have it! You see, said Wells, Auburn is Alburn, Alburn is Bleak, Bleak is Odi, Odi is Os, and Os is Ose.

What does that mean? asked Perry, pulling at his brown mop.

Os√© ties to Auburn? Ralph said, slowly, and then with dread clearly marking his face, as Wells went on...

Look, you can't just make candid daimon-boggles of everything said Wells, and this time it'll come back to haunt you.

If that boy is out there, lost somewhere, I will see to it, that your business loses the funding of both, the Synagogues and Churches, for your , ""Antique's Restorative,"" Project.

Your business, said Wells, emphatically, was to put out real demons, with at most, a chinsy retro mark, not chagrin.

See, nobody believes in your artefacts, as idols, Dizzmith. That, was the blessing of it, with all of those artefacts properly, ""Labeled."" Christmas covers a multitude of sins. But to rid all demons from the town, you still have to dupe the faint-of-heart, into once again believing, in the cherished good of olden, fairy tale circuits, and heresy, and somehow, ""sell,"" those things out. You opted for that, because you believed, you could win people over with your natural charisma. That, was what they all counted on you, to do. That means, not erroneously, or however affluently, blessing evil, ""informer circuits,"" with honoros disbelief, and the nonchalance, of an unabashed demon stoop.

Insects were being blown against the store Windows, in the wind.

Ralph began weeping.

Garlic came up to lick his boot.

'The Truth About, ""Lasagna""'.

At the end of the NicNeven's life, ""Lasagna,"" disallowed the sale of her soul into it's currents.

You see, it's first, ""Vampire,"" Memory, as a Dragon, was with the Frater, over a, ""Lasagna,"" and the two of them really did have a lot of fun, sharing one and enjoyed it!

When, ""Lasagna,"" first detected the oncoming current of smoke from the NicNeven, it saw into Swarma's memory, and found out, what she had hired Scientists to do, with Spinach Leaves.

By having Scientists, turn the Leaves into mock Heart Tissue, which inevitably, was only bound, despite all potential alternate turnouts, to degrade the living human material of, ""buying,"" society, into Zombie-like Herbo-Gores! ""Lasagna,"" made a most definite, trade of the NicNeven's smoke-wind, into a circuit of, ""Shawarmas,"" or, ""Doner Kebabs,"" to protect their Sacred Vampire Memory of what she hadn't seen to...

Vegetable Lasagna!

A type made with none other than, ""Spinach Pasta,"" Layering.

Such things (as the NicNeven ought to have known), were inviolable and sacred between, ""Lasagna,"" and the Frater, in the Den!

""Lasagna,"" while in meditation with the Frater, had found Eldritch Spellbound, lying on the ground, and secreted to him (in a dole of wind), that he had just narrowly avoided Swarma... and Death!

But, furthermore... That, if he wanted, he could retire now, and escape it all!

Eldritch did just that, and upon, ""Lasagna's,"" recommendation, returned to his Hometown, where he took up his stead as a Deli Butcher and Bookbinder, and also, working once again, as a Carney at the Seasonal Fair.

There, he would talk grandly and sell, ""Doner Kebabs,"" which he was made gratefully famous for, having been told by, ""Lasagna,"" that the first, ""Doner Kebab,"" he would prepare in his circuit, would offer him, and only him, a true taste for success, as the whole, ""Doner Kebab,"" circuit had been made ridden, by the NicNeven.

In order to help Eldritch Spellbound on his way, Frater Antic and, ""Lasagna,"" had a Seal Drawn, in the Den, to Summon a Mean, ""Doner,"" for the Let in of... ""Swarma.""

After all... Only under Antic, could she ever regard an Oni as if she, in her mortal life, was willful enough to control one.

And that was how, ultimately, she in her mortal life, had done so.

You see... she was let in on him, by him. He was not truly a test tube Oni.

* The child, who once sported the mask, bore no defect, and had a soul. *

The mask had only reported to the real Oni, what was going on in Avem's Lab.

Avem's time traveling, in her mortal circuit, had derailed somewhere...

Could it have been that she was truthfully dead after eating that rotten black apple, which she had injected the serum into?

That would be it!

The Time Wraith Society, which she had hired, urged her into it, as they decided they'd be better off without her. They'd already received funding.

She had lived her whole life, morbidly infatuated with Feri Tales, and had grandiose expectations of the Pharmaceutical Industry rewarding her with, ""Eternal Life Secrets,"" for, which she misfiled and disaccredited on every and I mean not any other, but every occasion.

Avem had, indeed, studied Biochem and Medicine, but she malpracticed and made detrimental judgement calls in her life, which should never have been in her jurisdiction.

She was a Dragon, only to the Time Wraiths... Her favourite band of young hooligans (a rancorous bunch), and, would you care to know?... Some of them were real Spiritual Night Wizards, Wraiths, and, ""Time,"" Bandits!

She counted on them, to work HER profile up, for the Drugs and Money she was giving them, and the Secret, Nightly, Liaisons she might have had, or in all truth, the trips around the World, she most definitely had had, many times over, before her actual untimely end.

Her legacy, was poignantly disdainful and for lack of any better terms, ""psychopomped,"" and, ""inwardly-gloated.""

The NicNeven and Swarma, though? Well, they were two entirely, separate people.

The NicNeven had attempted to sell her soul into the Dragon, ""Lasagna,"" but on Avem's technicality, of Spinach being the so-called, ""NicNeven's,"" doing... Well, let's just say that, ""Lasagna,"" had decided to differ on that one (they were in an, ""All-Time,"" Den), and put the NicNeven into ""Doners (i.e. ""Shawarmas"").""

Nice save by Avem, actually.

But, to redeem Avem's soul, Frater let her into the Den, through the Tibetan, ""Black Diamond""/""Hua Niu,"" Apple miolo.

The Frater, could not hurt someone like Swarma, after all... She was just too cool!

He found out that she used to make jokes about her name, while eating, ""Doner Kebabs,"" in the first place, and imagining she could take over the World.

Anyhow, Eldritch, at that point, was a Carney again, and Christian, relieved of his, ""REAL,"" fairy burden (The NicNeven), through the miracle dole of a, ""Doner,"" by, ""Lasagna.""

The whole circuit of, ""Doners,"" had been ridden from the true, ""NicNeven,"" and would later be called off the Market.

As Eldritch had hidden, written at the end of one of his Books/Journals,

""... As the, ""Doners,"" Pile,
The NicNeven, Shan't Annihil',
For if any were to Stake,
""Shawarmas,"" Were Too Great!
Want to Buy One?
Why Wait?...""

Anyhow, ""Lasagna,"" was truly, a Good-Natured Dragon, and, though not initially from the East, was still donned, and reined, as fairly auspicious.

""Lasagna,"" made the choice, to dole the NicNeven, because, they did not need any Evil Queen of Feri or anyone Overly-Matriarchal, to overbear, on the Frater.

‚ÄòIs Andrew Evil?‚Äô

What Andrew Thomlinson faced, was a life, unforgiven... What started off as ignorance, became the futility that comes from trying furiously to control matters beyond one's control.

He gave in...
Where's that Book?

Pulling over his Merriam Webster's Deluxe Dictionary, he asked for an, ""Elfin Name.""

Flipping it open, he landed on the word, ""Eldritch,"" meaning, ""Weird,"" ""Eerie,"" ""Uncanny,"" and, ""Hideous.""

Fascinated as he was, by the prospects behind, finding the meaning of his new, ""Wizarding,"" name, which had Root Words, in ""Elf Kingdom,"" he had yet to reckon with the fact that he had just performed literal, ""Book Ouija,"" or, ""Bibliomancy,"" accurately.

The year was 2004.

Divination was un-in the Kingdom of God, which meant, he had just ignorantly sold his soul to an unknown Spirit, ""contractually,"" for the bidden performance of, ""Fact-Retrieval-at-Random.""

That, and he was unforgiven, because he had been abusive to his pet cats.

He was told he could not keep them if they were too feral around the house. Andrew wanted to test his luck with training them and was having no luck. He was relying upon a cat behaviour book and, his aggression therewith, though not a better known trait of his, would lose him his good name with many people. Not to mention with pressures of identity, religion, and failures at school, he was unprepared for his future. What did happen? Coming home from school one day, he found that one of his cats was dying. He had lost his cat to ill treatment in his care.

Unsure of what caused the complications in the cats health, the family had thought that maybe it had consumed something poisonous.
Andrew felt guilt over this, and would not speak about it until much later. He still wanted to keep his other cat.

He was not intellectually fit for many things. His studies of magic (Truly, a, ""Bastard""/""Fatherless,"" Science), were to be regarded likewise. Magick was unfounded, and Andrew would not Father a Science, so it was only Delusion to think that such Prideful Ambition, wouldn't have found him lacking his God-moral and deter him from healthier pursuits.

Why did he have to go there?

Sensationalism of the World.

He was Spiritually Dead.

He had only been Romanticizing Witchcraft for it's allure of apparent cure-all, and Naturalism.
Not as a Law.

Now it seemed he had even broken their Harm None Do As Thou Wilt, Principle.

Although he wasn't Hereditary, the Faith of others rushed to avail him to no positive result. Something had Andrew on a Damnation Circuit.

He was Mental.

His Spiritual Senses, which at first were occluded, eventually began to open up somewhat, but it was too late and Andrew found himself in a World where he was Dependent, still too Ignorant, and Hated.

2008, he bought a Bible out of his own frustration with his self-damnation.

2012, he found an answer to what only became a Riddle.

Why had he Chosen the Snow Leopard as a Love Totem or Spirit Animal?

Well it was not so.

Nevertheless, two articles in the city newspaper had featured leopards in headlines. One as an animal, and one as a man. Specifically a dancer. He would find the apparitions manifest in tangible form, by 2021. He took pictures of these with his Smartphone, and put them up on his Instagram Photo Gallery over the Internet.

---

A Demon, which makes one think they're a Creature, a King, and then a Pope.

As a Burden?

It was called Os√©.

The Elves were an Obsession and had him Sexually Ridden. Old Medicinal Texts explained that elves were disease spirits, and then Andrew determined that he had a demonic problem. They Drove him Mad, and he had harmed himself. Up until living at Joseph Buccini's Duplex on Lipton, Elves (really Hobgoblins), of a kind called Bucca, were all he could think about. Bucca, being synonymous with Os.

Afterward, Andrew turned to Christianity.
He lived at a Building called Monarch Manor, owned by Wilf Zimmer in Portage La Prairie. Studying the Bible, he found his newness indicating a probable in as an heir of Judah, because he still had to learn to put his idolatry away. His problem at the time, was that he idolized an albeit fictitious, Satanic Cartoon Character, a Noble or AntiChristian Earl named Ciel Phantomhive, whom he saw as sharing coincidences with his Past Occulting Art.

Andrew eventually moved back to Winnipeg where his landlord Tom Grieve at Elgin, was notified of strange occurrences happening with Frost Etchings on Windows and Dreams in Tobacco Pipes. His landlord may not have taken those notices seriously, but Andrew would find that although the frequency of these occurrences diminished a little over time, they persisted still, even up until 2019 at Jave on Sargent. A building owned by Myra. The Bishop of Myra, commonly being referred to as Saint Nick.

Smoke and Ice Miracles though they may be, Os√© does not make Andrew a Jack Frost.
Andrew had a Demon, which blessed his Beast and his Holy, in his very Order of Turning to God.

It Bit the Canon.

But how would he ever own a Truth?

Self-Dissolution?

---

Andrei was not Andrew.

Andrei had never Smoked.

Andrew started Smoking in 2015.

Any thoughts on whether, if Andrei had $40.00 worth of Smokes in his pocket, he would give them to Andrew?

Andrei may not have been a smoker, but one thing he arded to be, was cautious, so the response to the former question would be likely not. What Andrei had, was a Soul.

What Andrew didn't have, was his own.

Andrew could Hope that there was a Kind Spirit trying to Save Him from the Evils...

Though his first devotion in 2002, to, ""Hecate,"" and, ""Cerridwen (Evil Witch, Crone Goddesses of Paganism),"" had him faced with the knowledge of their matron, ""An,"" followed by an Anomaly of recurring names from various females, which seemed to pop up everywhere he went, by 2012.

Finally, in 2013, Andrew was intimate with a woman. His (now ex) girlfriend, ""Jenny,‚Äù was, ""Anita Jenny?‚Äù

Andrew‚Äôs Jaw, Dropped‚Ä¶

Anyhow,
The word, ""Ais,"" means, ""Ice,"" but in Welsh, means, ""Rib,"" the Latin Root Word of, which, is, ""Os.""

The Word, ""Os,"" means, ""Bone,"" but also, ""Smoke""/""Reek.""

That doesn't mean, that Os√© had been summoned on him, but what else could it have meant?

Well, if Prophets saw his life in advance, before his life had come into existence, and made a taboo over it, for his being too disobedient, and then thought of it more as though it were their, ""summons pool of un-in,"" then to be classified Os√©, have it at another... Maybe, ""Wells,"" would know‚Ä¶ If Andrew had known him.

At least one man, had to exist for the Demon Os√© to have it's circuit of proof, proven valid in existence. If no substantial remaining proof, even in all, ""Santa-Dom,"" exists, which it surely would have, if Os√©, for all his Smoke and Ice, and even Osa (Wasps/""White Anglo-Saxon Protestants""), truly was a, ""Santa Claus""-making demon... even if then, it may not be...

Though, demons might've been real.
However, not everyone believes in Demons.
People believe in Hate.

Not to be without irony, Andrew's Demon is known for it's meaning of, ""Hate.‚Äù

The problem with knowing it that thoroughly though, was would there be one Saviour to give him Revelation, on the way?

For these occurrences, which were only abominable (Abominable Circuits, don't go to Heaven), Andrew was already un-in a Good, but for a Family that Gave a Care, when Andrew, obviously, can't go to Heaven, unless it really was a Demon and could successfully be exorcised, but then, Andrew?... Can his life be relearned?

---

'Others'.

There were Two Other Demons like this (at least), I'm sure...

""Ouroboros,"" and, ""Aim.""

A Serpent, which Devours it's Tail, representing the Hebrew Letter, ""Teth,"" in the Kabbalah, and the ""Universe,"" by its
""Molt""-en.

And the Other?

A Fire Demon, which Lights Designated Localities Up, in a Blaze, upon Command of one's Will.

Thankfully, Andrew was (for the most part), sold out of his Will Power.

---

'Name'.

Andrew had confessed the Death of Kato to his Government Health Providers.

He had also worked it out, to his Siamese Cat, as to how, if all Lives have a Purpose, his cats may have been in it, somehow, to boon him with a Tobacco Circuit of Vision.

* God Save All Suffering Creatures. Even the Circle of Life, and Reincarnation Transcendency Orders, can't always be believed in. (Isaiah 11).

If the Demon Os√© was real, a pool cue and feces, surely would have found Kato.

Demons of Words.
There were Three Cats that made a Lasting Impression:

‚Ä¢ Kato taught him, that Wiccan, ""Hands on Healing (in the Unexpected and Tragic Dying of a Cat),"" doesn't work like a Change of Religion to Christianity can work to prevent it.

But Andrew has a broken, ""Psycho-Framework of a Mentality.""

It is not IQ level... it is looseness of bearance on smarts, and how it is subjective, subjunctive, or puts you in a phase where you cannot put it to a quit, if not up.

Yes, there are Sporadic Insights, which Make For Good Journaling, but we know

'Davil'.

""... We are the Davidoon...""

Andrew let his air go, and tried to maintain a flow of constrained babble, while keeping his consciousness above and apart from it... Watching the words as much as he could mentally, while trying to stay, for the most part, uninvolved.

He sat in front of his cell phone, audio recorder.
How many people are going to be hearing this, apart from my neighbours, he thought.

Not too many, it might overload, but maybe in awhile I can release some of it over the Internet.

Does anyone care to listen to other people babble?

Andrew had tried to evolve in his circuit far enough to make a University circuit and failed. Failed like, too hard!

He had left, afterward.

He was now on Welfare, receiving remedial attention from PsycHealth and yet, Psychoanalyzing himself.

By now, he had confessed a few other things where it mattered the most...  Hopefully.
Trying drugs and looking up sex?

---

‚ÄòNot Mentally Minded‚Äô.

He'd been naive enough, back in 2007, to believe that his female Roommate would have died, if she took a Drug, which she bought. The two lived alone, in a house that they shared. As soon as she told him, he tried it with her, because of his failings. They had him in the Hospital for Professional Help, soon following.

After awhile, he confessed looking up women, because he had an inferiority complex, but talked big.

His manhood had been damaged since a circumcision in Grade Two, which only took place, because he got an Infection in the Bathtub...

Anyhow, this... Plus Bullying Circuits, in and around his Elementary School, where consequent visits to the washroom stall, generated gossip, because of it, had been his realm of traumatic induction into societal banter.

His Dad had left when he was four, and he was now growing up to be the Older Brother of the Son of his Mother and her Boyfriend. Both Adults, really still just his Mother on her own, nurtured him with good care, and slight out of Manning.

They had him retro-fitted from looking like a dashing prep, to a hillbilly, in no time, and it was because he was, like no other terms could bless, a, ""Special Effect.""

All in all, this began to tell him that his feelings over needing to guard his stuff/possessions, and be reluctant to share, to feel at home, would not repair the father he felt he had somehow given up. It was  however, more on his father's own end.

Did it seem gay to his mother, when Andrew went to console his Mother with his toys, though. Andrew didn't know.

She put her head down, at the table, that day. He loved her, but she WAS distraught, this WAS NOT a minor problem. It could be that he seemed less concerned than he should have given the state of emergency. Did she sell him out as a soul-less demon spawn, for being anything like his Heartless Father. Likely not.

Anyhow, it was as though, Andrew had left his upstanding circuit for an eternal, ""ME.""

The child who doesn't side with at least one of his/her parents at some point, is the self-ingratiated or un-in own? Four Years, and Andrew hadn't taken after? Well, in truth, he had loved both equally, but his life was probably too free of care. Leaving his mother in angst and Andrew, to become all the more judicious and unprepared.

‚Ä¢ To The Old Man (as though I never missed you), if only my mother knew I didn't bat my eye at the thought you would leave, because I knew her security more than I knew your fidelity. What can I say? An idiot like me shouldn't be left to judge his parents.

Still, the boy had no tact or sensitivity for many years.

If no less than cupboard love, Andrew WAS still outmoded by A Cat Caretaking!

It gets harder to communicate, when seeming slow or homosexual to your Mother, and when you have everyone thinking you are, because you're not even concerned with your mother's dating or your own. You've got bigger obstacles like being intellectually stunted over a bent manhood, and no man of the house can call you the Little Man, you once were. Your Mom knows it's still you. But a surgery dements you over the fact that you only started looking at it, ‚Äúinformed,‚Äù around the time the surgery on it was had. This means mainly, that you can't reasonably afford to look at anyone without becoming paranoid or self-obsessed if in lieu of it.

Though, the other men are strangers in your circuit, and your father is no more than one dusted, accumulating on the repossession of an entire household, they still do more harm to her than to you.

My mom was paranoid I'd grow up to be like them. I was paranoid I wouldn't ever feel like I was really my own man.

‚Ä¢ I am Grateful (to eternity), that my Mom has stamina, and finesses her homemaking, for a do-over.

When you need her, and don't know why, she's there, but she never tells you about the crucial moment, when she needed you. She just keeps.
I was the, ""House-Bend.""

Really, Andrew wasn't his own man ever. He was sold out for his dysfunctions, but that doesn't EVER make him innocent.

On that note, he became, ""Epileptic,"" with Undiagnosed, but Consequential, ""Memory Loss,"" but for really hard meditations, getting him there...

*Thank you, God, for the peace of keys (... Writing here...).*

~ Andrew's mother, had once assured him, he was a Big Brother, and his Younger Brother would probably one day Grow Up to Be Bigger than him, because Andrew's Dad had been Shorter than his Brother's Dad?~

That only meant that Andrew would have more to worry about, if he didn't please‚Ä¶ the both of them.

On the topic of Drew Thomlinson, who in all actual fact, goes by the moniker Eldritch Spellbound, could he go by Tam Lin?

""Eerie's,"" Uncanny Ba'alister Name (Tam Lin), Can't Really Relate To Andrew's Last Name of Thomlinson, as Historically, Andrew's Last Name, Relates to, ""Doubting Thomas,"" in the Bible.

Andrew is in no way a full, ""Butterscotch,"" as a Cigarette Butt Smoker, so in no way, ""Toffy,"" if and when he ever has a Hardened Heart.
Insofar, as the name Eldritch?

There's an old phrase, ‚ÄúDreeing One's Weird.‚Äù Essentially what it means, is, ""Surrendering to One's Fate""'.

~Discussing The Candy Circuit.~

On, ""All Hallow's Eve,"" also known as the, ""Judas Kiss,"" Holiday, at some point back in time, both, ""Hocus Pocus,"" and, ""Trick or Treat,"" were strategically and secretly implemented, as two (slightly conspicuous, but not as blasphemous as may be thought), phrases, which were to, ""Cross,"" the Ancient, ""Day of the Dead,"" to make for a more Careful and Planned Holiday for Townsfolk to participate in, all around the Globe, and even until the present.

Let that be a Peace unto you, who sit at home, discomfit on Hallowe'en, Samhain or Elvenblot, as if it were truly, more and not less, a thing out of evil.

Less evil than treacle, really.

But who expects harm from the Neighbours in their Neighbourhood Circuit, when they sneak up Masked to the Doors for Candy, early in the evening, on a public holiday, anyhow?

The phrases, which originally meant, ""Deceiver's Kiss,"" and/or, ""Deceiver's Pouch,"" gave us an in, that even Voudoun Circuits didn't quite make, by their in of, ""Catholicism.""
It gave us the power, to make One Night, a full, ""Collective Ba'aldom,"" of, ""Judas Iscariot.""

But let's face it, People ARE too scared to hand out Bibles to Strangers at their Doors, on Hallowe'en.

Also? UNICEF, is more of an Insurance Policy! Definitely, a good idea to collect and pay it forward.

Don't forget!

LPT Sometimes the most meaningful thing you can do for someone that‚Äôs gone through something painful is to simply acknowledge their pain.,"
My parents were divorced when I was about 10. It was, obviously, difficult for me as it is with all children who go through it. Also like many children, I did not understand the full extent or nature of the pain I felt at that time until I was much older. 

I am 30 now with a wife and kids of my own. I have a great job in a great town and, by any objective measure, have a wonderful life. But that pain stays with me‚Ä¶At some point I realized it will never fully subside.

My boss is a great person. Very kind and generous, yet demanding and particular in a positive way that makes you want to do your best. As an adult far from where I grew up, he‚Äôs the closest I have to a father figure.

We don‚Äôt often discuss personal matters, but while conversing he asked what my parents do. The answer makes it readily apparent that they reside in different cities and I saw a flash of discernment in his eyes.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre divorced?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúYa, when I was 10,‚Äù I said in that rehearsed manner designed to convey no emotion at all but also discourage further discussion of the topic.

He paused, looking me directly in the eye. Finally, he said ‚ÄúI know that must have been very difficult for you.‚Äù Those words were more meaningful to me than anything any relative, therapist or teacher ever said. I felt‚Ä¶ seen, known, understood. Another moment passed, and then we moved to other subjects. 

When I was next alone, I cried for the first time that I can recall since leaving home.

St Joseph--Protector of Homes Prayer,"My sisters and brothers, I wanted to share this prayer with you all for peace and protection for your homes. In times where we are staying more at home, there could be great distress and arguments among family members, and even threat of evictions. I pray that no matter the circumstance, this prayer can be a reminder to you that the Holy Family went through it all for Jesus. St Joseph as the foster father of Jesus is the perfect one to look to for wisdom and faith so that our homes may be protected from all harm, from the inside out. I can personally say that this prayer has truly helped in times of great troubles in my house with lots of arguing and other troubles. I pray that this prayer will also give you peace in your homes. God bless. 

PRAYER:

*St. Joseph,* protect our home. Pour forth from heaven blessings on our family. Remain in our midst. Help us to live in love and harmony, in peace and joy. May the wholesome fear of God strengthen us that virtue may adorn what we do and our way may lead to heaven.

To you this day I give the key to our dwelling place. Lock out all things that could do us harm. Lock my home and my loved ones with me in the hearts of Jesus and Mary. This I beg of you, that our days may be like your days in the holy home at Nazareth.

I (13m) have issues with my family and see no way out,"Hi, Mark! I been bottling this up for a while now and want to know your opinion. English is not my first language and I am on mobile.

So I (13m) have my direct family which contains my mom (45f), my dad (47m) and my brother (14m). I also have two half brothers (21 and 22) who live in a different province and I have NC with one (21) due to an issue with my mom that he has and LC with the other due to age difference. I have ADHD and autism and my brother and father have autism (my mom doesn't) due to this my brother and father are emotionally completely unavailable for me which makes it hard to connect sometimes.

My brother pretty much only thinks about himself and his circle and doesn't care about much else. It doesn't affect him? It doesn't matter. And because of this he is fucking insensitive ( he told once said that I : ' couldn't talk to him like that, missy'. I'm transgender FTM so that stung and still stings but I was forced to forgive because he was ' just joking' and couldn't help it because he was autistic)

My father is completely dependent on my mother and calls my mom for pretty much everything even after the divorce (which also hurt me a lot but again was forced to move on and was made to feel selfish for being upset because it was 'better this way') my mother and father married and divorced twice so that's pretty telling. He isn't emotionally there for me and that has left me to feel abandoned and alone multiple times but he is physically there for me so there's that. ( like driving me places, picking me up, etc)

My mother is 'completely done with my father' or so she says. She's always said/screamed this at my father multiple times but just doesn't leave him. She rants to me about my father and talks about how terrible he and my grandma are because he 'gives her to much credit for things my mother did' and 'he never stands up to his mom' but also always returns to him. When she does start crying or starts an argument with father, I need to reassure her that she's doing not her wrong and that it's not her fault and that she should leave and stuff. The thing is? I don't wanna talk about stuff like that. I wanna help mother but the constant badmouthing my father, my grandma and basically my intire father's side of the family makes me feel sad and like I'm picking sides whenever I talk to my father's side, or hell even my own father and lately the fights and comforting has gotten worse now that it's summer vacation.

All this plus stress from the shitty school year (not to do with covid. There was a issue with the teacher that resulted in me going home crying every Friday) plus covid, left me stressed and crying most of the times. It hits at random moment and when it does, I lose all motivation for my hobbies and start feeling terrible.

When I would talk to my mother about these moments (which happend regularly) it would be choked up to hormones or I would get a 'everything will be oke' and a 'you need to be more positive about life' which to be fair, I am fairly negative but taht because I feel so helpless and alone. I have asked for therapy or someone to talk to before and were working on it but it's just taking to long.

A few weeks ago my mother had a fairly stupid arguement with my father about him crediting his mother for trying a specific flavor while my mother claimed she had him try it. After a while of me doing the 'just leave' and the 'it's not you it's him' I just broke down. I told my mom how I just wished I had a normal family, with brother who cared enough about me to be there for me, with an emotionally available father, with parents who are together, with a school where I feel safe and with a mother who doesn't drink. I just started crying at that point an dmy mom hugged me but I just feel so alone.

I am starting to think that there is no way out. To the point where some dark thoughts have crossed my mind and me thinking what it would change if I was gone. Honestly at this point the only two things that keep me afloat are my bestfriend and marvel but between family, gender and school issue I feel like there is no way out.

Can somebody help? Is there a way out or not?

DDLC Happily Never After - A big thank you!,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img gitb2zs6bqj71...*

So, I need to start out with what I wanted to say most in this post and that is screaming a big THANK YOU to everyone who took time to read (and hopefully enjoy) Happily Never After.  When I began writing it I knew that I had a story that I wanted to tell, but creating something that would be unique within the Dokiverse was going to be a challenge.  Of the countless fics that I'd seen already they all seemed to have a common thread, an underlying message of hope, wholesomeness and love, and that seemed to be persistent no matter how dark the fic was trying to get.  And then I thought to myself...

&amp;#x200B;

...what would happen if we stripped out the sugar coating and gave these girls some of the most horrid life circumstances you could run across.  25 chapters later we have our answer with 2 of them dead, one with multiple suicide attempts and one a single mother now.  I had a specific tagline in the back of my head when writing a lot of this: *There is no hope, no one is coming to save you.*  And I like to believe that I really drove that point home in some of the events that took place, in particular the Glasgow Smile scene (and for those of you who aren't sure what I'm talking about, keep reading because it may be the most brutal scene in the story).  

&amp;#x200B;

Now to address the elephant in the room.  What's next?  

&amp;#x200B;

You may have noticed on the cover art for Happily Never After that I specified this is Volume I.  During my time writing this volume I was already working on the storyboard for Volume II and hashing out preliminary ideas for how I want to see the entire Literature Club Chronicles play out.  When all was said and done I decided that there was enough going on that it was going to take approximately six volumes to tell the entire story.  Happily Never After took its time in taking off the kid gloves before putting on the brass knuckles.  If I had to think of a proper way to describe The Saints of Sin City, it begins by wearing brass knuckles and swaps out to a revolver by the end.  It's a much darker story, and something I am really excited for is a serious focus on some of the new characters that were introduced in Happily Never After, in particular Kaori and exploring her relationship with her older sister and what role she is going to play in the story moving ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

If I had to think of most impactful scene that I've created so far in Saints of Sin City (so far)...all I will say is it involved Genji and Sayori (Omni), and that is as far as I'm willing to go mentioning it since I want it to be a complete surprise when readers get there.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you again for everyone who was willing to stop by and take a read, I am always happy to hear everyone's thoughts in the comments, good or bad!  Enjoy the short VN strip that I created above, and I will see you all again real soon when I launch the first chapters of The Saints of Sin City!",DDLC,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/pc3dqh/ddlc_happily_never_after_a_big_thank_you/,Custom Dialogue,Umbral_Agent,pc3dqh,/r/DDLC/comments/pc3dqh/ddlc_happily_never_after_a_big_thank_you/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLC/comments/pc3dqh/ddlc_happily_never_after_a_big_thank_you/,7,2021-08-26
I am finally letting go of my mom forever.,"I finally got to talk to my dad after about 6 or 7 years of not being able to.

My mother kept me away from him and used me as a free check and housing while dumping me off with my grandma and keeping me away from my dad. Whenever I made my grandma upset she'd tell me ""this is why they don't want you"".

Truthfully, they both kept me away from my dad. He reached out to them both on Facebook around the time I was about 18 to around the time I was 21. He got blocked by my mom and my grandma pretended she had no idea where I was or how to contact me.

Once I found him on Facebook everything changed.

My mom can't spare me a penny but my dad will send me whatever he can. He has 2 other kids but admitted he didn't really want them after what happened with me and my mom.

My thoughts are incredibly scattered. I'll get to the point. My dad made me remember something I never wanted to. I recall being about 10 years old and being on the computer in my room, and my mom had company over. I forgot what the topic was about, possibly something about having a gay child (she's a lesbian, how ironic.) Said something along the lines of ""I'd beat the shit out of my kid if he turned out gay. But I'm glad I don't have kids.""

So what am I? Nothing?

Another time I was 16 and she had a friend over. Again, I was locked in my room being an introvert that I was; I think I went out to get some water when this woman looked at me with shock. She introduced us and she tells me ""oh wow, W never told me she had a daughter.""

Damn. So these pictures on the wall are just some random stock photos?

But when she got with her girlfriend, she didn't mind spending time with her 2 sons. She always had them while I was tossed off with grandma. They were probably about 6 and 8 years old. I thought she hated kids? Or did she just hate me?

Worst of all is how they used me as a bargaining chip. My dad had to walk on thin ice for the longest time and any time he said something they didn't like, they'd keep me away from him. I remember being attached to him as a small child, so having that ripped away from me tore me to shreds. While he was gone I was groomed by two of my cousins. Once when I was 3 and another when I was 8. Nobody in my family knew. When I told them they called me a liar. My dad still doesn't know because I can't bear to tell him.

But then my mom would turn around and say that my grandpa molested me, which resulted in my grandparents getting divorced and my grandma resenting me since that happened. A three year old isn't going to understand the context of ""did he touch you?"" When you don't specify how or where. I assumed she meant hugs and kisses. And I'll hate myself for as long as I love for it.

She needed my grandpa out of my life because he was the only one who stood up for my dad. And since he wasn't my biological grandpa (her dad) she did anything she could to get him out of the picture.

My mom directly ruined 4 people's lives all because she was being a selfish, miserable petty bitch.

I think what stuck to me most was when I got into the biggest fight with my grandma. I had left my ex and come back home, but since I was seeing another guy/my current spouse *that just so happened to not be white* she had an absolute shitshow about it.

Basically she told me he was using me for a greencard and how he was already engaged with a 16 year old wife and 3 kids with another on the way. She'd never met this guy in her life and I never told her about him. My ex did.

I dont want to get into too much detail but the thing that made me step out was when she said ""you think I wanted any of this? I never wanted you. Any of you. You're all worthless just like your grandpa. I never should have left the man I was with for him because I regret it every day of my life.""

*Not my fault you were a serial cheater but ok. projection much?*

I just wish my mom loved me. I begged for her love for the first 17 years of my life but the only time she calls me is when she needs something. But now I'm realising that it just isn't worth it. She took away my grandpa, my dad, my dogs, my cat, stole money from me, lent my social security to another girlfriend of hers, lied about it(or didn't believe me), pawned my gaming devices several times, and so much worse. Her girlfriend stalks my social media and spams my phone from private numbers because my stupid ass mom jacked it to scream at her over the phone and all I wanted to do was wash my clothes.

But she'll get what's coming to her. Karma is already getting her.

AITA for doing something about my neighbours' chicken ?,"Hi I am in a tense situation with my neighbours and I'm not sure what to think of it.

First of all it's going to be weird since I am going to talk about dead chickens, second of all English is not my first language so sorry if I make mistakes and third of all sorry for the length.

Bit of background :

My neighbours decided to move out a few months ago and have been living in their new house since the begining of August. They have two chickens but they can't juste take the henhouse with them like that. So they left them here and come every two/three days to check on them (their old house is not yet sold so it's empty).

Problem is that saturday night, a fox or a weasel came and attacked the chickens. One didn't make it but the other yes.

Our houses are sperated with a short wall and tall wire mesh being 10cm distant and the animal took the corspe there but couldn't take it out so it just stayed there between the wall and wire mesh. I went to see the other and she was hurt but ok so I just fed her then locked her up in case.

We called the morning after and they just said ""*Oh ok. I was scared you were saying we got robbed.*"" Understandable but still irritated me since a hen still is a living thing. Anyway they said they would come and get it to bury it (it was too far for us to reach).

They came two days after with good clothes, no tool and stayed for a total 10 to 15 minutes but they got mad and flew right back home. Which is for the context 2 min away from the old one. They called us saying the father would come the evening or the next day.

After 4 days still nothing moved and the smell started coming to our windows every time there was wind and the other hen was still locked up.

My mom got super mad and we took the chicken out and put it in their compost (we didn't know where to bury), freed the other chicken and let it roam in their garden (I think she's in ours now because they used to jump over the wall but I'm not sure).

She then sent a message saying ""*Well after 4 days with 2 really hot days I took the dead hen corpse that was rotting with dripping worms and place it in your compost.*""

The mom neighbour then called and said ""Y*ou never sent something this hurtful in 15 years and it broke me, my daughter is crying because of your message. My husband has been taken by work and anyway you could've called even at midnight and we would've got it. For the smell I didn't say a thing when we were eating outside and I could smell you cats' shit* (btw she has a dog so could've been my animals and hers but I get it)"".

That pissed my mom even more and she tried to explain that we did call and for the smell they could've told us and we would've done something.

Now I feel really bad for the chicken and the daughter because we used to be bestfriends but I know this can't be repaired. I know I kind of depicted them in a bad way but I am mad too and don't know what to say/think/do.

So AITA for putting the chicken in the compost and not call them before or bury it ?",AmItheAsshole,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbx23g/aita_for_doing_something_about_my_neighbours/,,throwaway3012_,pbx23g,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbx23g/aita_for_doing_something_about_my_neighbours/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbx23g/aita_for_doing_something_about_my_neighbours/,20,2021-08-26
It seems like studios may be realizing it's time to capitalize on nostalgia...,"It‚Äôs a mix of pure coincidence and delays caused by COVID-19, but here‚Äôs a small list of studios that are cashing in on nostalgia either this year or in 2022:

&amp;#x200B;

* Marvel/Sony - Spider-Man: No Way Home (December 17, 2021) 

The return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield with their respective villains via the multiverse as a following to Loki and What If..?, and a set up for the rest of Phase 4 (I follow the Marvel Studios spoilers subreddit, it‚Äôs pretty much confirmed at this point).

&amp;#x200B;

* Paramount/Hasbro - Transformers: Rise of Beasts (June 24, 2022)

Due to the financial failure Transformers: The Last Knight was for Paramount, a return to G1 (and other popular animated Transformers shows) style Transformers like in Bumblebee (ironically with the exception of Bumblebee himself) in full force is somewhat regaining the trust of the fanbase lost with Age of Extinction (even though it made a billion at the box office, it was largely popularized as the worst Transformers movie until the Last Knight).

&amp;#x200B;

* Universal - Jurassic World: Dominion (June 10, 2022)

The return of the original Jurassic Park trio (Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum) in a more prominent role than Goldblum‚Äôs cameo in Fallen Kingdom to close out the current ‚Äúera‚Äù of the Jurassic Park and it‚Äôs 5 (soon to be 6) film storyline.

&amp;#x200B;

* Lucasfilm/Disney - Indiana Jones 5 (July 28, 2022) 

Could be argued in both ways, but this movie can be seen as a last ditch attempt by Disney to cash in on Lucasfilm‚Äôs second most valuable property: Harrison Ford‚Äôs Indiana Jones (stated Ford's name because hopefully the role will continue to only be played by Ford as time passes). I myself am not against the movie or its intents though as I am personally excited for its debut.

DC/WB - The Flash (November 4, 2022)

The return of Michael Keaton‚Äôs Batman via the multiverse in an attempt to try and fix the DCEU through Flashpoint.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

To reiterate, most of this list's films were caused to be set on these release dates due to COVID-19, but it's just really convenient how some (mostly nitpicking because there are plenty of other blockbusters that aren't relying on nostalgia) of the most anticipated films for the rest of this year and next year are relying on the nostalgia of the public to gain a profit ( I guess it's nothing out of the ordinary then in hindsight).",boxoffice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/pbpmov/it_seems_like_studios_may_be_realizing_its_time/,:other: Other,PrussianAvenger,pbpmov,/r/boxoffice/comments/pbpmov/it_seems_like_studios_may_be_realizing_its_time/,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/pbpmov/it_seems_like_studios_may_be_realizing_its_time/,22,2021-08-26
Lenovo Legion y740-15IRHg Graphics Card Issues,"TLDR; Computer stopped working and has a swollen battery and graphics card issue. Drivers have fixed some of the problem but unsure if the remaining issue is driver related or hardware failure. Video link below shows issue.

Specs:

Processor

1x Intel Core i7-9750H Processor()

Memory

1x 16GB DDR4 2666

Operating System

Windows 10 Home 64(EN:English)

Hard Drive

1x 1TBPCIeNVMe

Graphics

1x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060

Monitor

15.6 1920x1080

I‚Äôve been having an issue with my Lenovo Legion y740. I‚Äôve had my computer for 2 years now. Updated my computer through Vantage about a year after I got it. I‚Äôve read now that seems to be an issue for a lot of people. Causes a glitching issue with my screen but was fixed after I installed the latest video driver from their support website.¬†

About 6 months later I left my computer on over night and came back to it basically feeling like it was moving through a swamp and unusable. Tried rebooting and my computer was basically bricking at that point. Half of the time it wouldn‚Äôt even boot past the loading screen and when it did get to the windows log in it would practically freeze.¬†

Took it to a local shop to have it looked at and they found two issues. The battery has swelled and they suspected something was wrong with the video card and/or the SSD but they couldn‚Äôt pin point what.¬†

They took the battery out for me since it‚Äôs a safety hazard. I took it home and started doing some more digging to see what I could find before I called Lenovo. I found that booting in safe mode let the computer run normally. I then disabled the video card and rebooted normally and the computer performed fine under the integrated graphics. This told it was the video card for sure. Once I tried enabling it the computer would lock up again.¬†

I then went to look to see if it was a driver issue before I determined hardware failure. I saw the driver had a release date of 7/12/2021. I think this was a generic driver from Nvidia for the 2060. If I update the driver through the windows UI it pulls it from Nvidia and not Lenovo so I think it somehow got changed through windows. I went back and reinstalled the latest driver from the Lenovo support site for my laptop. I noticed this driver is nearly a year old now (Nov 19 2020) and when I installed it I was now able to boot normally with the video card enabled.¬†

However, now I have an issue where the screen will randomly turnoff/change to black every 3-5 seconds as you can hopefully see in the video I linked. You can also hear the fans going crazy and will stay that way until the computer is on for nearly 30 minutes. This issue occurs on any screen no matter what is being done. This issue does not occur when the card is disabled or while in safe mode.¬†

I‚Äôm really at a loss for what to do now. I‚Äôve messed with video settings in windows, I‚Äôve tried older versions of drivers I‚Äôve tried new drivers. Old drivers still cause the black screen or will work find and then eventually just crash the computer. New drivers just completely brick it. Everything on my computer is up to date except for the BIOS which requires the battery to be in even with it plugged in. Obviously I haven‚Äôt put it back in for safety reasons. My conclusion is there is a more recent driver available that I‚Äôm unaware of or there is physical damage to the video card and needs replaced.¬†

I still have a year left on both my extended Depot Warranty and Accidental protection plan that I bought (glad I did) but Lenovo support has been giving me the run around. I‚Äôve called 3 times and have had practically no help. I just keep getting asked if I‚Äôve done all of the basic troubleshooting on the website which I have.¬†

Long post but I wanted to be as thorough as possible.¬†

Is bikeshare underrated?,"Does notjustbikes undervalue bikesharing? I feel like I don't hear about this much from him or others, but it seems like a great solution to concerns people (including me) have with biking.

* Bike theft (and bike theft anxiety) is eliminated with dockable bikes. You will never have to worry about your bike when you park at your destination for any period of time. 
* Flexibility is greatly increased. Maybe you want to bike somewhere in the evening, but take the train or Uber/Lyft back when it's late and you're tired. 
* Bikesharing now has e-bikes, which charge at their docks and are great. No need to go out of your way to charge you bike at home.
* Maintenance is handled by a company that knows how to maintain bikes - you don't need to do it yourself.
* Parking is a lot easier, because you know where docking stations are available. Also, if more people use bikeshare vs owning their own bikes, there's less need for parking overall (fewer bikes). This could help with the overcrowded bike parking in the Netherlands for example.
* Bike storage is no concern. You never need to carry your bike inside your apartment to store if you're going to be out of town for a week. 
* No upfront cost. Bike's aren't terribly expensive, but they do require a certain level of commitment to go out, choose a bike, and fork over the money. Alternatively, anyone can easily use a bikeshare for a low marginal cost to try it out and see if they like it.

I admit there are some downsides - the bikeshare system needs to be well maintained and have frequent docks to work well. But assuming a city is dense enough and invests in this well, it seems like an ideal solution. Am I missing something?

Note: my experience is based on CitiBikes in NYC.",notjustbikes,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/notjustbikes/comments/pc23bk/is_bikeshare_underrated/,,outletbox,pc23bk,/r/notjustbikes/comments/pc23bk/is_bikeshare_underrated/,https://www.reddit.com/r/notjustbikes/comments/pc23bk/is_bikeshare_underrated/,30,2021-08-26
An explanation of all the spam job ads posted by VITAL STANDARDS INC. and DICE CAROLINA and URBAN MILLENNIAL on Charleston job boards,"TL;DR... they are part of a notorious predatory MLM that has been in a perpetual state of name change since it was created in the late 70's so new recruits can not research the risks associated with this ""opportunity.""  Critics accuse this organization of using cult-like practices to isolate and financially exploit members.  Google SMART CIRCLE / CYDCOR / CREDICO for more info.

Hi Charleston!  These companies are really good at removing Google and Facebook reviews, so I figured I would post this to Reddit instead.  If you've found this post via Google, then you've probably been offered a job that seems too good to be true with an upstart marketing firm you've never heard of that promises they have Fortune 500 clients they can't tell you about.  The whole thing probably seemed suspicious, so you wanted to find more about the company, but... there wasn't much to find, beyond a bunch of pictures of young adults in fancy clothes hugging each other and pointing at the camera and begging you to come join them so you too can get rich.

Yeah, but... rich at doing what?  There's a lot of buzzwords about marketing and growth and development and expansion and how everyone is getting rich doing it... but they never seem to say what exactly ""it"" is..  Well, this is not an accident.  If you knew what they did, you would never reply to one of their mysterious BS help wanted ads that seem to be cut &amp; pasted onto every job board in every city around the world.  In fact, even if you go in for a job interview and begin working for them, they will not tell you what the job is or who you'll be working for.  If you knew their actual name, you'd be able to Google it and read how common these offices are and how they have an extremely well documented track of failure and financial exploitation.  

The job is... direct sales.  It includes door to door to sales of products or contracts for energy or telecom services, or standing around in big box retailers like Costco, Walmart or Target trying to hit up every passing customer.  But wait, you say... that doesn't sound like you'd get rich being a door-to-door make-up salesman, right?  Well no, they tell you... this step in the process won't get you rich... this is just the ""management training"" program meant to prepare you for being a CEO of your own corporation just like this one.  And THAT's the point at which you'll get rich.

You see... Once you master the high-pressure psychology-based door-to-door sales practices they use on customers, you'll then be trained to use them on new employees... because ultimately the employees ARE the customers.  They are buying into a system that promises to make them rich.  Is it a pyramid scheme or an MLM?  Depends on who you ask.  But it's entirely possible to sell the same products and services that they sell inside the business without ""the business.""  You can sell them on your own and keep 100 percent of your commission.  But if you agree to join ""the business"" you can pay half of those commissions into the system and the system will train you on how to convince others to do the same thing.  This is still a sales job, but now your job is to sell your job to a new employee who can in turn sell that job to their next recruit.  They call it ""replicating yourself"" and it is the only way to advance in the business.  Should you succeed in recruiting five new ""owners"" in the business, and those five ""owners"" can recruit five ""owners"" of their own, then you theoretically become a millionaire, living off passive income streams of all the downline sales reps in your pyramid-shaped business organization.

To accomplish their goal of locking people into this system, ""the business"" employees a variety of manipulative psychological practices that critics have accused of being cult-like.  The BITE model breaks these behaviors into categories like control of Behavior, Information, Thought and Emotion.  New recruits face severe restrictions on time, despite the fact that this is a commission based sales job.  In addition to working your full shift, five days a week, all employees must attend morning and evening meetings in which they hype each other up on how much they love the business and how dedicated they are to succeeding within it.  This includes chanting and singing and a daily bell ringing ceremony.  These are tactics used to fill a new recruit's time and blocking conscious thought by way of talking and memorization tasks.  Once a week, they have ""team night"" where after work they spend the whole night together, usually going bowling or eating buffalo wild wings or something they can afford to do as a group.  At night they have motivational ""one on one"" phone calls with others in the system.  They read internal magazines that feature nothing but testimonials about how the business saved them.  Negativity is strictly forbidden, and is defined as anything that will hurt your success of succeeding ""in the business.""  Sales reps are lucky to get one day off a week.  Owners typically get one day off a year -- Christmas.  

They are coached to believe they'll struggle at first, but will eventually become millionaires, and this imminent salvation justifies their present state of misery.  New recruits are frequently coached to move in with each other to help share living costs while they ""make it through the field"" and into ownership.  They're forced to spend weekends together on ""road trips"" where they're sent to another city (at their own expense) to help sell products on commission for another office whose numbers are struggling.  Friends and family have probably grown critical of this suspicious new company, and the business then forces a wedge between the new recruit and their support systems, forcing them to choose between their success in the business and their old lives of poverty and doubt (and by extension, their parents, friends and romantic partners).  But it will all be wroth it when, on one glorious day, they make it to ownership and start collecting their six-figure salaries.

But this never happens.  Instead, all the financial risk for opening a new office is shifted from the business to the owners -- both the new owner opening and offie and the ""promoting owner"" who has coached them through the field.  New reps are shown how to open a ""business account"" in which a portion of their commissions will be invested to help them save up enough money to cover the expenses of opening their own office.  Some of these expenses are ones that any business would face -- like rent or utilities -- but many of these charges are unique to ""the business"" and only circulate money back into its system.  For instance, a new owner will be told they will need an accountant to handle their finances, but no worries... the business can hook you up with your own independent accountant who also only happens to work for other owners like you within the business and is married to someone in the business.  Need social media management?  We got ya covered!  Need someone to post hundreds of job ads every day on your behalf to keep recruits coming in?  No worries, we got massive bulk purchases with CareerBuilder to hook you up with.  Need to submit your HR information so we can keep track of time and money?  Sure, just pay to download this new app we developed internally.  Oh yeah, and to run the app you'll need iPads but good news, we've got a great deal on some refurbished ones!!!  Broke owners quickly learn they must return to ""the field"" to continue direct selling if they hope to generate any profit for their new business.  So now they are full time sales people and full time recruiters.  

And so it's death by a thousand cuts as new owners (who are really kids who have no idea how to run businesses) are shuffled out into the world. They do not get to pick which cities they open their offices in.  As soon as an office closes, they'll send a new owner to take over that territory.  And the cycle repeats.  Sales in the field is governed by a LAW OF AVERAGES philosophy that says you have to burn through 100 customers to make one sale, and that same law of averages applies to the owners, who fail at a staggeringly high rate... easily 99 percent.  As their businesses start to flounder, they are loaned money by the owners above them to try and keep them from leaving the system.  Then, once their office is shut down, the owner is given the opportunity to return to the field and repeat the recruiting process in an attempt to work off debts to the business and earn another chance at opening an office.  People spend their lives gambling on this system, fall in love within it, raise families exclusively within the business because anyone outside of the business can not understand it or love it in the same way they do.

But the really sinister thing about it is how in order to succeed, owners must constantly recruit.  But in order to successfully recruit, they have to give off the impression that they're so happy and so successful that everyone they meet should leap at the opportunity to join them.  So while they're drowning in unexpected debts, hungry, exhausted, sequestered from friends and family across the country, and likely sharing a group home with coworkers, they must at all times pretend to be extremely happy and extremely successful because this is the only way they can ever hope to make any return on the massive investment of money, time and energy that they've made into the business.  

Obviously, a handful of people have gotten extremely rich in the business, and maybe this is the kind of opportunity that you're looking for, and if so, that's great.  But it is not the opportunity they describe in the job ads.  And it's not the opportunity they explain in the job interview process.  But you deserve to know what the job offer is before you schedule time off to go in for an interview or arrange a babysitter or quit another job for it.

AITA for throwing my BFs kids sandwich away?,"My BF has a 4yo who was recently diagnosed with ODD. He has always had behavioral problems, from what I'm told. I've only known him a little over a year and he definitely does have terror moments BUT I actually thought people were being overdramatic because he never appeared to be THAT bad (the way they described the behavior truly made sense because I never saw him act out terribly, only minor, and we have him 3 days a week). 

In light of his diagnosis I went and grabbed a bunch of behavioral books from the library to study up on and basically, from what I gathered, when a child acts out in a certain way when having ODD you are not supposed to play in to it because I guess its attention seeking and poor judgement. Not sure how accurate it is. I'm no doctor and I only read a couple books on it. Far from an expert by any means.

But anyways, BF left me with his boy to go to work this evening and my BFs mom stopped by to hang out for a few. I made him a sandwich for dinner, per his request, with a side of macaroni salad. I dont know why this happened or if perhaps his gram is a trigger because I've never seen him act out like this BUT he took his entire plate of food and tossed it on the floor before slamming the table repeatedly. At first I just gave the sandwich back (landed on top of the plate). Well.. he looked at me and tossed it back on the floor. This time face down. So I just walked over and tossed it in the garbage. Cue immediate meltdown. Hes freaking out, my BFs mom is freaking out. I wouldnt let him go to bed hungry but I wasnt about to make him a new sandwich right then and have him toss that one too. So I was going to just wait until he calmed down. But anyways bfs mom calls BF at work and tells him I just tossed the kids food out and my BF lost his shit and drove home and told me to leave.

How many weird little things do you do to set your dog up for success?,"I've been to people's houses where you had to close the pantry a certain way so the dog couldn't nose it open and eat everything. I know several people who have locking trash cans so their dogs don't go dumpster diving. 

As for me, personally? Should've named my boy after Kevin McCallister, because every time he's left home alone, he finds a new way to create mischief. 

It started with us leaving him in the main living area (crates were a health hazard for him) with all the doors closed so that he couldn't go off into another room. We made sure there was no food left out. No hazards. 

Then, he decided to knock over the trash can. He just wanted to sniff/lick stuff; he doesn't eat trash. So now when we leave, we put the trash can in another room. Then, when on my period, he started going through the bathroom trash. (Doesn't make me self conscious AT ALL.) He would just uncover my tampons and that was it. So now we shut the doors to the bathrooms whenever I'm on my period. My partner started to leave the dishwasher cracked open so that the dishes could dry better after the cycle. Today, he nosed his way into the dishwasher and took out several dishes to lick. So now we're not gonna do that.

Basically, I want to know if we're crazy for making all these little adjustments, or if we need to train around the behavior some other way.

The Harley &amp; The dishes (NSFW),"A guy named Joe heads into his local Harley Davidson dealership with a fistfull of dollars and starts looking for his dream motorbike. The dealer looks at Joe's choice and states that while Joe's choice in motorcycle was respectable, the older style Harleys not only held their value better, but in most cases they actually increased substantially in value. Joe decides to take the dealers advice and chooses the older model bike. 
Just as Joe finishes signing the paperwork, the dealer warns joe that these bikes are prone to rust and in order to for the classic Harley to retain its value, Joe would have to keep his purchase out of the rain.
Joe wasn't happy about this new information and explained that he had no garage at his home and the bike was going to be parked outside in the elements.  The dealer then assured Joe that there was a simple solution to this problem and proceeded to hand Joe a large jar of Vasoline. The dealer then explains to Joe, that he is to cover his bike in Vasoline if he suspects rain, and this would protect Joe's investment. Joe, happy with this solution , decides to accept the Vasoline and proceeds with the purchase of the bike.

Later that evening Joe rang his new girlfriend as they had a date night organised.
Joe pulled up to her house on his newly purchased vintage Harley and Joe's girlfriend was very impressed to say the least, she then proceeded to tell Joe that she had told her parents about her Joe and they were keen to meet him for dinner.
Joe agreed to the dinner, his girlfriend hopped on the back of the bike and they rode out to Joe's girlfiends parents house.
As the two lovebirds got off the bike and made their way toward the house, Joe's girlfriend stopped and said ""there's something I need to tell you. We have a rule in our house that nobody speaks during dinner or they have to do the dishes"".Joe laughed and agreed to the quirky stipulation.
Upon entering the house Joe could see what looked like a years worth of dishes piled up all through the house.
After exchanging pleasantries with the parents, they all sat down for dinner and sure enough not a word was spoken, for fear of being lumbered with the task of washing the dishes.
Halfway through dinner and still in silence Joe, being the rebellious type, plants a passionate kiss on his girlfriend. The parents don't look too thrilled but before they say anything, both look over to the pile of dishes and decide not to say anything and continue with their meals. 
Joe then, taking advantage of the situation, pulls out his chair, bends his girlfriend over, pulls her panties to the side and starts humping her at the table.
By this stage both parents are furious, they look at each other but before any of them act they look over toward the mass of unwashed dishes and decide to ignore what is happening.
Joe realizing he is in the middle of a once in a lifetime situation then pushes his girlfriend out of the way, clears a space on the table, grabs his girlfriend's mom and starts giving her the same treatment on the table much to the dismay of his girlfriend and her father.
Both the girlfriend and her father are now livid at what is happening in front of them but just as they are about to give Joe his marching orders both look toward the mountain of dishes and decide against saying anything.
Just as Joe is giving it to his girlfriend's mum, Joe catches a glimpse out of the window and sees rain drops.
The first thing Joe that comes to Joe's mind is his precious Harley Davidson and the potential damage the rain will do to his investment. With that in mind and in a heartbeat Joe casts his girlfriend's mother aside and grabs the Vasoline out of his pocket.
Just then his girlfriend's dad jumps out of his seat and says "" okay, okay, I'll do the fucken dishes"".",Jokes,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/pbwb8o/the_harley_the_dishes_nsfw/,Long,DaylightDave,pbwb8o,/r/Jokes/comments/pbwb8o/the_harley_the_dishes_nsfw/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/pbwb8o/the_harley_the_dishes_nsfw/,56,2021-08-26
so... here are my thoughts on lvl 112 story bits... oh dear.,"SPOILERS!! I talk about levels uhh... \~106 to 112 I think... I honestly don't have the energy to make the spoiler alert funny this time, I'm ***SO*** tired.

Quick note, I originally wrote this a while ago... I was just nervous to actually post it because I was worried I got too angry in it... but I had some momentum on giving my opinions on the plot as I got through it before and I want to talk about the arc that comes next and I didn't want to just skip all the levels I hadn't talked about yet so... HERE WE ARE! (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÅÔ∏ø‚Ä¢ÃÄÔΩ°)

&amp;#x200B;

I know why chapter 14 is titled ""Wrath""...

it's because the rage you will feel during this chapter burns with the power of a god damn supernova **VAPORIZING A GALAXY!!**

there is **nothing** that makes you wish you were playing literally anything else more than hearing Ming-Z-Lu say ""Only Luminous can save Erii!"" meanwhile your character has just gone catatonic in the middle of an important scene, and the game hammers home that LUMINOUS ISN'T GOING TO SAVE ERII DESPITE HIM BEING THE ""ONLY ONE WHO CAN""

...f\*ckin bullsh\*t

I'm just gonna apologize in advance, I get extremely pissed a bit later on... I'm sorry...

\------

As you've probably guessed, by the title and... the opening, I got to level 112. and I was actually enjoying the story again! I was completely invested, rip Chisei, Chime and Erii, poor beans deserved better TT \^ TT, sure I felt like MC wasn't doing nearly enough but that's how it always is... however, clearly... some of this stretch of story made me *quite* angry.

but before I get to that I'm just going to jump back in time a little bit to talk about LVL 106 because I find the ending of it to be very cheap. Basically at the end Ruri Kazama lunges to stab Chisei and MC jumps in to try and stop Ruri but MC ends up phasing right through him and Ruri stabs Chisei anyway. I'm not even sure Ruri could *see* MC when they jumped at him... it was a cool moment and it did it's job to make me feel helpless and/or useless... but it was really out of the blue and didn't line up with what I thought I understood about the dream world. I thought that I couldn't interact with or change the dream... but Ruri, who was in control of the dream because it was his EX, was FULLY able to interact with and affect *me* while I was *in* the dream... because he was controlling it... AND HE PUT ME THERE-! I tried to think of an interesting dream sequence to reference but I just couldn't think of one... other than it's just the teeniest, tiniest, little bit like Inception.

In the scene where you follow ghost Chisei. You get a part of the brothers' backstory, Ruri Kazama shows up and talks to you and I *think* he attacks you...? (it's been a hot minute since I actually played it so my memory is a *bit* **~~VERY~~** fuzzy) if we couldn't interact with Ruri at all like how it is during the *end* of the dream sequence... that scene doesn't work anymore. And don't try to excuse it as Ruri changed the rules at the end because that is a HUGE cop-out... and an *especially* lazy one that accidentally makes things SUPER convoluted, confusing and annoying. sometimes, you kind of gotta choose one, you can't have both or things will get unnecessarily complicated because you didn't want to give your badass OP boi a possible weakness other characters could logically take advantage of. it's either you can't interact with Ruri and miss out on a lot of exposition or you *can* interact with Ruri and change the story so MC *can* stop Ruri from killing Chisei at the very end... make it a QTE or a dialogue choice or something. it honestly felt like the game was saying:

""You wanted to mean something to the plot by drastically changing the course of the original story because your *mere* presence is an impossible anomaly that could logically do that? lol nope, you only get to save ***one*** character and even *then* it's vague whether or not you even *can.* Hahaha- **feed me money.**""

That's... not what I want to be thinking when playing a game. I honestly don't think it would be that hard to change this part of the story, sure you'd have to forfeit having the Dragon King Herzog fight and only fight regular Herzog but I feel like that would actually be much more satisfying... for MC's story at least. plus if you *really* still wanted a climactic fight against a big monster you could have him become massively unstable all of a sudden and it wouldn't even be some kind of gigantic leap in logic. Herzog was trying to *become* a dragon, right? you could write it so that he was already like, halfway through the transformation and the only way to complete it was to use Erii. ^((if you want some edgy sh\*t you could say something like: ""he transformed, he wasn't human anymore, but he wasn't a dragon either... he was a monster, bent on nothing but destruction and bloodshed!"")) idk tho... it was just annoying and easily fixable in my head. ^((again, I wrote this a while ago, I came up with Death Servitor Herzog right after this.))

in retrospect I was kind of disappointed that they didn't end up having a scene where Ruri changes the dream world to reflect *MC's* memories for a short period of time, and give some extra backstory, maybe show the Black Swan Bay fam having fun like, having a snowball fight or something... just something that would throw MC off their game and make them sad or angry. They showed that Ruri's EX definitely *could* do something like that with the intro leading *into* the dream world where the Cassel crew was there and ""dead"" and Vera and Renata were there in their Dreamy Aurora outfits. if his EX *couldn't* see into the target's memories and fears and stuff that moment wouldn't have been possible since even though Ruri knew MC grew up in Black Swan Bay there's no way he knew any distinct details about the people that MC grew up *with* there without a *little* bit of mind reading. He wasn't in the orphanage, at least not at the same time as MC and if he was they were never in contact with one another, plus if I take one of Herzog's lines during his monologue at face value, the orphanage was mostly just for defective experiments so Chime *definitely* wouldn't have been there if he was... and I'm pretty sure the lore is that Bondarev took Chisei and Chime from the *lab* when they were smol so... correct me if I have something wrong here, cause I wouldn't be surprised if I did. I honestly would've liked to see Chisei's reaction if he got swept up into it too, I wonder how he'd react if Ruri recreated the bombing of Black Swan Bay just to try and make MC lower their guard out of surprise or fear or something... would Chisei feel bad? an event like this would've showed just how cruel Ruri Kazama can be since it seems like he's *supposed* to be this merciless and destructive alter ego to soft boi Chime, but they don't really show it at all... of course, I don't really know what he's *supposed* to be, anyway.

Jumping out of my imagination to something that's relatively canon, if we're looking at the story from a Hero's Journey type structure with MC as the protagonist it's like the story skipped a few steps and jumped straight to the belly of the whale or the darkest moment which would usually be right in the middle of the story and/or towards the end, there can be more than one but they're usually at least a *little* bit later on. looking at it from *Luminous'* perspective, however, it would fit pretty well. from what I know, it's relatively smack dab in the middle of his story... the reason I think I feel angry at this current moment is because it's WAY too early in *MC's* story to have a moment as dark and depressing as the death of three major characters, we already had Black Swan Bay as a really dark and tragic inciting incident but you need to let MC start to find happiness before you can crush their hopes and dreams!... *wow...* that sounded a lot more mean than I intended... I have *no* sympathy for the characters I write do I-? moving on.

The not-so-subtle foreshadowing of Osho still being alive payed off really well and he got a very dramatic reentrance and I'm not gonna lie it was really cool and effective. I love me a good evil for the sake of power villain that's done well. I felt *very* angry at him, and, despite my mild frustration with being unable to stop it, I felt Chisei's death really hard because *Chime* was so sad about it. Though the plot twist that Osho was actually *also* Masamune Tachibana felt... kind of odd- at first at least... and less ""odd"" more confusing. the more I think about it and the more I actually *learned* about this twist the more I think it's interesting and the more sense it starts to make but still, it seemed like it was only really there for a ""-gasp!- whaat!?"" moment... and I didn't really know if I liked it or not at first because it... isn't explained as well as it *could be* in game. in my opinion the worst part of this twist specifically with the game in mind is that it makes it even *more* annoying that Masamune did not show ***ANY*** sign of recognition or surprise when he saw MC at the *start* of the Japan arc. and if he *did* recognize MC, dude is *upsettingly* good at hiding it... or the writers didn't know what the twists were so they didn't think to leave any hints or they weren't allowed to add any extra dialogue or animation. 

Even though they literally could've had a non voice acted cut between closeups of the faces of MC and Masamune while using idle animations with dialogue as complex as: Masamune Tachibana: ""...!!"" MC: ""...?"" and I would've been happy.

^((take a moment to breathe, cause sh\*t's about to hit the fan, I'm sorry once again. this paragraph is why I procrastinated on posting this.))

now... I can forgive most of that... because it was (mostly) executed well and I really enjoyed it! it was all going well... until the cut to Luminous... **OOH** ***BOY,*** **DO I HAVE SOME SH\*T TO SAY ABOUT THE CUT TO LUMINOUS!**

**I HAVE** ***NEVER*** **BEEN MORE UPSET WITH THIS GAME'S STORY CHOICES.** first issue I have: they seem to have forgotten that MC was, presumably, STILL IN THE WELL OF BONES DURING THE CUT BECAUSE MING-Z BASICALLY MADE MC PASS OUT TO FORCE THEM INTO SPECTATING LUMINOUS SULKING BECAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE HE CAN'T TELEPORT THEM AND **LUMINOUS** ***CANNOT SEE MC*** **SO THEY'RE** ***OBVIOUSLY*** **NOT PHYSICALLY PRESENT!!!** The intense, high stakes situation just a few seconds prior legitimately had my heart racing! I was in it! Ready to beat the ever loving sh\*t out of Herzog in a climactic and cathartic battle... and then suddenly... MC blacked out... and Ming-Z-Lu was like, ""Let's go get my brother together!"" and then all of a sudden the plot pulled to a **GRINDING** halt as I was forced to sit and watch Luminous wallowing in self pity... and for some reason I couldn't do anything, I would have been able to forgive this ENTIRE cut away if I was at least able to kick Luminous' ass into high gear so he'd get to the Well of bones in time to rescue someone, BUT NOO I JUST HAVE TO *SIT AND WATCH,* ***USELESSLY!*** WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST LET MC EXPERIENCE THE SH\*T GOING DOWN IN THE WELL OF BONES ON THEIR OWN!? THEY WERE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF STOPPING HERZOG AND FOR SOME F\*CKING REASON THEY WEREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO ***TRY!!!*** I WOULD'VE PREFERED A F\*CKING GLORIFIED CUTSCENE FIGHT WITH HERZOG WHERE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU HIT HIM HE DOESN'T DIE AND YOU'RE *SUPPOSED* TO HIT 0 HP AND YOU END UP LIKE... HALF CONSCIOUS OR SOMETHING DURING HERZOG'S TRANSFORMATION AND ERII AND CHIME'S DEATHS, THAT WOULD'VE AT LEAST GIVEN AN ***EXPLANATION*** AS TO WHY MC COULDN'T DO ANYTHING... **AND I USUALLY HATE THAT KIND OF SH\*T!!** there are... *so* many other ways that this part could've gone, and *this* is the way that it went! usually when I write anger in these things it's just over exaggerated and played up for comedic effect but I am *legitimately* upset with this sh\*t. it's VERY telling that I would have *preferred* a lazy cop-out that even REMOTELY kept MC as an active character rather than what was actually put into the game. the worst part is that IT'S JUST SO *BORING!!* WATCHING A CHARACTER DO NOTHING BUT WHINE AND B\*TCH ABOUT HOW WEAK AND USELESS THEY ARE WHILE DOING **NOTHING** TO TRY AND *CHANGE* THEIR USELESSNESS IS NOT GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL ANY SORT OF SYMPATHY FOR THAT CHARACTER I'M JUST GOING TO THINK THEY'RE ANNOYING!! ***ESPECIALLY*** IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE I WAS PULLED AWAY FROM AN ACTUALLY COMPELLING AND INTERESTING PART OF THE STORY AND FORCED TO DEAL WITH THAT SH\*T!! NOT TO MENTION IT HAS **NOTHING** TO DO WITH MC IN ANY CAPACITY OTHER THAN ""They're just there because reasons."" IT'S JUST... F\*CKING INFURIATING AND COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY!! IF THERE IS ONE THING THAT HAS MADE ME LEGITIMATELY WANT TO DELETE THIS GAME MID STORY **IT'S THIS!!** phew... sorry... I got a lot more heated than I usually do... I'm sorry... gotta calm down so I don't start screaming again.

I did think the final battle with Herzog was cool...*looking.* it was a bit confusing as to what was actually going on story-wise and I found the actual gameplay part of it *very* confusing but that's beside the point- and what am I doing talking about gameplay, I'm the story over-analysis and rage girl I don't talk about *gameplay* you're here to listen to me get angry and try to sound like I know what I'm talking about! the actual battle and cutscenes for the fight didn't really make me feel like *I* got to have my catharsis with Herzog and there was no conclusion to MC's personal ties and issues with him so it really didn't *feel* very climactic or rewarding... probably because *Z* was the one doing all the canonical fighting. I actually really like the meta af bit where Z talked about the literal book and that MC is the one thing that's really different about this version of the world because it was relatively entertaining... and I could only start thinking that he brought MC to the lab way back in Black Swan Bay and found a way to save them after they fell into the sea in an attempt to get MC to be the drastic timeline-altering force that they were meant to be because he already knew about the book and maybe he's trapped in some kind of time loop where he's jumping timelines to try and find the best ending and-... but I'm probably overthinking it.

I... *think* they got rid of the unstable hybrid character trait while giving us a vague, ""you *might* be able to revive Erii, you might not, give us more of your heart, soul, and time and *maybe* you'll find out!"" I *really* don't know if I like that. on one hand it saves the writers from dealing with figuring out what the hell the story does with the genuine repercussions of the unstable MC and makes it so that there's no reason to put any more focus on MC and their flimsy in-game character, but on the other hand it was built up so *well* that to have it go nowhere is just... unsatisfying... and there's no reason to put any more focus on MC-. One of the most interesting ideas (in my opinion) that were thrown into MC was that they were highly unstable, there's so much wasted potential by just handwaving that away! though that might be the unpopular opinion on this topic. I may not know what the rules are *exactly,* and I am one to *bend* rules a bit, but there's a difference between bending and breaking... and then there's straight up ignoring but that doesn't have anything to do with this conversation. it just doesn't make any sense that all of a sudden MC is ""no longer unstable"" because they accepted *more* dragon blood... if this were following the one thing I actually thought I understood this should actually make MC **MORE** unstable! I know it's like, ""Pure dragon blood"" or ""Special dragon blood"" or something like that- I know a cop-out when I see one and I'm getting *really* f\*cking tired of all the cop-outs in MC's part of the story... IT'S BASICALLY ***MADE*** OF COP-OUTS AT THIS POINT. the fact that MC is an unstable hybrid never actually had any kind of repercussions or consequences, they built it up as this super serious, dangerous trait that could lead to MC becoming a monster or getting the Hydra clan (and possibly Cassel itself) on their case but then it never goes *anywhere* it could've lead up to a *really* dark moment but they just... dropped it! it seems like there's no actual original content for MC in the main plot and someone panicked because they weren't sure what to do with MC at the end there and decided to just use the first idea that came to mind and make it seem dramatic...

also... at some point there was no more dubbing for Herzog's lines. I mean, fair, the character *was* about to die but usually you don't just stop dubbing because the character is about to not be relevant anymore. I will, *partially,* forgive it because voice actors cost money and they probably saw a chance to save money, blah blah blah, whatever. the subtitles were decipherable but... a little awkward as usual.

they just sort of skipped how MC got out of the Well of Bones (annoying, wasted potential, I'm just repeating myself at this point) and jumped straight to farewells... they were good, Caesar said something a little uncomfortable but alright... it ended on a bittersweet note... I don't have too much to say about the actual ending of the Japan Arc as a whole, I liked it, it was good.

when it comes to making me genuinely uncomfy on a scale of 1 to being forced to watch the Twilight Saga against my will, the japan arc was like a 6; I was pretty invested and having a good time for most of it but it had it's moments where I *really* wanted to recede into my stomach and stay there... and they were a *little* too frequent. honestly the whole arc was really good from what I can remember, but y'know, there's a lot of empty space (-cough cough- grinding) where there easily could've been more story time to fill it in, but they cut the story into the most important chunks and stuck them together and... it was just a bit awkward and it made everything feel kind of incomplete, I think I've said that before though. but idk, I haven't seen anything past leaving japan; it could get better, it could get worse, I'll find out eventually.

I hope I didn't sound angry to the point where this wasn't fun to read... it was surprisingly difficult to write anything lighthearted when I was so genuinely mad... and it was also tough to try and lighten the anger. every time I went to proofread the paragraph about the Luminous cut I ended up adding *more* and getting *angrier* about it... and I bet that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE ELSE thought it was as infuriating as I did and I just look like I got mad for no apparent reason. &gt;w&lt;

I... don't really know how to end this... so, uhh... sorry?",DragonRajaMobile,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonRajaMobile/comments/pcb08t/so_here_are_my_thoughts_on_lvl_112_story_bits_oh/,Discussion,Kikicocobell,pcb08t,/r/DragonRajaMobile/comments/pcb08t/so_here_are_my_thoughts_on_lvl_112_story_bits_oh/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonRajaMobile/comments/pcb08t/so_here_are_my_thoughts_on_lvl_112_story_bits_oh/,4,2021-08-26
A Year Post-Divorce - My Verbal Unloading,"This is a way for me to help myself word-vomit but also remember.  Because I forget how far I've come.

I was with my ex-husband for 23 years.  He's an alcoholic and pot addict.  I supported him through everything - I essentially gave up myself to support the kids, the house, him.  He lost every job he had, he was a money pit, a cheater, verbally abusive and just not a good spouse or father for a long time at the end.  The stress got so bad I fell ill (pre-covid) and thought I was in heart failure.  I wasn't.  It was all stress.  Abuse &amp; addiction are GDamn mindF\*ks.  

He ended up in rehab and me in Alanon - which if you love an addict is life changing (or was for me).  19 months ago he moved out, the pandemic began &amp; he quickly asked me for a divorce.  I was inconsolable and just so deeply hurt at a soul deep level.  Felt invisible, worthless.  I had to maintain the house, homeschool the kids, pay all the bills and work.  I felt that he threw me away like trash - I was utterly disposable &amp; not worth it .  He trotted off to go enjoy his addiction, women and his lack of responsibilities.  It was the worst thing I have gone through emotionally so far in my life.  A year ago I was sobbing all the time.  I had nothing to talk about BUT the divorce.  The pain.

A year later - he's got a woman he's moving in with - this was a massive set back for me in many ways b/c again it just cut me real deep.  Why her and not me?  Why is SHE worth the time &amp; effort but me and your kids were not?  It's like I can't get far enough away to see my reality.  Because he is not a prize.  He hasn't magically improved or changed.  I am GLAD she is there to keep him stable, she has been nothing but kind to me &amp; the kids and I hope he treats her better than me.  But also F him.  why does HE get to have no repercussions?  (this is perception &amp; not reality)

BUT a year later I AM happier, healthier and even wealthier without him.  I took two vacations, redecorated my bedroom, bought myself a better used car &amp; paid off some debt.  I feel like myself.  My heart palpitations stopped.  I've lost a minor amount of weight.  I've been able to watch TV shows he would have ridiculed me for.  I enjoy being in my house, when I didn't always before.  I'm no longer anxious when he's 20 minutes late wondering if he ran out of gas yet again.  I'm no longer looking at the 17 pages of texts he was sending to women or 5 pages of phone calls lying to myself that he wasn't cheating b/c he was home every night...unless he was at ""soccer practice"".  I really didn't want to face the reality of any of it.

A year later - I do still care about him and have some kind of love for him?  He's just a flawed human being - like all of us - and he will always be the father of my kids.  It still hurts me, but I am not crying,  I'm not sad all the time.  I'm still stuck in the emotional pain, but the giant pull of it all is more behind me than in front of me and I KNOW the next 23 years of my life will nothing like the previous 23.  

For all of you still in the thick of the pain, it's horrible.  I know it.  Stay the course.  Look forward and not back as best you can.  Don't obsess over it forever.  Get help.  Date yourself.  I know I've come far this past year, I know I will only heal more this next year.

"It's useless, it's all useless!","Dame da. Ze~n zen dame da. There's no way this tragedy was caused by a witch!

I flaired this as a Sotsugyou spoiler, but beware that if you read between the lines, this could also spoil Umineko for you.

I'm going to present a Blue Truth that explains what happens without magic or witches.  This is important, because one of the current theories is that a lot of what we've been seeing has been the Illusion of the Witch.  This latest episode seems to push really hard to validate that everything was actually caused by a witch.  On the contrary, though, it actually just solidified that we're seeing the Illusion of the Witch, and gave us tools with which to expose it for what it is.

We now have two contradictory accounts of Teppei's murder. Presumably the magic explanation would be magic being used to temporarily revive Teppei so he can attack Keiichi.  That's ridiculous. There's no way something like magic or witches could exist.  We can immediately rule out this possibility.  This means that either Satoko didn't kill Teppei, or Teppei didn't attack Keiichi - or both.

Let's examine Satoko's account of Teppei's murder first.  In this one, it's blatantly obvious that we're being lied to.  There's no such thing as witches or magic, so any scenes that take place within the Sea of Fragments are at best meta commentary about what's happening. However, since in this case it's shown to interact with the real world, it's clearly a lie.  The rest of the account must be a lie too, though.  Unless she's a witch that has been looping repeatedly, Satoko in this Fragment has no motive for murdering Teppei.  She also has no motive for acquiring a firearm.  If the Tokarev is a lie, the entire scene revolving around it is a lie too.  As such, the entire scene as presented is a lie.  

Keiichi's account is more reasonable.  Nothing immediately stands out as requiring magic - Teppei had motive to protect his house and niece from someone who, for all he knew, was there to disappear them for Watanagashi.  This is possible, but evidence for other explanations points to this being a lie as well.

Ooishi was experiencing late-stage symptoms Hinamizawa Syndrome, acquired naturally *exactly as Ryukishi07 stated.* Hinamizawa Syndrome has been explained and demonstrated in detail throughout the series to the point where it's something the viewer is familiar with, so using it as a mechanism is not a violation of Knox's 4th.  He isn't the only person experiencing symptoms, though - Satoko is as well.  The fact that she was starting to experience symptoms is the very reason she desperately tried to get help from her only remaining family, and it's also why he was the only person she felt that she could trust.  The hint is extremely subtle, but it comes from Rika - *""Satoko went to go shopping for dinner.""*  We know how the town of Hinamizawa tends to treat Satoko.  The DEEN anime went out of its way to insert an anime-only arc about it to make certain we knew very well about it since it was relevant.  It's something Satoko has doubtless been dealing with the entire time, and she's certainly gone shopping before, but the thing to keep in mind is that this is right around Watanagashi, which is also the time she lost her parents, and then two years later her Nii-nii.  Satoko is **always** suffering Hinamizawa Syndrome symptoms.  They're usually managed pretty well with C-130, but it's still possible for sufficient stress to overwhelm it.  If she was already thinking about having lost her Nii-nii the previous year and got cold-shouldered just the right way by the townsfolk, it could very easily result in a relapse.  She then ended up spending some time with Teppei, who had begun trying to turn his life around and improve his relationship with her *on his own*.  

Slight tangent here - there being no such thing as witches or magic means that Satoko's ""looping"" had nothing to do with Teppei's change of character.  There are a few reasons this might have happened, from a breakup with Rina, to a mid-life crisis, to seeing a father and daughter smiling and laughing together.  It's probably a combination of all of these.  In any case, he realized for himself that he had been a shitty person and lost everything that was important to him, and that realization has caused him to start trying to be a less shitty person in the hopes of not losing any more - even though he realizes for himself that the stuff he did would seem objectively unforgivable.

Let's get back on track, though.  To Satoko experiencing Hinamizawa Syndrome symptoms, who believes that the town of Hinamizawa is her enemy, only another Houjou who the town would also antagonize can be trusted.  She broke down and vented her fears, delusional as they were, to Teppei, who believed her and immediately decided to help her.  Rather than intentionally deceiving Teppei into believing that the town was against her, it was simply Teppei's trust and faith in Satoko running into her paranoid delusions caused by Hinamizawa Syndrome.  When you expect there to be a conspiracy, it's easy to find circumstantial evidence for it even if it isn't there, and this is what happened to Teppei - the stares from the townfolk who couldn't believe that Teppei would come back would certainly seem to validate Satoko's claims of being harassed, and Ooishi would only make it worse.

Hinamizawa Syndrome also explains Satoko's behavior at school.  Leaving to go home at the very first opportunity as soon as class is over?  We know at least 3 other people who have done the same thing with similar excuses.  Staying home?  Fevers, fatigue, and malaise are also symptoms of Hinamizawa Syndrome.  Satoko was legitimately sick - or she was paranoid enough of her classmates at this point to fake it to Teppei.  Keiichi experienced the same thing.  She felt better the next day and tried going back to school, and was immediately greeted by all of her friends showing great concern and being worried about her.  That's not what she saw, though.  Think back to Onikakushi-hen.  Remember all the times when Rena or Mion laugh maniacally at Keiichi?  If you know the truth about Onikakushi-hen, you know that didn't happen.  They were, in fact, sobbing.  Hallucinations from Hinamizawa Syndrome can twist this legitimate concern from your loved ones into something that seems much more sinister.  Everyone's concern over her living with Teppei transformed in her head into them bullying her for reconciling with him, or even threatening her for trying to get help.  If Ooishi's Hinamizawa Syndrome being natural was the *truth* in that interview, then Satoko's breakdown being an act is the *lie*.  

The scene where Teppei begged Ooishi for help was the truth.  Much of what happened when he came to investigate the house was also the truth.  It's possible that Satoko drugged the tea out of Hinamizawa Syndrome induced paranoia - we've seen similar inexplicable behavior before.  It's also possible that it wasn't tea in the first place.  A TIPS in Watanagashi-hen shows Ooishi sharing a beer with the hooligans who were antagonizing Keiichi right in the police station.  Having a couple beers or some sake with Teppei isn't off the table.  It doesn't really matter what held Ooishi up, or if he even actually fell asleep. Him getting injected with H-173 was a lie. He was probably already starting to experience Hinamizawa Syndrome symptoms, and two Houjous desperately asking him for help with something that by all means sounds like it's going to be related to the cases he's obsessed with didn't help.  Of course, Ooishi doing everything he could to tarnish Teppei's appearance is also the truth.  

Now we'll get to the actual circumstances behind Teppei's murder.

Ooishi stated that he would watch the Houjou household on the night of Watanagashi.  So, basically, he's on a stakeout.  When you're on a stakeout, there's basically nothing to do.  This is 1983.  There are no cellphones to pass the time.  He could have been reading, but knowing other people who have suffered Hinamizawa Syndrome symptoms, it seems more likely that he's just there stewing in his thoughts.  This is, of course, exactly how Hinamizawa Syndrome creates a positive feedback loop that causes a very rapid increase in symptoms once a certain threshold is reached.  And that happened.  One thing that Hinamizawa Syndrome does is that it twists motives, and it can swap the means for the end.  He wants the Sonozakis to make a move.  He wants it so bad that it stops mattering to him whether they actually make a move - just whether he can justify going after them.  This twists, as we've seen many times, into him deciding to act out Oyashiro-sama's curse himself.

Now unstable, he went inside and murdered Teppei. Satoko shooting Teppei may have been a lie, but that doesn't mean he wasn't shot.  We can't confirm either way since we haven't had a Detective investigate the body, but it's entirely possible that Ooishi just walked straight in and shot Teppei.  It isn't clear whether he actually brutalized Teppei's body, but that's the one thing that's consistent across both accounts, so it probably happened.  It isn't clear how it goes from here, but there's a few things that could have happened.  Teppei might have been leaving when he saw Satoko and Keiichi entering the house.  Why would Satoko bring Keiichi to the house if she was convinced that all of her friends were her enemies?  Maybe she had the same ""realization"" as Ooishi, that Keiichi actually thought he was legitimately helping her, but he was being duped by the rest of Hinamizawa.  Keiichi is not a part of the Hinamizawa that's trying to ruin her life.  He just moved here.  He even acted like her brother for a while.  Maybe he can be some help to her as well?  **She brought him home to show him first-hand that Teppei was not abusing her.**  But Keiichi walked in on a grizzly murder scene.  Ooishi had seen them entering, though, and followed them inside.  Keiichi didn't even have time to react to what he saw before getting a bat to the back of the head, which immediately knocked him out.  Ooishi either assumed that he was dead, or figured that knocking him out was good enough.  Satoko either escaped or hid.  Ooishi was probably at level 5 at this point, it isn't clear whether he would notice or care that he didn't get Satoko.  Satoko probably tried to help Keiichi before leaving, but since she's basically an ordinary schoolgirl, that probably consisted of panicking, shaking him to try to get him to react, then fleeing.  Maybe she's fleeing to try and get help.  Maybe she also went L5 and just *ran*, and the festival is just where she ended up at.

Emergency Manual 34 was not activated.  This could be because Takano was already in the process of turning herself into Tokyo.  It's also possible that there was no conspiracy in the first place.  It's likely that the reason Satoko never visited Keiichi at the hospital is because *she has been hospitalized herself* with terminal Hinamizawa Syndrome symptoms.  It's also a possibility that she's been taken into protective custody by CWS after witnessing all of that.

No witch had anything to do with these events.  There is no magic.  There are no witches.  This is just a sad tale about misunderstandings.  There is no concept of winners and losers in this world - *everyone* loses.  There is no enemy to blame.",Higurashinonakakoroni,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Higurashinonakakoroni/comments/pcbiqb/its_useless_its_all_useless/,[Higurashi Sotsu Spoiler],Jerl,pcbiqb,/r/Higurashinonakakoroni/comments/pcbiqb/its_useless_its_all_useless/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Higurashinonakakoroni/comments/pcbiqb/its_useless_its_all_useless/,17,2021-08-26
AITA for not forgiving my dad's gf," My parents announced their divorce during my second pregnancy. I took the divorce extremely hard.
3 weeks after I had my child my dad told me &amp; my sisters that he was going to be bringing his new gf to my aunt's cottage and would love for us to meet her.She was holding my newborn &amp; we were all getting along when my DD started crying because she was hungry. I took my child so I could feed her. After I left the gf told my aunt that she thought I was upset that she was holding my baby. I never once stated anything like that.
1 mo later I was scrolling through her FB &amp; found out my dad was actually seeing her before he even told my mom that he wanted to get a divorce. I confronted both of them saying I do not agree with that lifestyle. We fought over it and my aunt talked with me and said I should forgive and move on. Which I did.
Then there were snide remarks over Netflix profiles and 1 of my sister's changed his profile and didn't put her name on the profile. My dad sent us an angry text saying we need to stop being so childish and that we were making gf feel unwelcomed. Again I stated I had nothing to do with it but she needed to grow up if she felt that way. 
Over Thanksgiving I invited her out to a family fun day while we were all together. She declined stating ""she wasn't going to be back from coffee in time"". I never gave her the time we were going out because it was subject to change.
Mydad told us he was moving across the country and buying a house with her. I stated that I didn't agree with the move and that it hasn't even been a year yet and things are moving too fast. How I wanted him to be around.The gf sent us a text afterwards &amp; stated that we are always welcomed in their life &amp;home. None of us responded as what we had to say was between our dad &amp; us. A month or so later I posted a meme on Facebook which stated ""have you ever opened a text and said wtf"". It had nothing to do with her. She proceeded to comment that we aren't nice and block all of us. She then went to my dad who yelled at us once again for not accepting her. She also turned to my aunt's,uncle's, and grandmother saying we are mean &amp; don't want my dad happy.  I returned a text and was not very nice but pointed out that we've done everything we could to accept her and that our dad should leave her because all she wants is to create issues. I also had severe postpartum depression during this time.
It's been 2 years since I have spoken or interacted with her. My aunts and siblings have all asked me to move forward.
My dad has asked if she could attend my son's birthday party with her. I stated no she could not attend the party. He proceeds to tell me that I need to accept that they are a couple and if she wasn't allowed he wasn't going. I told him the only person he would be punishing by not attending would be my child and due to my own mental health I don't want her around.

"Long time reader, first time poster","So I‚Äôve been in here reading everybody‚Äôs stories and I just have to say I feel relieved! Granted not everybody‚Äôs situation is the same but at least I don‚Äôt feel alone any more. Thank you for all that share!

It‚Äôs hard when you are told that your life, marriage and family HAVE to be one way but you can‚Äôt seem to find satisfaction in the social norm. That you feel like a failure when you veer off course.

My situation is more complex than others but I know I‚Äôm not unique and I‚Äôm not trying to sell it as though I am. I‚Äôm currently married to my SO and we have been together for 7 years. She is what I call my ‚Äúlight‚Äù side. She is my best friend, my partner and one of very few people I can rely on. I love her with almost all of my heart.

My AP and I have had a 13 year ongoing relationship. She is my best friend, she inspires me, she is my muse. We relate on so many levels. But because of our own complications, we‚Äôve never really been able to have a go at a real relationship. Not sure if I would want it if I could. She is a part of my ‚Äúdark‚Äù side. I love her with almost all of my heart.

So why am I fractured like this? Idk.. maybe childhood trauma, maybe self-esteem and control issues, again I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve tried to hide from my dark side, run from it, attended church and begged to be healed from it but I can‚Äôt get rid of it, it‚Äôs my sin and cross to bear.  I know it‚Äôs a part of who I am, no matter what I do.

If I only had the two pieces of my heart to stay fulfilled maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad. But my dark side yearns for more. Always more! Now I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm a pig guy and am just trying to justify having sex with a bunch of women, that isn‚Äôt what satiates me. It‚Äôs more about verbal connection with women, additional eAP partners. I‚Äôm a collector of thoughts and secrets and I love feeling that connection too. Which is why I also have 2 other eAP partners and still look for more.

I don‚Äôt like this part about me. I definitely feel broken but it‚Äôs also that part that makes me feel alive. I‚Äôm not young, I don‚Äôt have small children at home any more. I‚Äôm free to leave or do as I wish, nothing ties me to my SO other than I truly do love her. But as hard as she tries, she will never be able to bridge the fracture in my heart. So I continue to be the best husband I can be and live with my dark side as safely as possible so that I don‚Äôt ruin the lives of my SO or AP.

Again, thank you for letting me share and thank you for all those too that have shared.",adultery,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/pc1xqq/long_time_reader_first_time_poster/,,Street_Feeling6417,pc1xqq,/r/adultery/comments/pc1xqq/long_time_reader_first_time_poster/,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/pc1xqq/long_time_reader_first_time_poster/,10,2021-08-26
Hurricane season in the midst of COVID-19 part 2,"Here we go again. Hurricane season, while COVID still ravages our country. And guess where hurricanes are most likely to hit, but the states where covid rates are higher, and deniers are rampant. My family heavily believes the crap that is preached on social media. Masks for against our freedoms, the vaccine is a way to control us, COVID isn't that bad. I'm not here to debate on it. Just saying they believe in the typical stuff. 

I'm vaccinated, my husband's vaccinated. My children are not. 

Watching the trends in this new hurricane in the gulf.... it's going to hit my family's area. There's a possibility that they will have to evacuate...they may even guilt trip me into allowing them to come here to my home up north. 

But...

My youngest brother tested positive. My other brother and his wife also had COVID. I'm 100% sure that, although my parents and my sister haven't been tested, they have been exposed and possibly infected. I'm not sure what to do. I'm afraid to stand up and say no... because I know my narcissist mother will make me out to be the bad guy and will speak badly of me to my siblings. I don't want them to cut me out and stop talking to me. Despite their terrible opinions, I still love them and they are my everything. If something bad happened to them... it'd be my fault. 

I can't put my family at risk...but I can't tell my parents and siblings to fuck off either. Laura was terrible last year. My brother lost his home. My parents are *still* dealing with the fallout. My only hope is that they will find a place to go to on their own. 

They can't come here. They can't. My husband can't miss work, my daughter can't miss school. We can't allow them to infect us and possibly harm us. That's what I've decided. But I'm so afraid of how they'll respond. 

I'll be watching the local news stations and see if there's an evacuation order. If there is....I'll try to steel myself for the call. And I will say ""I'm sorry...but we can't have you here...."" Not with the recent COVID infection. Not with my brothers testing positive. My mom can say that they aren't testing positive but I know for sure that she's lied about it before. She's denied having it when everyone in the house had it last year. She didn't get an antibody test because she didn't believe in it. 

I just need help and reassurance. I can't deal with anything right now. I'm so afraid for them and their safety... I'm anxious about my decision and how they'd respond. I don't want them to abandon me....",breakingmom,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/pc10f6/hurricane_season_in_the_midst_of_covid19_part_2/,family rant üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß,Tibbersbear,pc10f6,/r/breakingmom/comments/pc10f6/hurricane_season_in_the_midst_of_covid19_part_2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/pc10f6/hurricane_season_in_the_midst_of_covid19_part_2/,9,2021-08-26
I (27m) want to but I can't pull back from my gf (23f),"My girlfriend recently gave plenty of red flags that kind of disappointed me. She is my first girlfriend, that I actually became exclusive with and introduced with my parents. We've been together for 10months. So ... what happened was this:  
We did some traveling this summer to a few countries and I always end up paying the blunt of the expenses. But this last one took the cake. I took her to Italy, to my parent's humble country home ( bought with sweat and tears ). I rented a car. I took her to Florence, paid for the hotel and the garage for the car. I took her to San Marino. I took her to the beach. I took her all over the country side, paying for everything, while she just bought things for herself like souvenirs.   


All of this I can stomach. I am no rich but I have a nice job I bust my butt at and can afford it. But all this and I didn't get a single ""thanks"". Or a single sign for appreciation. She just acted like she's entitled to it. She even had an attitude the whole time. And in the end, after I spend nearly 90 hours driving during the vacation, while she slept in the car, I get a ""Italy wasn't really that impressive"".   


This was not at all what she was like before, but this summer she just kept getting worse and worse in a matter of months. And demands we take weekend trips while being unemployed, and I am getting smashed at work.   


My initial instinct is to pull back and not give her a dime more for anything. Stop driving her around the city and in general start not simping ( it sure feels like it ). But I feel like this isn't right since I've always punished girls I only fool around with this way. While this is an actual relationship so I don't know how to act.   
Sure as hell doesn't seem like something that would change with a simple ""please stop, I don't like this"", perhaps this is how she was raised.",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pc61ub/i_27m_want_to_but_i_cant_pull_back_from_my_gf_23f/,,Sim0ray,pc61ub,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pc61ub/i_27m_want_to_but_i_cant_pull_back_from_my_gf_23f/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pc61ub/i_27m_want_to_but_i_cant_pull_back_from_my_gf_23f/,6,2021-08-26
A contractor working on my home rudely asked if I speak English - Should I tell his company or my builder?,"Hi, I‚Äôm not sure what to do, maybe you guys here could offer some advice because I don‚Äôt want other people to deal with such a rude person and I think his boss or even the house builder that pays for this company‚Äôs services.

TLDR: contractor asks me (27F Asian) if I ‚Äúspeak  English‚Äù when he cannot explain why he cant replace more scratched hardwood planks in a brand new home. My parents were immigrants but I was born here and I have a Canadian accent since it‚Äôs the only language I speak fluently. He is an immigrant (he speaks Arabic or Farsi on the phone?) but his English unfortunately is actually really bad. I feel like he was mocking me by asking if I speak English because knowing if I do doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything. Should I email or call his company (or the home builder that hires his company) to report this? Or should I make peace with it knowing the company still has to get someone else (I met him already) to do tile repairs

I‚Äôm in Canada and was born here but am Asian. Flooring installer tries to explain why it‚Äôs not a good idea to replace several planks, sort of gesturing and saying ‚Äútongue and groove‚Ä¶no nails‚Ä¶‚Äù but he doesn‚Äôt say it correctly because, well it wasn‚Äôt a full sentence and maybe I just didn‚Äôt understand because I didn‚Äôt know he wasn‚Äôt going to put the nails back in for the new planks. Also I don‚Äôt think English is his first language because he often omits words and has an accent, no biggie though because I‚Äôm a child of immigrants so I feel for him. So in a friendly way, I smile and tell him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it :)‚Äù to which he responds ‚Äúu speak English?‚Äù Very pointedly no waited for my answer. I tell him ‚Äúso you‚Äôre saying you can‚Äôt replace more than a few scratches planks?‚Äù Him:‚Äùyes yes‚Äù. That wasn‚Äôt what I didn‚Äôt understand but whatever. I wanted him to explain why he can‚Äôt replace more planks that are scratched. How does knowing whether I speak English help anyway when it‚Äôs actually him that doesn‚Äôt speak it well?

He proceeded to be less rude because I started using bigger words and explaining why I think it‚Äôs no right to have a brand new home with so many hardwood scratches. He said he would replace more planks if everything but once i left the room he spoke on the phone loudly to say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs thousand plank here‚Äù. Don‚Äôt forget he was the one to assess the home before and had a whole box delivered here because back then he said the home had many planks to replace. When he was done there we‚Äôre still a lot of planks in the box.

Later on once he‚Äôs done he says maybe there was some miscommunication and I told him I can understand his professional opinion about not replacing more planks (he tried to tell me scratches in a new home should be expected when it‚Äôs literally his job to come do repairs but I understood once I asked my husband over text that replacing can be not optimal) but I didn‚Äôt appreciate him asking me if I speak english. He looked surprised and kind of smiled in a laughing way and put his hands together to say he‚Äôs so sorry feels so bad, said ‚ÄúI so sorry my kids, my father‚Äù. He asked me to sign the documents attesting he did the work and kept saying he feels bad so I told him to leave because hearing him apologize made me so frustrated I became teary-eyed.",Advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pc1svy/a_contractor_working_on_my_home_rudely_asked_if_i/,,Bud-8580,pc1svy,/r/Advice/comments/pc1svy/a_contractor_working_on_my_home_rudely_asked_if_i/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pc1svy/a_contractor_working_on_my_home_rudely_asked_if_i/,6,2021-08-26
"I am sorry, it's the only way"," 

My account keeps being taken down, i guess even reddit is against me.

Funny...I was wondering what to write here, usually I know exactly what to say at all times, but now, i find myself struggling to find the right words, after all, how does one justify his own suicide? How does one justifies the unjustifiable? How do I put the feelings and circumstances that have lead me to this very moment? I don't think i can, yet I'll give it my best shot at expressing just a fraction of my final thoughts before the end.

How do I begin? Do I say I was born in 1994 in a working class family? Or do I skip ahead a few years when my babysitter and local priest molested me at age 8? Or even way later when, a few months ago, my fianc√© left me after I lost my job at the university? ""you never smile"" she said. Hell, I don't know! Suffice to say that I am a failed human being! Failed at everything! Failed as a teacher, failed as a friend, son, sibling... There's nothing left to loose but my life, that in itself holds very little value.

I am an extremely selfish person....have been all my life, why should my end be any different? All my life has been about me! MY PTSD, MY depression, MY bipolar disorder, MY frustrations and disappointments. It's hard to make yourself selfless when every day is a struggle for survival, when you're a husk of a human being and joy is impossible to be achieved. When you are in such a miserable state you're not alive, you just exist, and existing is not enough!

I'm loosing my home... I'm about to become homeless! This is something that's constantly on my mind... How would that first night in the streets feel like?... Sleeping on the curb, no-one paying attention to you, like I am not even there... Will some of them throw nickels at me? Maybe! No... That won't happen to me!

ow did I get here? I did everything right! I studied hard, graduated top of my class, had a good job, ate my veggies... Tried to teach people! Tried to educate them on the good path, an honest path. Now what? Did I leave behind anything worthy of note? I guess not! I was a mediocre teacher, mediocre fianc√©, mediocre son, mediocre human being who had all the chances in the world and wasted them all! Now I'm here, ready to end it all!

Jesus... I don't even recognise myself anymore... It feels like I lost all weight and I am just floating towards the end... I guess this is it... How can I finish such letter? With a message of hope? Of wisdom? I'm not wise! I guess I'll say that:

You need love more than anything, true love! Love heals every wound, love endures! True love is as precious as diamonds! Enjoy your life while you can and be there for each other...

Entitled parents tried to get me arrested,"Let me start by saying a guy and I‚Äôm bi, but I have only ever had one boyfriend, this was when I was 19, he was 16, we never passionately hugged, but we kissed and held hands and hugged in a comforting way, I never had much money at this time, because I couldn‚Äôt work due to mental health issues, I did clam benefits though so I had some money.

Cast: entitled dad (ED) entitled mum (EM) but hole brother (BHB) me and boyfriend (BF)

When I was 19, I met a 16 yo through college, we started dating almost immediately after meeting, after a week of dating I met BF‚Äôs mum and dad, they seemed great at first, when ever I went around, EM would ask me how I was and how I was doing in college, ED would always cut me off though if I tried to explain what I was doing in college, just figured he really didn‚Äôt care (where I‚Äôm from this is a common attitude to something you have no interest in), EM always invited me to go out with them on family days out but, what ever she spent on me, she would ask me to pay back, (I never really thought anything about it as, my parents have raised me to pay my way and never expect anything for free), over the next few weeks I spent all my time at BF‚Äôs house even slept there most nights,(in separate beds) when ever I was there my BF‚Äôs younger brother,BHB, always tried to get involved with us, he had to be in my BF room if we was chilling in there, or playing on the PlayStation, BHB would wind constantly that it wasn‚Äôt fair that me and BF were aloud to be alone, as I said, we never passionately hugged, we just wanted to be alone, but we was never aloud (BHB was 12yo and he constantly wanted to be around his brother and his brothers boyfriend, weird) ED constantly took BHB‚Äôs side. Then‚Ä¶ one day‚Ä¶ ED asked how much money I got from my benefits, (major red flag) me being a stupid 19yo I told him, it was close to ¬£200, ED said ‚Äúseeing as your at my house all the time, it‚Äôs only right that you start paying me rent, because you are over 18 and you spend more time at my house, than you do at your own‚Äù, (now I was actually paying rent to my parents; ¬£100 a month), I asked ED how much he wanted me to pay, ED gave me the nastiest look, I mean if looks could kill I would have dropped dead there and then, ED ‚Äú¬£40 will do‚Äù, I told him it was no problem, after all I was dating his son and I knew they weren‚Äôt the richest of people, I kept paying ED ¬£40 every month on top of the ¬£100 to my own parents, then about 3 weeks before Christmas, after dating BF for little over a year, ED told me that I had to give him all my money so he could buy Christmas presents, I told him I could give him ¬£100 but I had to give my parents ¬£100 for rent, ED preceded to go off it absolutely losing it, I got up and told him I was going to talk to BF, as I went to leave the room ED said ‚Äúeither give me your ¬£200 or I‚Äôll tell the police that you passionately abused BHB‚Äù, I stopped dead in my tracks, turned, looked him dead in the eye and said ‚Äúyou do and I‚Äôll stamp on your efing head‚Äù, I then went to tell BF that I was going home and I‚Äôd speak to him later, I went back to my parents house and immediately told them what happened, they told me not to worry, that night I got a call from BF telling me that we couldn‚Äôt date anymore, I asked why and he simply said his dad wouldn‚Äôt let us, I was heartbroken I couldn‚Äôt believe it, ED broke me and my BF up, just because I wouldn‚Äôt give him ¬£200, I was so devastated, the next day the police knocked on my parents door asking me to go down to the station to talk about some allegations, my heart skipped I knew exactly what was going on, when I got to the station my suspicions were confirmed, ED followed through with his threats, he told the police that I was in a passionate relationship with BHB, I told the police EVERYTHING, the police realised immediately what was going on, with in minutes the investigation was closed, I thought that was it‚Ä¶ nope

ONE WEEK LATER, I was in my local Asda when EM noticed me with my mum, she decided to start screaming in the middle of Asda that I was a molester and that I passionately hugged her under age son, my mum the efing legend she is, walked up to her clam as anyone can possibly be, then punched EM square in the face, EM basically slid across the floor holding her face, me and my mum just walked out, that was the last time I ever saw any of them. 

I found out though, through a mutual friend, they tried the same thing with ex BF when he turned 18 and started working, he walked out and never went back home, he stayed with a friend until he could afford his own place, I never got back In touch with ex BF, honestly even if he had efed his family off, I didn‚Äôt want to be involved with his toxic family and I just knew, they would somehow still be in his life.

The Magic Of Television,"My grandpa Chuck is a Baby Boomer, and without a doubt, the most quintessentially Boomer thing my grandpa does is maintain a ‚Äòdisplay room‚Äô. It‚Äôs basically a second living room, except instead of IKEA, it‚Äôs filled with artisanal, luxury European furnishings, which no one is allowed to lay a finger on. There are China cabinets, filled with multiple sets of fine China, that have never once been used. All manner of collectibles decorate every surface, and the only time they‚Äôve ever been moved since they‚Äôve been in that room is when my grandpa cleans the place. There‚Äôs even an antique piano, even though he couldn‚Äôt play chopsticks if his life depended on it.  

It‚Äôs just a whole room filled with the most expensive things my grandfather could afford, treated as sacred cows of consumerism, none of which he dares to get any practical use out of. It‚Äôs not that weird, not for a Boomer anyway, but what is weird is that he keeps a television in there too. No one‚Äôs supposed to be in that room, and I always thought that putting a television in there would just encourage people to use it. It‚Äôs not a big TV either, and as far as I know, the only thing that really makes TVs expensive is their size. I did ask my grandpa about it once, about why it deserved a place in his display room, and all he would say was that ‚Äòthey don‚Äôt make ‚Äôem like that, anymore‚Äô. 

Late last year, before vaccines were available here, grandpa caught Covid and was in the hospital for a little while, and asked if I could housesit for him. He was slowly dying of coronavirus, and his number one concern was that his stuff was okay. Pure Boomer energy there. Regardless of what I thought of his priorities, I agreed so that he wouldn‚Äôt be worried and could focus on getting better. He wrote down a rather extensive list of rules for what to do and what not to do, some of which were exasperatingly neurotic but not really out of the ordinary. 

That is, until it came to the television in the display room. Here‚Äôs what he wrote for it. 

1. When cleaning the display room, do not touch the television set, except for any of the reasons listed below. 

2. If the cabinet doors are open, close them immediately.

3. When the television is off, do not look at your reflection on the screen. 

4. Don‚Äôt sit too close to the television, on or off. 

5. If the television is on, turn it off immediately, and remember that TV isn‚Äôt real.

6. When it‚Äôs on, be careful not to bring your hand close enough to feel static on the screen. 

7. If it doesn‚Äôt turn off, leave the house immediately, and call me. Don‚Äôt try to unplug it. 

8. **Never** change the channel. 

9.  If you fail to follow these rules and there‚Äôs an incident with the television, **do not** destroy it. **He** doesn‚Äôt make them like that anymore.  

I honestly wasn't all that concerned by this. My grandpa knew I was curious about his mysterious old television set, and I figured he was just messing with me. I had been in his house lots of times before, and I had no reason to believe that the television was dangerous or supernatural in any way. 

I settled into my grandpa‚Äôs house, and went straight to work attending to his lengthy list of instructions. It was mostly yard work, even though there was no garden; just a large crop of homogenous grass under the vigilant gaze of ceramic gnomes and plastic flamingos, all of which he was inordinately proud of. Any weed or wildflower that dared to rear its nonconforming head was living on borrowed time, and if any of his neighbour‚Äôs creeping ivy got onto his side of the fence on my watch, there‚Äôd be hell to pay. 

Being busy and outdoors most of the day, it wasn‚Äôt until I was eating my dinner that evening that I noticed it; the sound of electric static. I didn‚Äôt notice it all at once. It was more of a gradual awareness that I was hearing a very faint white noise that I couldn‚Äôt account for. I silenced every appliance or electronics that I could to listen for it, and I realized that it was television static. 

I followed the sound into the hallway, and in the gap between the display room‚Äôs door and the floor, I could see the flickering light of a television set. 

I was momentarily unsettled by this revelation, since it was an old clunker of a television that shouldn‚Äôt have been able to turn itself on. I quickly dismissed the thought as irrational though. My grandpa must have left it on before he went into the hospital, either by accident or on purpose just to mess with me, and both the sound and the light had been too faint for me to notice before. 

Remembering his list of rules regarding that television, and fully aware there might be some kind of a prank waiting for me inside, I cautiously opened the door and stepped into the cherished room of expensive and useless junk. 

It was as immaculate as I remembered it, seemingly not a single item having been moved since the last time I was there. The entire room was bathed in nothing but the monochromatic flickering from the staticky television, which made everything seem about ten times creepier than it did in the light of day.

The only lamp in the room wasn‚Äôt plugged into the correct socket for the light switch to work, so I didn‚Äôt bother trying to turn it on. I figured I would turn off the TV, and then use the light on my phone to see my way out. Since I saw no evidence of any booby traps that my grandpa might have laid for me, I headed towards the television, diligently watching my step as I did so. 

The cabinet doors were wide open, which was weird in and of itself, as my grandfather always kept them shut. I was supposed to shut them too, after turning the TV off, but I couldn‚Äôt help but take a moment to examine it while I had the chance. 

It looked like a classic 1950‚Äôs television set, with a wooden box frame, bulging glass screen, and knobs for control. But right below the screen, in shiny brass letters, were the words ‚ÄòIn Glorious Retrovision‚Ñ¢‚Äô. This was confusing to me, since that implied it was a recreation. I saw that there was a framed letter hanging on the inside of the cabinet door, and while it was hard to read in the dim and inconsistent light, I was able to make out that it was a Letter of Certification. 

It stated that the television in question was a genuine In Glorious Retrovision‚Ñ¢, made by an individual called Volodya Dragovic, followed by some nonsense about it using special crystals for transceiving waves in the Panpsychic Aether. 

So that's what made it special then? It was a joke? Some sort of uncharacteristic meta-commentary on the room itself by my grandfather? I shook my head in confusion, and reached down to turn the television off. 

I jolted my hand back when I saw a face in the static staring back at me. 

‚ÄúHey there, ducky!‚Äù the face grinned. It looked like a young woman‚Äôs face, her dark hair worn in girlish bunches, her smile equal parts sweet and sinister. 

I shrieked at the sight of her, stepping backwards and slamming the cabinet doors shut as I did so. I was left in almost complete darkness at that point, the only light being whatever flickering static managed to seep through the cracks in the cabinet door.

‚ÄúNow that wasn‚Äôt very nice,‚Äù the girl chastised me, pouting a little as she did so. ‚ÄúI just wanted to say hi. Is this your first time using an In Glorious Retrovision‚Ñ¢? I‚Äôve never seen you on here before.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou, you can see me through the television?‚Äù I stammered. I hadn‚Äôt noticed any sort of camera built-in or connected to the television set. 

‚ÄúOf course, ducky. It‚Äôs like a telescreen from Nineteen Eight-Four,‚Äù the girl replied. ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Mary, by the way. Mary Darling. What‚Äôs yours?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ Chris,‚Äù I answered, hoping that that would be sufficient. 

‚ÄúHello Chris, a pleasure to meet you,"" she said sweetly. ""Would you mind opening the cabinet doors so that I can see you? My brother's out, and I‚Äôm *sooo* bored. I just want to talk to somebody.‚Äù

I froze, unsure of what I should do. My grandfather‚Äôs list made it very clear that I should shut the television off immediately. But this girl, if that‚Äôs even what she was, had taken notice of me, and I was getting an extremely strong vibe that she was not someone I wanted to offend. 

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ yeah, sure. No problem. Sorry I slammed them shut on you like that. You startled me, is all,‚Äù I said unconvincingly as I slowly pulled open the cabinet doors to reveal her smirking, staticky face. 

‚ÄúYeah, I tend to startle people a lot,‚Äù she said, playfully twirling her right pigtail. ‚ÄúThis is Chuck‚Äôs Retrovision‚Ñ¢, right? How do you know him?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAh, he‚Äôs my grandpa, actually,‚Äù I blurted, immediately regretting it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre friends with him, I take it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, not exactly. He usually tunes out the instant he sees I‚Äôve tuned in,‚Äù she admitted. ‚ÄúBut I manage to catch him off guard every now and then, though.‚Äù 

 I swallowed nervously, wondering what it was about this strange girl that had made my grandfather so diligently avoid her. I glanced down at the television set, looking for the power button. 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that, ducky,‚Äù she said, except this time her voice came from behind me and was free of any static distortion. I spun around and saw her sitting on the couch, lit by the glow from the accursed television. Her hair was pitch black, her eyes baby blue, and her silk bathrobe, lipstick, and nail polish were all bright red. She held a cherry-garnished martini in one hand, a cigarette in the other, and tucked into the sash of her robe were several gleaming kitchen knives which became orders of magnitude more frightening just through association with her. 

I couldn‚Äôt process how she had gotten there. It seemed impossible, but since she wasn‚Äôt acting hostile at the moment, I was more dumbfounded than terrified, though I was still plenty terrified. 

‚ÄúHow, how did you, how did you get here?‚Äù I stammered.

‚ÄúMmmm. I‚Äôm not. This is just a projection. You‚Äôre perfectly safe, ducky,‚Äù she said as she took a sip of her martini. ‚ÄúNo, I never leave my playroom without my brother James. A woman‚Äôs place is in the home, especially when that home is an extradimensional pocket of spacetime that she can bend to her every whim. James goes out on his own when we need new playthings or other supplies, and he enjoys the challenges working within this reality poses. Me though, I prefer being perpetually drunk on the sense of god-like, nigh-omnipotence I get from ruling our playroom. I get bored when he‚Äôs out though, like I said, so I play around with the Retrovision‚Ñ¢, see who‚Äôs watching. Come, sit beside me, and I‚Äôll show you how this thing works!‚Äù 

I couldn‚Äôt smell her cigarette at all, which seemed to corroborate her claim that she wasn‚Äôt really there. That meant that I was safe for the moment, it seemed. It also meant that I could run away, but that seemed likely to upset her and might end up biting me in the ass down the line. Humouring her seemed like the least risky thing to do, so I politely sat beside her. 

‚ÄúAh, you said that you just being a projection meant I was safe. Why wouldn‚Äôt I be safe if you were really here?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look that dangerous.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs kind of the point. If I was a grotesque monster instead of a pretty girl, you‚Äôd probably had done the smart thing and ran out of here as fast as you could,‚Äù she grinned at me. ‚ÄúBut, since you asked, I‚Äôm actually a cannibalistic serial killer, as clich√© as that sounds.‚Äù 

I chuckled as affably as I could, only for her to take a drag from her cigarette as she glared at me in disdain.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not joking,‚Äù she said coldly. ‚ÄúBetween us, my brother and I kill at least dozens of people every year, and I haven't gone a day without eating human flesh since I was a kid. I‚Äôve always got bits of someone else in my intestines, since I use it in all my cooking. When I was young, I even served it to my parents. I told them I got the meat from Home Economics class, and when I killed my parents, I served some of them to my Home Economics class and told them I got the meat from home! And it‚Äôs not just fun; it‚Äôs healthy too! A human body has everything the human body needs. You just have to avoid the brain because of the prions. And my cannibalism is purely culinary, by the way. I have no respect for survival cannibalism. I don‚Äôt abandon *my* principles when things get rough. I‚Äôm sorry, I can see you‚Äôre sick of me shoving my lifestyle down your throat. It‚Äôs a shame I‚Äôm not really here, because then I could literally shove my cooking down your throat! Oh well. Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs on TV.‚Äù

She set down her martini and pulled out an old-fashioned remote from her robe.

‚ÄúAh, my grandpa said not to change the channel,‚Äù I protested weakly, knowing it would be useless. 

‚ÄúOh, he left you some rules for this, did he?‚Äù she asked as she threw her head back in laughter. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm not big on rules.‚Äù 

With a click of a button, the static-filled screen changed into a monochromatic scene of what looked like an occult office or study. There were gothic bookshelves, a big and ornate desk with a leather chair, and a multitude of antique chests stacked around the room. 

‚ÄúBe very quiet,‚Äù she whispered to me with a mischievous smile. ‚ÄúSince I‚Äôm using your Retrovision‚Ñ¢, he won‚Äôt know it‚Äôs me right away.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe hell I won‚Äôt, Darling! You think I can‚Äôt recognize that eldritch aura of yours on a different frequency?‚Äù a cantankerous old man shouted from somewhere off-screen. ‚ÄúStay off my psi waves, or so help me, I will personally see to it that you end up crammed into the same floating box as your Uncle Larry!‚Äù  

A dark form briefly moved in front of the screen before it went back to static. 

‚ÄúHmm. Alright, I guess that‚Äôs not going to work,‚Äù she said, disappointed but not upset. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay though. There are things besides other Retrovisions‚Ñ¢ putting out strong enough signals that this can pick up.‚Äù

She started flipping through the channels rapidly, most of them containing nothing but more static. A few of them contained semi-coherent images and half-audible sounds, but she never stayed on those long enough for me to get a good grasp of what they actually were. It wasn't until she found her first clear image that something seemed to grab her attention. 

There on the screen was a hooded, hunchback figure perched atop some stone ruins like a gargoyle, leaning on a strange shepherd‚Äôs crook. Its head looked vaguely like the skull of an elephant or a mammoth, with a singular, cyclopean orifice in the front. The orifice held a small glowing light deep with its abyssal darkness, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was supposed to be a mouth, an airway, a sensory organ, or all three. 

Beneath the orifice was a pair of long, tentacle-like appendages that fell to nearly the creature‚Äôs waist. Pairs of spiracles and wispy tendrils ran all along their tapering length until they each ended in a sharp, hooked talon. The creature‚Äôs fingers, clawed and twice as long as they would be on a human, numbered exactly seven; four on the right hand and three on the left, the slender extra digit appearing to be a specialized and possibly vestigial appendage. Its feet were digitigrade, almost velociraptor-like, and it seemed like there was at least one more tentacle, or possibly a tail, hiding under its robes. But other than that, it was humanoid. 

Despite that, something about it was deeply unsettling. Deeply aberrant. Deeply wrong. 

‚ÄúFinally; something good!‚Äù Mary squeed in delight. 

‚ÄúIs that thing real?‚Äù I asked her, still unsure of how the RetrovisionTM was supposed to work. 

‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs not from this reality, so arguably no,‚Äù she smiled. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a wanderer, a planeswalker; he‚Äôs from another level of existence altogether. I can tell from his aura.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean it‚Äôs an alien?‚Äù I asked skeptically.

‚ÄúAn extra-dimensional alien, yes, but I‚Äôve never seen his kind before,‚Äù she nodded. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt believe me, do you?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, I mean, what makes you think it‚Äôs not just a guy in a suit, or an animatronic, or CGI?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt exactly look out of place on the set of a sci-fi movie.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI told you, I can tell from his aura that he‚Äôs not from this plane,‚Äù she insisted. ‚ÄúBut, if for some reason the word of a cannibalistic serial killer isn‚Äôt good enough for you, why don‚Äôt you go in for a closer look? These screens having surprisingly good resolution.‚Äù 

Her tone made it clear that her suggestion was actually an order, so I obediently got up and cautiously approached the television. Up close, I could see that the creature wore a leather vambrace on its left arm, with three glowing, hemispherical dials on it, along with various other clockwork accoutrements. A belt around its waist bore a similar design, and its robes had been spun from a strange sort of silk with angular fractals embroidered into them. 

Such fine, if odd, garments upon so monstrous a creature were part of what made it so unsettling. Its inhuman ‚Äì no, *unearthly* ‚Äì anatomy marked it as something utterly alien, but it had clad itself in what I could recognize as the trappings of both civilization and erudition. 

It stood oddly still, silently peering out into the night around it, like an ambush predator waiting in silence for prey to walk by. I couldn‚Äôt see much other than the creature itself, but from what I could tell, it was alone and no one else had noticed it yet. I studied its skin closely, trying to discern if it was a silicone or digital illusion, but as far as I could tell, it looked like living cephalopod skin to me. I peered in closer and closer, bringing my face so close to the screen that I could feel its strong static field on my nose. 

That‚Äôs when the creature jolted its head towards me, the glowing dot in its orifice darting around like the lure of an angler fish. 

I pulled back from the screen so quickly that I toppled backwards, landing halfway on the couch, where Mary was laughing hysterically. 

‚ÄúOh my god. Did it see me? Did it see me?‚Äù I screamed. Before she could answer, there was a tapping at the window. We both turned to see the creature standing outside, drumming at the glass with one of its clawed tentacles. 

I bolted for the door, but when I threw it open the creature had translocated again and was blocking my path, this time with both its mouth tentacles arched upwards like two cobras poised to strike. Even with its hunched posture, it was just barely shorter than the doorframe, and I had no chance of muscling past it. My only way to escape was breaking through the window, but what good would that do against a being that could teleport? I didn't dare to fight it either, so instead, I just fell flat on my ass and begged for my life.

""I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I wasn't looking for you! I don't even know what you are! I wouldn't know how to find you again if I had to! She was the one who did it! If you're worried about being found again, take her, please! I'm no threat to you!"" 

‚ÄúI love it when they beg,‚Äù Mary chortled as she ate the cherry from her martini. ‚ÄúAlmost as much as I love a good snuff film. Strangle him with those snake arms of yours and gut him like a fish!‚Äù 

At that moment, I had no reason to believe that the creature could understand either of us. It looked down at me, then up at Mary, and then over to the old television set. It tapped a claw to the device on its wrist, and the channel changed to show Mary sitting in her living room, her gleefully sadistic expression instantly turning to one of dismay. 

‚ÄúAh‚Ä¶ oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!‚Äù she cursed as she fumbled with the remote. The projection of her vanished immediately, but she seemed to be having some trouble turning her own Retrovision off. The strange creature looked down at me one last time, its orifice and tentacles somehow forming an expression that I read as a kindly smile.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs outrageous what they allow on TV these days,‚Äù it remarked in an echoey, dead-pan voice, which may have just been in my head. 

The creature teleported again, this time reappearing on the television with Mary. She shouted and pulled out her knives, but the creature dodged her blows and grabbed her arms in its tentacles. The walls of the room they were in began to melt, and then‚Ä¶ I turned off the TV. It was pitch black in the room, but in the screen‚Äôs dull afterglow, I could just make out my reflection. Deciding I should follow at least one of my grandpa‚Äôs rules, I slammed the cabinet doors shut before the image could register in my brain and I got the hell out of there. 

I don‚Äôt know what happened between Mary and that creature, and so long as I never see either of them again, I don‚Äôt care. I called my grandfather, told him what happened and that I couldn‚Äôt stay in that house anymore. Fortunately, he was understanding, but not exactly forthcoming on anything he knew about what I had been through. 

When he got out of the hospital, the first thing he did was check on his display room. Nothing was broken or missing or even out of place, with one exception; a kitchen knife was embedded into the couch, exactly where I had been sitting. It looked like it had been thrown straight from the television; or, as impossible as it sounds, through it. 

Mary had tried to kill me at some point, it seems, even from the other side of the screen. She had missed her shot and I, mesmerized by what I saw on the TV screen, failed to notice.   

Small wonder then that my grandfather always keeps the TV cabinet [doors](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/) [closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/).",JustNotRight,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNotRight/comments/pc8nl2/the_magic_of_television/,Horror,A_Vespertine,pc8nl2,/r/JustNotRight/comments/pc8nl2/the_magic_of_television/,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNotRight/comments/pc8nl2/the_magic_of_television/,2,2021-08-26

AITA My girlfriend got a rash on her face and neck.,"So she says she got her rash from the detergent she used for her clothes and so she showed me and i said woe and didn't think anything of it and she got mad at me for not caring and so i got dressed and went for a walk and on my way back to our place, she was leaving and she said i don't care and leaves, later i am watching this show and one of the characters wake up with bites or bug bites on her arm and the boyfriend says oh its this and says to go back to bed and the character who got bit got mad and said ""Why don't you just support me"" and that got me pondering if i was wrong.
My girlfriend always gets those bad rashes from drinking citrus drinks like orange juice and thats why i wasn't.... Well i don't know, however maybe i should support her no matter how much one thing happens because she isnt bothered by the rashes she already gets.
I thought since her new reason for getting a rash wasn't that big of a deal however it was for her.

EDIT: Thankfully she is home so i don't have to worry about her walking around at night, however she is ghosting me all night and being distant, i have given her hugs and kisses and she hasn't gave me any back.",AmItheAsshole,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbzj8c/aita_my_girlfriend_got_a_rash_on_her_face_and_neck/,,arrriah,pbzj8c,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbzj8c/aita_my_girlfriend_got_a_rash_on_her_face_and_neck/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pbzj8c/aita_my_girlfriend_got_a_rash_on_her_face_and_neck/,3,2021-08-26
Is it normal for my 7 month old to have trouble focusing on me?,"Hi there, first post of what I'm sure will be many.

My new Aussie baby is just over seven months. She's my first puppy (had dogs all my life, but not any babies since I was like, eight) and I have adored working with her. It has been so fulfilling going to classes with her, and last week she graduated her basic manners/groundwork class, and is now in a class focusing on preparing her for the CGC and ACGC tests.

She has all of her tricks down at home. Sit, down, lay on side, shake, nose touch, and stay. However, her walking behaviors are struggling because for the life of me, I can't get her to focus on me. 

We take one 20-minute walk every morning on a street with mild distractions (would like to do more, but it is way too hot for her feet later in the day). Cars go by, and we'll see one or two runners on average, but sometimes there will be groups out. She learned all of her good walking behaviors in groundwork class, and she has improved, but I seem to be at a standstill. Eventually I get boring, and she decides she'd rather stop and sniff instead, or start pulling every five steps, and god forbid someone walk by or even be walking on the other side of the street. I use Hormel pepperoni minis, and she could not care one bit about me once something else gets her attention. And I don't know how to work redirect if she refuses to look at me, even if I have the treat right in front of her face. This had lead to her ""leave it""s really falling behind, and there's no way she'll be ready for the tests by the end of this class. 

But, I also recognize she's just a baby still. Is this normal for her age? Will she grow into a more attentive pooch, and be willing to look at me, or should I be doing something to work this better?

AITA For kicking my(25M) (Possibly now Ex) GF(23F) out after not following my house rules?,"My GF was kicked out of her apartment 2 weeks ago, since she does not have a good relationship with her parents and doesn't have any friends with anything beyond a 1 bedroom college dorm she asked me if she could stay with me until she finds something else.

I agreed because she had nowhere else to go, but I have to be clear this was in no way an arrangement of us living together, this is my first place on my own and I have no interest in moving in with anyone in the forseeable future.

I don't have a lot of rules save for 3, clean up your messes, don't wear your shoes inside and stay out of the room at the end of the hallway. I am into fixing, building and tinkering with computers and computer parts on my off time and the room at the end of the hall has everything in it amounting to a lot of money and I do not want anyone touching it or risk breaking any of it and before you ask, no the room does not have a lock as I live alone so no reason.

No doubt you see where this is going. She invited a couple of friends over, they got pretty drunk, they ended up entering the room and tripped over and stood on multiple components amounting to at a minimum several hundreds worth of damage. I came home to one of her friends passed out in the room, another passed out on the couch and her and a friend in my bed, the place was a complete mess.

I didn't wait a moment and kicked her friends out, made her clean up the place while semi drunk and started checking what they had broken in the room.

I told her I wanted her to leave the next day, she started apologising and told me she'd pay me back to which she quickly backtracked when I told her a rough estimate(She's a college student so 1000 or so is roughly her entire part time work income in 2 and a half months) this led to crying, which led to begging, so I told her if she cant even follow the most basic of rules, I dont trust her in my place period.

She has since not yet found a new place or somewhere to stay, she slept in her car once and has been couchsurfing and sparing no detail telling me about it. I feel kinda bad so am I TA?",AmItheAsshole,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pc28qw/aita_for_kicking_my25m_possibly_now_ex_gf23f_out/,,Astrazerica,pc28qw,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pc28qw/aita_for_kicking_my25m_possibly_now_ex_gf23f_out/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pc28qw/aita_for_kicking_my25m_possibly_now_ex_gf23f_out/,587,2021-08-26
Belle Guide,"Belle is one of the few true snipers and one of the best brawlers and mids in the game. In this guide, I will go over her abilities and how to use them for the best success with her.

**Main Attack - Shocker**

*Damage - 1540*

*Range - 10*

*Reload speed - 1.4*

*Projectile speed - 4000*

Belle's main attack is arguably the best of all snipers in the game. The reason for this is her very fast reload speed and projectile speed compared to those of Brock and Piper. It is much harder to hit attacks with these brawlers (aside from their gadgets) and missing shots is also much more punishing as you will have to wait longer to fire more. Belle's attack can be autoaimed even from max range at times as long as the enemy is not moving in one direction horizontally, in which case they would be easier to hit manually. At midrange, auto aiming nearly always hits normal speed brawlers. If you do happen to miss, it's nothing to worry about unlike Brock and Piper. The icing on the cake for this main attack is the bouncing mechanic. Hitting an enemy with Shocker will give them an electricity effect which lasts a short duration and will bounce to another enemy within three tiles for half the damage and super charge up to three times. This provides control at choke points or when enemies clump up. The bounce shot will home in on enemies even if they exit the range, so the only way to avoid it once it occurs is by a dashing or jumping ability. 

**Super - Spotter**

*Damage - 700*

*Range - 10.67*

*Projectile speed - 4000*

Belle's super ability fires a shot that leaves a mark on any hit enemy which makes them take 35% more damage from all sources until they die, a different enemy is marked, or a goal is scored in Brawl Ball. This does not leave a mark on the safe or IKE, but will work on spawnables and the Siege bot. This makes defense incredibly easy in Siege. In other modes, use Spotter on the enemy's key player. This is the gem carrier in Gem Grab or the mid in Brawl Ball. In Bounty, use it against your lane/mid or the other team's best player. Occasionally, you want to use the super on a tank or to finish off an enemy with the damage in a pinch.

**Gadget**

*Nest Egg*

Belle only has one gadget. Nest Egg places a trap directly where Belle is standing. The trap deals 500 damage and slows for 3 seconds when an enemy steps on it. This gadget is best used on choke points so the enemy can't avoid it, or on the game's objective area, by the gem mine in Gem Grab or the zone in one zone Hot Zone maps. When you place the trap by the mine or on the zone, the enemy is forced to step on it. The slow is really useful and helps you easily confirm the kill. Or, if you get the countdown, when you fall back, the trap will hinder the enemy or allow your teammates to finish them off for an easy victory.

**Star Powers**

*Positive Feedback*

While an enemy is shocked, Belle gains a 20% shield. This lasts for a few more moments after the enemy is no longer shocked. The duration will be extended by bouncing shots. Even after the nerf, this star power still provides a lot of value as you'll be attacking a lot with the quick reload. At full health, this effectively increases Belle's health from 3640 to 4550, which changes many interactions and allows you to play more aggressively.

*Grounded*

When an enemy is hit by Belle's super, they cannot reload for 3 seconds. This star power does not provide much value, as 3 seconds is really not much for the time it takes to charge Belle's super, and the other star power helps you consistently through the whole match. This star power would be better if it permanently slowed the enemy's reload by a small amount, or stopped them from attacking for a few seconds maybe. I recommend using Positive Feedback over Grounded every time.

**Belle's counters**

If you're playing Belle, these brawlers are something to watch out for: Sprout, Buzz, Mortis, Piper, Brock. Sprout easily counters Belle due to being able to attack from behind walls and 3 shot her. Sprout also has a high survivability due to Garden Mulcher and Photosynthesis, and can take a lot of shots. A Buzz with his super or even just the gadget can easily beat a Belle, as she has nothing to stop or escape the buoy, and Buzz just has too much health for Belle. Note that you'll usually only face a Buzz in Brawl Ball or Siege unless he's with PDT. Mortis is the same, other than the last sentence. Piper and Brock (especially after his buff) are good counters because once they hit their first shot, they can gadget and autoaim for an easy kill. 

**Synergies**

Belle works best with Crow on long ranged maps just as any other sharpshooter does. His Slowing Toxin is mostly unavoidable and lasts a really long time, making it easy for Belle to quickly autoaim shots on any slowed brawler. In maps with more closed areas or wall pockets, Colt and Brock can open up the map to allow Belle to play as she would on any long ranged map.

**Best maps and gadget placements**

Belle's best maps are ones with open mids and/or lanes, preferably with chokepoints for her gadget. I will show locations with blue circles for optimal placements, and purple circles for situational/high risk placements. I don't recommend going to the purple areas unless you get two enemies down or a full teamwipe.

*Hard Rock Mine*

[The gem mine is always an optimal location for the traps. The purples are situational\/high risk because it's very dangerous to go into the enemy's bushes unless one or two of them are dead.](https://preview.redd.it/potfkpfrfpj71.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4c5e275b02e4dc82e4e0ecdde33eb4a1046b465)

*Gem Fort*

[Use the blue circles first, if possible. If you have the countdown and still have gadgets left, use the purple circle if someone's chasing you from the middle. Warning: Sprout may be played here, you may want to counter it.](https://preview.redd.it/32m0xrvlhpj71.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11f288b88f9d029b54a52650296ebb7ff72d2452)

*Undermine*

[If you defeat the enemy mid, you can trap the purple. Just make sure your lanes are keeping their matchup occupied so you don't get ambushed from the sides.](https://preview.redd.it/za5gcmayipj71.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a15217e406032d4a9c381eb6b58a1778e7065f61)

*Flooded Mine*

[Note that you should play passively as a mid on this map and not go very aggressive, as it can be very easy to die and hard to come back from.](https://preview.redd.it/pife02sekpj71.png?width=960&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=75d5225cb0ba79890ebf7ddbeb073dea013fc622)

Sam [M/F],"Growing up, I‚Äôd always been the short, nerdy skinny kid so going away to University always held the hope of shedding that tag.  
There were a few dalliances in my first year - one memorably on the first night where a pretty, curvy blonde girl dragged me off the dancefloor and into the corner of the bar and then home - but on the whole, underwhelming.  
This all started changing in the second year, when I‚Äôd grown up a little, got more confidence and started to take a little more care over my appearance with regular gym workouts and less drinking.    
I‚Äôd seen Sam (in the Uni bar I late September I think, talking to one of my friends) - she was about five foot four, and even in the relative darkness of the uni bar I could see that she was pretty, with wavy black hair down to her shoulders, an upturned nose and soft features.    
She wore a tight black top and jeans, which clung to her figure - a narrow waist, curved bottom and large, firm-looking breasts - about an E cup, I thought.  As she finished talking to my friend, she blew me a kiss.  I reciprocated, but was too shy or stupid to go any further.  Going home, I thought no more of it other than it was pretty cool that a hot girl would do that, but a little bit kicking myself that I hand‚Äôt even thought to say hi and ask her name.  
A few weeks later, a few friends and I were in our classmate Jame‚Äôs room playing cards and smoking weed.  James casually mentioned that ‚Äòbig tits Sam‚Äô would come over, which as a breastophile intrigued me.  A couple of minutes the door creaked open and she - the girl from the bar, who I then knew was Sam - walked through.  
The better-lit dorm rooms gave me a better chance to surreptitiously admire her - she was prettier than I had first thought, but this time wore a baggy hooded jumper hiding her top half.  A skirt cut just about the knee gave an enticing view of her thighs.  I always used to get horny when stoned, and after a couple of seconds one of my friends poked me in the ribs to stop staring.  
We got introduced to one another, and I happily sat there in a zoned-out state whilst she flirted with James.  I assumed that she and him had a thing, so relaxed and joined in the general chat.    
After a few minutes she must have warmed up a little, so took her hoody off.  Pulling it up over her head caused her arms to raise straight upwards, and as the hoody came off we could all see her deep cleavage under a cropped, baggy vest top.  Her heavy bust squished together as she pulled the hoody over her head, giving us all a lust-inducing sight of that full-looking bust peeping out from her bra.  
Queue another poke in the ribs to stop staring.  
After about another hour of general chit-chat, we all got to talking about tv shows and I mentioned that I loved (still do) the Fast Show.  She said she also really enjoyed it - at which point, I mention that there was an episode about an hour later that evening and I planned to head upstairs to my room to watch it.  The next turn of events stunned me a little.  
She responded by asking whether she could join me and I instinctively said yes, and asked whether we‚Äôd all like to go to the bar for a drink first - the fug of weed in the room was getting on my nerves a little, so a change of scene could be welcome.  Nobody else was interested, so just Sam and I got up - she didn‚Äôt pick her hoody up - and headed out.  On the way out, my heart skipped when I saw her look back at the room and raise her eyebrows twice quickly at the room and wink.   Maybe, just maybe, I thought to myself, her and James don‚Äôt have a thing‚Ä¶  
We talked a little whilst walking to the bar - she told me that she was a fourth-year student, 23, and had spent the last year in Japan.    
‚ÄúOh cool - how was it?‚Äù  I ask, making eye contact but also mindful of the fact that in looking down at her, I could see that cleavage smiling back up at me.  
‚ÄúNot too bad- the culture‚Äôs pretty out-there, and being a white woman I was pretty much the centre of male attention, if you know what I mean‚Äù, she said, pushing her breasts upwards a little with her hands.  
By this point, I really didn‚Äôt know what to think - my inexperience meant that I didn‚Äôt know how to flirt or read signs.  In hindsight, my god I must have seemed dumb.  
My only thoughts were on breaking my duck - my flings in the first year had mostly resulted in young women not wanting to go all the way in or, in one case (funnily enough, a Japanese girl who called herself Mary as she didn‚Äôt trust anyone Anglo-Saxon to get her actual name right) would only let me rub myself off against her after five hand jobs and blowjobs hadn‚Äôt sated me.  
As we arrive at the bar she walked through to pick out a quiet table in the corner, and replied with just ‚Äúa small glass of white‚Äù when I asked her what she wanted to drink.  
Over our drinks, she leant forward on the table with her arms squeezed together.  This pushed her breasts together, creating a cleavage at least eight inches deep.  I realised that my earlier estimate of E cups was likely wrong - especially when seeing that her boobs were being pushed up partly by her arms, but mainly by the table.  
After what seemed like a few minutes of tease torture, she pointed at the clock  
‚ÄúWe need to head back to watch the show - I‚Äôll go to the ladies, meet you out front?‚Äù  
‚ÄúSure‚Äù  
As she walked in front of me, another mate in the bar mouthed the words ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in there‚Äù whilst pointing at her and looking at me.    
Fingers crossed, I thought, and nodded back to him with a smirk.  
I head to the front of the bar, and wait with my back to the door on the garden area.  
Suddenly, a couple of footsteps bounded up behind me followed by the sensation of what I can only describe as a basketball being thrown at my left-side ribs.  
‚ÄúOh hi Sam‚Äù I say, as she pushed her enormous right boob into my side.  
‚ÄúBack to yours‚Äù, she replies, slapping my arse and squeezing. ‚ÄúSorry hun, I get a bit cheeky when stoned and drunk‚Äù.  
To recap for a second - I‚Äôm 19, with a breast fetish (more of the origins of that in another story) and horny as .  I genuinely didn‚Äôt know what to say in reply, other than ‚ÄúI think we all do, Sam‚Äù.  
We walk in almost silence the fifty metres to my block, and climb the stairs.  She goes first, and I swear to this day there was an extra wiggle as she did so.    
‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your room?‚Äù  
‚ÄúFar end, on the left.  Door‚Äôs open‚Äù.  
At this point, my brain is screaming sex - but she walked into the room, grabbed the tv remote, turned on the set to the show and threw herself onto the bed.  The jumping and bouncing pushed her breasts further out of her top, which she accentuated by folding her arms under what I know thought to be G cups.  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt just fucking stand there, lie here and let‚Äôs watch this together‚Äù. I lay down, but with my head slightly further down the bed so that she could see the telly - which was to our side, on a table - over me.  
One of the recurring extra actors was Donna Ewin, a British glamour model of the time with wavy black hair and DD cup breasts.  Her role in the show was basically to appear semi-naked in mock sex-comedy scenes.  
‚ÄúWow‚Äù says Sam, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs hot‚Äù.  I‚Äôm now going to try to describe, in real time, what I thought, said and what happened next.  
Right, I think to myself.  She‚Äôs invited herself back to your room, talked about being sexually unsatisfied, gone out of her way to show you a lot of cleavage and used her bust as a battering ram to get your attention.  Fucking well turn around, face her and say &lt;&lt;something&gt;&gt;.  
‚ÄúHah‚Äù, I say, still facing the telly and with my back to her.  Oh, so fucking smooth.  I turn around, to face her, and don‚Äôt factor in our relative head/torso positions.  The result is that I nudge my head into her cleavage, and the next thing I say (‚Äúyes, she is - she looks a little like you too‚Äù - still so smooth) is slightly muffled at the start before I can pull my head back to say the last couple of words.  
She collapses into giggles, still lying on her side facing me, clasping her arms up over her boobs and putting her hands over her face.  The resultant view is of two massive breasts, squished tighter, right in front of my eyes.  Fucking hell I can‚Äôt take this anymore.  As she giggles, she moves her legs against mine and rubs against my erection.  
‚ÄúOoh, are you excited?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI mean - it‚Äôs hard not to be.  And sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúYep, it‚Äôs hard babe‚Äù, she cuts me off.  Her right hand moves downwards onto my crotch.    
‚ÄúFucking hell Joe, you kept that hidden‚Äù. She starts rubbing.  ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs a lucky boy‚Äù.  
She unzips my fly and pulls out my dick.  Grabbing it in both hands, she starts slowly twisting her hands, one on top of the other, around the shaft and rubs up and down.  ‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs about to get luckier if he wants?‚Äù  
I can‚Äôt speak.  I can‚Äôt say anything at all, so I nod and go ‚Äòummghh‚Äô, the universally-recognised expression for horny teenage men that will in later years be replaced by something more erudite.  
Reading my mind, she climbs to straddle me giving me a full view from below.  Her waist, even through her baggy top, is even smaller than I‚Äôd thought.  Her breasts aren‚Äôt.  They‚Äôre massive, almost blocking the view of her pretty face and slim shoulders.  
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre huge, aren‚Äôt they?.  I saw you looking at me in the bar a few weeks ago, I had a sports bra on so to hide the full size‚Äù.  
This is my fantasy coming through - I‚Äôve never got to ask a girl this, but always wanted to.  
‚ÄúHow big are they?‚Äù I smile.  She grabs my hands and squishes them into her breasts through her vest top, using her hands to squeeze my hands in turn to squeeze her boobs.  
‚ÄúFucking massive.  It depends on brand, but basically 34HH is what I use most, some brands that‚Äôs a 30JJ‚Äù, she replies, still using her hands to move mine around her bust.    
‚ÄúOh my god - and they‚Äôre so firm‚Äù I reply.  They really are - firm to squeeze, but also soft enough to be pleasurable to play with.  
‚ÄúEnough about my tits, you could see they were big from the start.  How many inches is that thing, you‚Äôve kept it secret well!‚Äù She points at my erection, pinned under her but still reaching over my belly-button.  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know - never measured it‚Äù I laugh - ‚Äúpants don‚Äôt get sized to that detail, so I‚Ä¶‚Äù   
‚ÄúFucking shut up you nerd‚Äù, she laughs. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need your life story.  Are you ready for this?‚Äù  
She whips off her top and undoes her and bra, and thrusts her breasts over my face.  I can‚Äôt breathe, or can but only just about.  
‚ÄúSuck them.  I love it rough, but nothing rough on the nipples.  Be gentle with those‚Äù.  I gently lick her nipples whilst clamping both hands round her left breast and squeezing.  She starts to moan, and by this point my cock is burning and purple.  
‚ÄúFucking hell, that‚Äôs hot‚Äù she whispers.   No laughing now, we‚Äôre both fully turned-on and ready.  She grabs my right hand from her breast and places my index finger and middle finger through her knickers and between her thighs onto her wet opening.  Without saying a word, she starts to rub and push my hand into her, herself onto my hand.  Her moaning deepens, and for what I think is about two or three minutes she grinds my hand and smothers my face with her huge bust.  
Suddenly, she sits bolt upright, tenses and lets out a ‚Äòggnnnnrrrhhhgg‚Äô sound, pulsing up and down, grinding and groaning for ten to twenty seconds, biting her lip hard.  
‚ÄúOh my god, sorry, that was too soon‚Äù She says.  ‚ÄúLet me suck you off while I recover for a couple of minutes‚Äù.  
Her oral skills are amazing - licking the top and the shaft, and gently rubbing the bit of the shaft she can‚Äôt swallow.  After no more than a minute, I tap her on the head.  
‚ÄúSorry Sam, I can‚Äôt help it but I‚Äôm going to cum‚Äù  
Without a word, she takes my dick out of her mouth -  ‚ÄúMy god, no wonder my jaw hurts‚Äù - and wraps her enormous breasts around it.  
She squeezes and rubs her huge bust up and down my dick, licking the top as it pokes out.  
I cum in a few seconds, hot, thick ropes all over her face and breasts.  
‚ÄúFuck me, that‚Äôs a lot of cum - clearly a healthy boy!‚Äù  
We both collapse onto my single bed, her huge exposed breasts lolling over her chest and my large erection still persistent.  
‚ÄúWow, that was quick and intense‚Äù, I say.  ‚ÄúHope it wasn‚Äôt over too soon‚Äù.  
‚ÄúWhat do you mean, over?‚Äù, she says, grabbing part of my shaft with her left hand, ‚Äúyou better have loads more in the tank - at least, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told‚Äù  
‚ÄúEh?  What do you mean?  
‚ÄúLet me explain - I know that you fucked - or almost fucked - Mary, the Japanese girl last year.  I was at a girls‚Äô dinner with some of us from the exchange programme and we got to talking about guys.  She mentioned you - and that (pointing to my dick) and gave a description but couldn‚Äôt remember your name.  She said that she wanked you off five times and thought you could still go for more.  I figured out the rest myself based on her description of you, but couldn‚Äôt be sure until now‚Äù  
‚ÄúHa‚Äù (still smooth, but at least this time I‚Äôve got the excuse of being drained).  
‚ÄúYeah, you‚Äôre kind of a myth around a group of us for it. I decided to be the first to take the plunge‚Äù.  
‚ÄúWell, I think I can go again?‚Äù  
‚ÄúOK, big stuff - I want you on top though, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm letting you in from behind and I‚Äôll give myself black eyes bouncing around on top‚Äù.  She removes her knickers and skirt, and it‚Äôs my turn to climb on top of her.    
‚ÄúOnly the tip, babe‚Äù.  She puts her right hand next to her vagina to control how much of my dick I can put into her, and uses the other to help slide me in.  She‚Äôs tight, wet and warm, and I know straight away that I‚Äôm going to cum again really quickly.  
We start to grind and push into each other, deep, open-mouthed kisses raising the passion.  
I pull my back upwards to allow a better angle to slide in deeper, pushing my whole cock in.  She breathes out hard.  I prop myself up with my left arm and squeeze her left breast with my right hand whilst she squeezes her left breast with her left hand.  
Her face flushes and her breathing intensifies, getting deeper and loader.  
‚ÄúOh, oooh, ooaaah, ooaahhh‚Äù she moans, her mouth wide open and eyes bulging.  
Suddenly, I feel her pussy clamp down hard on my cock and convulse, dropping my head between her tits.  Her orgasms set me off again, and with a shuddering climax of my own another round of cum sprays into her as she wraps her legs around me and crushes me tightly to her.  The sensation of her deep kissing, thighs around me, pussy climaxing on me and breasts squashed tight into my face set me off even harder.  
We collapse into a heap on the single bed.    
‚ÄúOh my god‚Äù we both exclaim at the same time.  We lie next to each other, even though there‚Äôs not really enough room for us with her huge breasts taking up so much space.  Her chest rises and falls as her breathing returns to normal.  
‚ÄúI fucking did it‚Äù, she says, pointing at my dick now returning to its normal size ‚ÄúI managed to get us both off so hard that your erection has faded - Mary bet me I couldn‚Äôt!‚Äù  
‚ÄúMary doesn‚Äôt have what you do, Sam‚Äù I say, as she rolls her bust onto my chest and kisses me softly on the lips.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fucking knackered, going to shut my eyes now‚Äù She says.  
The comforting feeling of her breasts gently resting on me helps me get to sleep.  We rest soundly, wake up at about 6am for another couple of rounds and then go our own ways in the way that you do when at University.",eroticliterature,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/pc8p03/sam_mf/,,ilovelambshank,pc8p03,/r/eroticliterature/comments/pc8p03/sam_mf/,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/pc8p03/sam_mf/,1,2021-08-26
I don't know if I should preemptively quit my job or keep collecting a paycheck even if I plan to leave the job as soon as something else becomes available.,"I recently started a new job at a law firm as a paralegal in estate administration where I basically help families who've recently lost a loved one sort through and settle their wills and finances. An agreement when I was hired was that on-the-job training would be provided. I've been there for exactly 71 days (minus weekends and holidays). I like meeting with the clients and helping them with the boring (although practical) issue of dividing estate assets, but for pretty much every other reason, I hate the job. 

Here are the reasons I dislike it in no particular order:

1. The two people who work in the same field as me at this law firm are nice enough people, but they are both overwhelmed with their own workload, and thus never have time to properly train me. (It's worth noting they've never trained another employee before.) This usually results in me doing menial tasks for them or tasks they themselves don't want to do because of how tedious the work is. Ex: Sorting through 2 months worth of 20 different people's bank statements that came in the mail and need to be placed in their file folders and balanced with the checkbook register we maintain for their estate.
2. Two weeks ago I sent this email to my boss and his legal secretary (who basically does his job for him). I've changed the names for privacy. **TLDR: I told them I'm not doing anything at work because no one is teaching me what to do and informed them that I'd like to be more productive at work.**

*""Dear Carson and Molly,*

*I‚Äôm writing to you because I‚Äôm concerned about the pace of my training.*

*I wanted to mention some thoughts on my training thus far and my general workday productivity. I‚Äôm concerned about the depth of my training, not because Emily and Joan aren‚Äôt doing a good job at what they have trained me to do, but because they are both incredibly busy and don‚Äôt seem to have the requisite time necessary to train me as robustly as someone with my experience level needs. I say this because since the day I was hired on June 16th until present I‚Äôve done the same handful of tasks, most of which I‚Äôm able to complete within a two-to-three-hour time frame. Examples of those tasks would be things like entering new client information, setting up a folder, preparing the probate forms and client/beneficiary/bank letters, entering transactions on Lackner for the REV-1500, finding DOD stock values, and running things up to the courthouse or banks.* 

*Because I don‚Äôt have an ‚Äúitinerary‚Äù per se for what the extent of training involves, I don‚Äôt really have a feel for where I‚Äôm at in the training process. If the things I‚Äôve mentioned above are the extent of estate administration, minus the obvious client interaction and explanation of the admin process to clients, I‚Äôm not entirely sure why I‚Äôm going to Fake Name City when I can access Molly's files from the L-Drive. If, and I assume this is the case, there is more to training than this, I‚Äôm curious when those aspects might be introduced and in what timeframe I might expect them to be taught. My primary concern is that if the past 39 days are a foreshadowing of how training will continue, I won‚Äôt be preforming at the level expected of me in an appropriate timeframe due to the pace of learning. My intention in emailing you is addressing this concern before that potentially occurs. Within the past couple of weeks, I‚Äôd have to say I spend a significant amount of my day idle. I do notify Emily and Joan when I complete a task, but at the risk of becoming obnoxious or disruptive, I try not to repetitively tell them I‚Äôm available to work.* 

*I‚Äôm not sure what the solution to this issue should be, especially considering that Emily and Joan cannot simply drop their client files and train me exclusively. I mostly just wanted to make sure upper management/ my boss were aware that this was occurring. If there is anything I can do, individually, to further my training, please let me know. Either way, I would prefer that this communication between us is kept private as much as possible, as I don‚Äôt want to lose the trust of the two people I work with most closely.""*

3. The email resulted in a meeting where several things happened. First, my boss told me 1/2 the problem was mine, and half the problem was the firm's. *Context: In mid-July I was invited to a meeting (which I had no idea was going to happen until it actually happened) where my supervising attorney, coworker, and a legal secretary told me my work wasn't good because I was making too many clerical mistakes. My two mistakes were: I accidentally mailed the same letter to a brother and sister but sent the letterhead addressed to the brother to the sister and vice versa, and I submitted a legal ad to our local newspaper of an estate name that didn't exist because I hybridized the names of two different estates. So one estate was Bill Smith and another estate was Jim Jones, and I submitted an estate ad for Bill Jones. That's it. Everything else was clean. Anyways, the attorney at the meeting insulted my intelligence and essentially asked why my work was so sloppy, to which I replied I was new and had my hands in a lot of different files.* 

So when I was at the second meeting with my boss and his secretary, they brought these mistakes back up as a reason why I wasn't being ""entrusted with more responsibility."" I personally think this is scapegoating for their own poorly structured training schedule, but I nodded in agreement because I'm a sycophantic baby. They then said my coworkers have never had to train anyone before (fairly obvious) and that they would tell them to start giving me more complex cases/ tasks to do. The remedy to filling the huge chunks of my day where I'm not doing anything? Training videos of little significance to me because they're mostly filler and far more involved than anything I've been exposed to yet.

Flash forward two weeks, and I'm still doing the same menial tasks. I refuse to watch the videos, because aside from their irrelevancy, they're also just insanely boring. It might just be that this job is glorified accounting (the last thing in the world I want to do), and that it's never going to work because I'm utterly exhausted by the mundanity of the work. I have six years of higher education and clerical work is just not stimulating enough for me. 

4. The lawyers just fuck off and randomly go golfing or, as one attorney is doing this week, go to the local county fair for 10 hours over a two day span to man a fair booth for the local Republican committee, leaving everyone else to pick up their slack. 

I'm basically at a loss as to whether I should leave before they waste more time and money trying to train someone who ultimately intends to leave as soon as another job interview comes along, or if I should continue to show up and collect a paycheck even though I work sometimes as little as under two hours a day. I almost always come home mentally and emotionally exhausted from the stress of this decision coupled with the insignificant, unfulfilling work of writing letters to creditors or paying a dead person's utility bills.

30[F4M] Two Outcasts/in a fantasy setting. (Descriptive/Literate),"**If this post is up, I‚Äôm still looking. All posts in my post history are also still available to do, too.**

**Note:** *I write multiple paragraphs in third person, but can do first person if need be.* (I on average send 3-4 paragraphs per post but it varies.) *Preferably long-term RP as I can‚Äôt always do back and forth. Patience and an understanding that real life takes precedence is needed from a potential partner. - Writing examples can be provided upon request. - Thank you.*

**I don‚Äôt RP on Reddit solely. I have Kik, Telegram, and Discord!**

The following idea I have is fantasy based. It may seem D&amp;amp;D-esque, but that‚Äôs just my love for fantasy. Lol I‚Äôm not looking to GM or to be GMed, I enjoy cooperative RP. Sharing the world and having fun together. Writing something that we both enjoy is what I‚Äôm really interested in. 

So, my idea is still a bit rough. But I do like it flexible enough to where we can brainstorm together. 

As for my character, I was thinking of something naturistic. I‚Äôll probably build her race and class type around what compliments your character best, but I‚Äôm thinking a ranger/drow, or druidic/elf. - She‚Äôs living on the outskirts of a prosperous kingdom, one of which she has been exiled from. 

Her reason for exile, I am thinking, is she has been dishonored for some reason, and it has been her punishment to leave. - I was thinking she was framed in a crime she did not commit, and has shamefully left. 

As for your character, he can be whoever you‚Äôd like! - But my idea is that he ends up on my characters door step in dire need of help. This could be he‚Äôs badly injured, or overwhelmed by an enemy and seeking refuge? Either way, they come together and are forced to bond this way. - My character can find and heal him, bringing him within her home; and nursing him to health. Which begs to ask, what brought him here? 

I like the idea that he was chased by ex guild members, which he discover corruption in. Or maybe he‚Äôs a rouge and got chased out of the city, unbeknownst to my character, by guards. 

But now our characters are cozy together. Two outcasts in a fantasy setting. To add spice the ones who chased your character off can find us and force us to go on the run at some point. What do we even have to lose? Maybe we can make something of ourselves elsewhere?

**Kinks** Dom/sub, Master/slave, giving oral sex, (deep throat, passionate) teasing, dirty talk, grinding, outercourse, edging, orgasm control and denial, incest, sleep play, mutual masturbation, big cum shots, cream pies, (no pregnancy) light pain, romance, vaginal, anal, and more. 

**Limits** scat, gore, vore, excessive feet stuff, pregnancy and birth, inflation, lactation, group, maybe more. 

I don‚Äôt expect all kinks to be included or shared. 

**Again, I don‚Äôt RP on Reddit solely. I have Kik, Telegram, and Discord!**

My song by song review of Weezer (black),"#Before reading this, please consider the fact the Weezer (black) is my least favorite Weezer album, so there won‚Äôt be much positivity in this review.

*introduction* - Yesterday, I was home sick waiting for the test results and didn‚Äôt have much to do after finishing my schoolwork. I decided I would listen to my least favorite Weezer album on good speakers to see if my opinion would change or further solidify. One of my biggest problems with this album was that the horrid mixing caused me to get a headache when listening to it with my headphones, a trait no other Weezer album shares. I will say that the bad song count went from 9 to 6 and that I did appreciate the album more with better speakers than headphones. Please don‚Äôt murder me for my opinions. Without further ado, I shall begin the review.

*can‚Äôt knock the hustle* - 4/10 | This is a great album opener. It gets you prepared for what you are about to listen to, and does a good job at gaining your attention. The distorted acoustic guitar at the beginning along with horns makes for an interesting arrangement, and my ears like it. I‚Äôm not big fan of the lyrics ‚Äúhasta luego, hasta luego, hasta luego ad√≠os‚Äù but that may just be my bias against this album. I also like the 12 string in what I think is the bridge, as it adds another different flavour to the song. I really like the instrumental of this song at the beginning, but after the intro nothing really happens other than the bridge. There are a few songs on this album that suffer from sounding pretty cool, but then losing their cool factor as the song goes on. This suffers most from this, which is why a minute in it becomes an ok song, and by two minutes it becomes bad. This song starts of great, and the verse instrumentation is very cool too, with the ear candy thrown in at different parts where Rivers isn‚Äôt singing‚Ä¶ BUT Rivers is singing. With the introduction of the vocals come the problems. Rivers is singing in some weird robotic voice and cuts off all of his syllables sharply, which doesn‚Äôt do the song any good. This odd vocal style is throughout the song except for the chorus, and it makes the chorus worse as the production changes slightly for this second vocal style and the addition of horns. I also need to address something about the lyrics on a few songs from this album. I believe there are four or five songs that use heavy cursing, and the use of these with no meaning damages the image that these songs create. Can‚Äôt knock the hustle is a song about someone who works hard with little pay (well, thats what it seems to be). For contrast, 1 more hit is a song about drugs taking over someones life. We also have the line ‚Äúdon‚Äôt step to me, don‚Äôt step to me, don‚Äôt step to me, \b*tch‚Äù. I‚Äôm not usually a stickler for lyrics, but seriously? I feel like if this song had a bit different production and lyrics, it could probably end up more dynamic and I would like it better. 

*zombie \b*st*rds * - 2/10 | This song starts off with a cool acoustic guitar tone, but holy crap is this song cheesy sounding. It‚Äôs the same reason I don‚Äôt like all of the good ones. The Prechorus sounds pretty cool, but it gets ruined by the production. The entire song sounds like a cheesy pop song made to be number 1 on the charts, but got lost on the way there. Almost like imagine dragons mixed with whatever single happens to be popular right now. There are certain lyrics that are very generic and repeating them just makes it like every other alt pop song, like ‚Äúwelcome to the jungle to the jungle‚Äù and ‚Äúwe can go up, we can go down‚Äù. The chorus melody isn‚Äôt very strong, although here I‚Äôm actually fine with it because it means I don‚Äôt have to deal with an earworm to a song I hate. I do absolutely despise the piano part in the chorus. It is so repetitive and it doesn‚Äôt add anything to the song other a headache. This song may have the worst production on the album due to the noise in the background of the piano part. It‚Äôs so loud and it‚Äôs so grating on my psyche. The bridge is probably the only salvageable piece of this song that could be called ‚Äúgood‚Äù without any changes. I heard song and can‚Äôt know the hustle when the album came out, and I listened to them with my dad‚Ä¶ ugh. I hate this song, but not as much as another song on this album. 

*High as a Kite* - 9/10 | This song is very good, and the only thing I would change is maybe making it rock out a little more in the bridge. This song‚Äôs video is worth mentioning because of the way it perfectly matches the mood of the song. The synths and guitar work together instead of against each other, and it comes out very clean. The gentle verses transition into the anthemic choruses, and the bridge does exactly what a bridge should do. The melody of the verses is so happy sounding, and you get a truly melancholic feeling when the angrier choruses and bridges come in. While I‚Äôm fairly sure this song is about drugs, this one doesn‚Äôt curse, so I‚Äôm happy with that. The only thing is I can‚Äôt wish for more songs like this one, because when I do I get the second worst weezer song in existence. This is a great song, and if I made playlists it would be added. I don‚Äôt have as much to say about the better songs on this album because I feel the need to explain why I hate certain things more than I love others.

*living in l.a.* - 4/10 | This song suffers from the same main problem as zombie \b*st*rds. It sounds like a cheesy alt rock hit made for radio. If I could compare it to something, it reminds me of songs from when I was younger, like Pompeii and some Maroon 5 stuff that was popular then. The problem with this song is that while it should be more nostalgic to me, the production gives it an odd feel that just doesn‚Äôt vibe with me. This song has a stronger chorus melody, and I‚Äôm fine with it due to the inoffensive nature of the song. The verses are pretty so-so, with some generic pop guitar and quiet vocals. It seems like they tried to make a relevant alternative song and just sorta failed. I do like this song more than others not the album, but it‚Äôs not a very high margin.

*piece of \sh*t * - 0/10 | This song is literally the second worst Weezer song.  It‚Äôs already trying to copy the success of high as a kite but with a poppier twist, something that it does not do well in. The piano sounds good, but the flutes and guitars take away from the piano, and the vocals are worse than love is the answer. The constantly repeated melody line of ‚Äúshe cut me like a piece of cake‚Äù gets stuck in my head for so long and I hate it so much. The ‚Äúdoot doo do do do doot doo‚Äù line is so fricking stupid and and adds another crappy earworm that makes me hate this song, and the album. The song literally opens with ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do hard drugs, solve our problems‚Äù wtf rivers!? The piano melody tries to convince me that maybe this song sounds good, but then when I think about any other ‚Äúpiece‚Äù of this song, I get one of the absolute trash earworms and m brought back to the state of hate. How did this song ever see the light of day? As I‚Äôm thinking about this song, my face turned to disgust. I hate this song so much. Thank you for coming to my Weez talk.

*i‚Äôm just being honest* - 4/10 | This song suffers from the same problem as can‚Äôt knock the hustle. Nothing much happens in this song, so once the first chorus hits, it enters ok territory, and then bad territory once we get to the bridge. It‚Äôs almost like a song from hurley, but if hurley was as bad as people say it is. Other than the intro, there isn‚Äôt much of a dynamic in the song, so it just feels very same throughout the song. Even the bridge which is supposed to have some sort of breakdown doesn‚Äôt feel that way because the high pitched guitars with all the reverb stay there and the bass gets louder. This song is really just alright, and it could be a lot better. It lacks any real drive to listen to, and this makes it bad. I will say that the intro and outro riff is pretty cool, although I wish it was in more of the song.

*Too many thoughts in my head* - 8/10 | Well this song is good. I‚Äôm not too big of a fan of the vocal production in the verses, but it has a cool chorus, and the lead guitar is really cool. The intro instrumental is really cool, and reminds me a little bit of the osees. The verse quietness mixed with the louder choruses is really cool, and I‚Äôm a fan of that descending vocal line toward the end. The bridge brings down the dynamic, but in a much better way than i‚Äôm just being honest. The outro is very good, and the guitar through out the song with whatever effect it has (I think it‚Äôs wah-wah) is just perfect for this song. I wish there were more songs like this one on the album.

*The Prince Who Wanted Everything* - 8/10 | This is definitely one of the better songs on this album. It would be 8/10 if it had more dynamic range, but all really just sits in one spot. The guitars sound really good in this song, and I like the little ‚Äúdo doo doo do‚Äùs that are thrown every once in a while. It has a nice beat, and I can move to this song, so I‚Äôm happy. The song has a nice melody that goes well with the guitar riff, and the chorus is very memorable. The bridge adds a good little minor section to the song to take away from the happiness that the music lets out especially since the lyrics are about prince dying (right?). This isn‚Äôt the *best* song on the album, because it could definitely be a little better, but it is pretty dang good.

*Byzantine* - 10/10 | This is by far the best song on the album. I wish I had listened to it more when I hated this album. I probably couldn‚Äôt stand the background noise from the drums. All of the instruments flow together, and everything just sounds so NICE. The vocal riff at the beginning and throughout the song is addictive, and the drums fill the space in a good way (unlike zombie \b*st*rds). The guitar parts thrown in every once in a while give the song an almost islandy vibe, and it is so pleasing to my ears. The bridge adds a darker dynamic to such a light song, and it provides just the right amount of tension to allow for another great chorus to come in. Vocal melody of the chorus is catchy, and verses are so chill. This song is like a drug, it kills my pain and I wanna listen to it more and more and more. If there was one thing I would change about this song, it would be the lyrics in the verses, cause the random f word and the sex appeal of your sick dance moves are kinda mood killing on the first few listens. Holy cow this is a good song.

*california snow* - 4/10 | Let me start off with the good stuff in this song. The intro with the weird sound and the bass stuff is cool. The ‚ÄúWOO woo ^woo ^^woo‚Äù is very cool, and the chorus has a very nice and catchy melody. It‚Äôs pretty poppy, and sounds a little bit like a darker song from pacific daydream. Now for the stuff I don‚Äôt like. The verses are very ok, and I do not like the bridge. The actual singing rivers does in the intro is weird and it causes me to feel uncomfortable. The kinda of chorus before the second chorus is kinda cool, but it fits in an uncanny valley of whether I hate it or I like it. The production on the intro is alright, but the rest of the song is pretty bad. The outro is also pretty weak. This song has cool parts, but I don‚Äôt like many things about it, causing me to think of it as bad.

*verdict* - This album is indeed very bad, as there six songs I can‚Äôt really see myself wanting to listen to again on them. I wish there were more songs like Too Many Thoughts in My Head and Byzantine, because they have a good vibe that could‚Äôve led to something cooler. In headphones this album is one of the worst produced things I‚Äôve ever heard, comparable to Sleep‚Äôs Holy Mountain, but on better speakers I don‚Äôt have to worry about that. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get over hating can‚Äôt knock the hustle or zombie b*st*rds due to my first experience with it, similar to undone, but I do think the album had more good songs than I remembered. I would sit this album at a 4/10, and would probably never want to listen to the whole thing again ever.

Front driver side wheel is getting REALLY hot,"Visiting home for a week of PTO from work and my dad let me know he needed help with his truck 
(2011 Ford F-150 XLT 3.5L 4x4)  he said he thought the front driver side wheel was getting hot so he replaced the brakes. (Caliper, rotors, pads) last week. He‚Äôs been driving it this week and it gets so hot it turned the caliper a different color and you can smell it burning. 

I took it all back apart and replaced the caliper and pads that were already worn half way down thinking that the new caliper was sticking and put it all back together with the new parts and‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.it is still getting super hot and burning. I‚Äôve got it all back apart again waiting for the parts store to get the hub assembly I just had them order thinking it may be the wheel bearing. The wheel had no play in it and no noise and the bearing seemed to be fine once I got the old one out but I have no idea what else it could be? I‚Äôm gonna put the new hub in it tomorrow without much hope of it fixing the problem. 

Any ideas on what else it could be?

If they bring all the better spider men in, i feel like it will take the spotlight from Tom and i want to give Tom a chance, i don't like hating any spider man material.

29 [M4F] Hot days and Quiet nights,"On warm days you can always catch me sleepily day dreaming. I have a knack for procrastination, I mean ever since I was little it seemed that way. In the 4th grade I wrote a book report the night it was due on a book I had never read. Got an A though, so maybe I am good under pressure? It's not like it has stopped me from going after my goals in life though. I have achieved both a Bachelors' degree and Master's degree, and am currently pursuing some new job opportunities because of it.

While going through college I developed a passion for cooking, I love finding and trying all types of new cuisine. My favorite is Italian, and being able to make my own fresh pizza dough, or pasta is a total game changer. I worked in elder care while studying, and learned a long the way how to fix just about everything in a house, becoming quite the handy man as well. I actually just made an awesome cat tree for my new kitten, and her and me are both quite happy how it turned out. 

In my free time, I am a total home body, love playing games with my friends on my computer, or watching YouTube, or anime. I read quite a lot of manga as well. Out doorsy stuff I enjoy is riding my bike, or going hiking. I live in Colorado so being able to go up into the mountains or a national park is always a treat a try to take advantage of. 

For what I look like, I have no problem sending pictures, but I'll give a brief description here. I am 6ft, with honestly a great body, and handsome face. I lucked out for sure. I have two different colored eyes, and a beard. 

I am just hoping to find someone to connect with, it is one thing I do not want to procrastinate on. I want to find that special someone. If you share any of the same interests with me that would be great, but you will get extra points if you think traveling around the world in a converted van would be super awesome, it is what I always day dream about.",ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/pcbcqm/29_m4f_hot_days_and_quiet_nights/,,Vincent_1992,pcbcqm,/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/pcbcqm/29_m4f_hot_days_and_quiet_nights/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/pcbcqm/29_m4f_hot_days_and_quiet_nights/,1,2021-08-26
Leaving public accounting and need advice on a complicated situation,"All of this has transpired over the 2 years I've been with this firm and I'm only hitting some highlights to give you an idea of what I've been dealing with. 

I work for a medium sized firm in a remote office with 4 other people. There's a larger office about 2 1/2 hours away. They have a person managing the small office I'm in, whom I've had to report to the managing partner and the head of HR (who is now also a partner) multiple times. Both the managing partner and the head of HR sit in the larger office 2 1/2 hours away. First it was for being drunk at work several times. She then went on medical leave and told them she was going into an in-state rehab facility. Just before she left she told me she was actually going to stay at home and get sobered up. She said she's been through it before and knows how to do it. I told the managing partner and HR that she wasn't going into a facility. They didn't make her submit proof of anything. So moving on, she comes back to work and I continue to get some serious client complaints about her. These clients are so upset that they tell me they don't want an email or phone call from her ever again. I talk with the managing partner and HR about this. Then another co-worker (not a CPA or trained accountant who works in our bookkeeping dept) comes to me and tells me she's literally sick because this same person has been having her do things that she thinks aren't right. For example, a client's bookkeeper emails our bookkeeper and says a shareholder of the C-Corp would like to take a dividend of $20K and asks which account to book it to. Our bookkeeper forwards it to this person and she says book it to rent so it doesn't get double taxed. She also had our bookkeeper deleting cash transactions from a client's books. Our bookkeeper eventually just stopped doing it. The work around was this person disconnected the square account from QBO so transactions wouldn't post automatically and told our bookkeeper to enter sales strictly from what deposits hit the bank. There were so many more unethical things going on that this co-worker shared with me. I told her I needed to report these things and she agreed and agreed to talk directly with the managing partner and HR. I talked with them first and they had no desire to talk with the person who experienced these things directly and didn't address the person causing the issues directly. Their solution was to do a 30 minute firm sponsored CPE on business expenses, hoping it would educate the person. WTF.

So I started looking for a new job and got one quickly!! One I'm super excited about. Senior Accountant in a standalone organization where I'll get full state benefits (pension and all) and I won't need to manage anyone AND the pay...I thought I'd need to take a pay cut, but I'm only making $473 less per year and with my benefits I come out way better in the end. So I gave two weeks and that's not super cool right before the 9/15 and 10/15 deadlines. On top of that they announced that they just acquired another firm and there's going to be extra work for everyone during the deadlines.

So, my delimma...they're telling clients and people internally that I'm exiting public accounting. That's fine, it's true and it makes sense. However, when the HR person became a partner, two other people did as well and there's a 5th partner too that's getting ready to transition out. The other 3 partners do not know about any of the stuff that really caused me to leave and they think I'm just a jerk because I'm leaving at a bad time. How do I uphold my professional reputation in a professional way?? I dream about telling the other partners (I also think they have the right to know), or at least telling them there's much more behind the reason I'm leaving. But I also don't want to look like I'm trying to create drama on my way out. Or should I just walk away and let people think whatever they want about me? I don't see a good, clean solution but I'm also so exhausted by it that I thought I'd throw it out there to see if someone with an outside perspective could come up with one. Serious answers will be greatly appreciated!!!",Accounting,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/pcolrd/leaving_public_accounting_and_need_advice_on_a/,Advice,magicabounds,pcolrd,/r/Accounting/comments/pcolrd/leaving_public_accounting_and_need_advice_on_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/pcolrd/leaving_public_accounting_and_need_advice_on_a/,5,2021-08-27

‚Äî‚ÄîTRIGGER WARNING‚Äî- strict parents,"This post does involve possible(?) abuse, self harm and suic***

Hi, this is my first post here. I am 20 F 
I won‚Äôt say I had abusive parents but I‚Äôve been told that they were. And the older I get I see and can understand so much more and I can‚Äôt help but just want to get this all out where it can‚Äôt come back to me because a lot of this my parents still refuse to see where they went wrong and it‚Äôs all somehow still my fault. I just don‚Äôt want to fight anymore. But here I go. 

It was often just my brother and I because they both worked so often. My brother feels like I raised him, I don‚Äôt think I raised him because i didn‚Äôt pay for anything and mum and dad were there‚Ä¶but I can say it definitely felt like it was him and I against the world we weren‚Äôt allowed to go see friends on school holidays, after school activities were always a no because they worked so much, although I am happy we got so much time together tho because we have always been the best of friends. And he was my rock when crap got CRAZY. 
We never went without the necessities,we definitely had to earn them though, They cut the power off every night for some reason for a few weeks I can‚Äôt even remember why now but It was for the sake of earning that right there is more but we won‚Äôt get into that lol. But we always had money, our family wasn‚Äôt rich but my dad was/ is in the mines and my mum was high up where she worked. 
 when I was 13 my mum locked me out of the house and stood there hysterically laughing at me wanting to come back in because I hadn‚Äôt done all the washing,to be fair though I did have all day to do it so there really wasn‚Äôt any excuse why I hadn‚Äôt done it I get that now. But I had a cold and it was cold outside I was crying. I hit the window trying to get her to stop, I accidentally put my arm through it and cut my wrist pretty badly (I ended up needing 14 stitches) 
I guess she was probably in shock a bit too because everything that happened was pretty crazy up to that point but she threw a towel at me and angrily called my dad who worked away, they both collectively yelled at me until we got to the hospital. I was so angry at her I didn‚Äôt even want to get the stitches I just wanted to go I ran off into the park and a nurse has to almost drag me in. 
I had to pay for the window from a bank account I was never allowed to see but my nan had put a bit of money in, still to this day I‚Äôve never seen the account but apparently that paid for the window. 
That was where it all went upside down, I rebelled something nuts, I had been controlled so darn much that I snapped. And my mum has said since that people used to say to them my brother and I were just going to snap one day, and guess what? We BOTH did. 
I didn‚Äôt smoke anything while I still lived with my parents, I hasn‚Äôt even tried it I was literally under 14 (kicked out at 14 which I now understand is because I was unbearable to live with, and trust me I was) 
They went through my room when I was at school, they once had the police come and search my room, absolutely CONVINCED I waa smoking weed. My mum went as far to say I was snorting a deodorant can that she found half empty in there(?) so as you can imagine the contents of my room was often emptied out, whether I had bought it,had it gifted or someone else‚Äôs. They didn‚Äôt care, if it‚Äôs under THEIR roof they automatically own it and I must do the right thing to keep it. 
I took up self harm, and being so secretive over that made them think I really was doing drugs, I lost my bedroom door, my music (going through a real goth phase at the time) and my phone got a hammer through it. 
One day my mum and I were having one of our many fights we were fighting everyday at that point. And I just told her, idk why I wanted to just be left alone I was sick of the constant and fine tuned control, at the age I was I felt like a slave left to stay home and clean up after everyone (Im sure my brother felt the same but I won‚Äôt tell his story) I couldn‚Äôt even enjoy the things that should wind me down I was in constant fear of it being held against me, broken or taken. And it was. I didn‚Äôt eat fast enough and there went my books because she had already taken everything else for two weeks. 
The reactions I had to a lot of these things are probably what caused a lot of my punishments to get more and more extreme but even when I was younger and obeyed without argument and just did my best there was still a reason to take it from me. 
Anyway when she found out about the self harm I was then an attention seeker. I started misbehaving in all parts of my life. 
Until I tried u nalive, I still feel sick I did that to mt brother. Idon‚Äôt have memories of him seeing anything but I remember him sitting on the end of my hospital bed drawing me pictures to try make me happy and telling me not to do it again. 
After I got out of hospital I went home, obviously my room had been emptied out, I was angry about that and voiced it so they dropped me off at a mental ward for a month. I was told I was going to see my friend that had moved to the same town the year prior I did see her to be fair. 
I now understand a lot of the reasons they did that but it honestly really affected me. I wouldn‚Äôt even get in a car with them for a few years because my trust had been shattered. 
When I got out I was constantly threatened to be sent back. It was terrible. I know a lot of my actions caused a lot of these things to happen I really do but I just wish it wasn‚Äôt so harsh and so quick. 
I see how a lot of my friends and other people parent their kids and I get angry at these kids sometimes? Like when they do something and a parent reacts in a healthy way without threats of punishments or something I feel like ‚Äúwell if I did this, this is what I would have had gotten‚Äù 
It SUCKS feeling like this. I don‚Äôt know how to stop them. Idek if it‚Äôs jealousy or something stupid or maybe I‚Äôm just like my parents. 
And that‚Äôs a shitty excuse. I need to get over this, I‚Äôm starting to realise that Maybe I did go through abuse maybe they weren‚Äôt just strict? Mix of both maybe?
I walk through life now thinking every thing I do is wrong. Or what‚Äôs the point. 
I hide the weirdest things from my boyfriend who I‚Äôve been with for three years he‚Äôs great and he never gets annoyed when I ask him ‚Äúare you mad?‚Äù 10x a day. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
If I get Uber eats for lunch I hide all evidence of it. He has not once said something but I‚Äôd be in trouble for not cooking for myself at my parents. 
I spend my entire day off from work making sure this house looks like a show home, he‚Äôs never said anything but at my parents they‚Äôd go off and say I ‚Äúhalf do‚Äù everything. 
That‚Äôs not even the tip of the ice burg but I‚Äôve already said so much and I doubt anyone has gotten this far lol 
It took years for me to talk to my parents again after they kicked me out, I made a couple of bad decisions and I refused to ask for their help, and can still say I preferred sleeping in the park than to going home. 
I ended up with this 26 year old when I was 17 and he was abusive, straight back to not being allowed out of the house except this guy was worst. I remember he burnt my arm with a lighter because a customer at my work hugged me, he was disabled and really enjoyed seeing me every week and I had actually known him longer than the 26yr old. 
Anyway. Long story short I had to go back to my parents because things for REALLY bad but I won‚Äôt get into details and lasted 8 months. Straight back into what I had always known as my parents home. Despite them promising to change. 
So I moved out and stayed out, I still talk to my parents but I live 10 hours from them, I love them don‚Äôt get me wrong, but certainly have some what I think might be psychological damage because of the way I think and react now I seriously only know how to react with anger and bitterness. Always have been. Thankfully I was also raised to keep my mouth shut. Hahaha
If they had just worked with me or helped me understand rather than punish me until I get it right I‚Äôd probably not have these issues as bad but it might also be me trying to shift blame. 
I still don‚Äôt make friends and now I genuinely don‚Äôt want to leave my house. Maybe that‚Äôs just me but I think a lot of it is to do with my upbringing and obviously some of the silly decisions I made. 
I‚Äôm so sick of living like this and being confused if I‚Äôm still angry with them or not. I can‚Äôt talk to them about it because even though we get along when I talk about how things were we argue so I think this is probably something I‚Äôll never be able to get out of me. 
I

This turned so long and probably confusing I needed to just vomit these feelings and memories just kept going in and out of my head there‚Äôs just so much. I‚Äôm sorry if nobody can understand it‚Äôs just nice to have it all out there this is very much just a word vomit. I hope I don‚Äôt sound spoilt because I definitely was compared to other children.",Vent,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/pccr4o/trigger_warning_strict_parents/,,Anonanonanonthx,pccr4o,/r/Vent/comments/pccr4o/trigger_warning_strict_parents/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/pccr4o/trigger_warning_strict_parents/,0,2021-08-27
[M4F] Family vacation at the enchanted beach house,"""Are you guys ready for our beach vacation?"" Paul asks to the rest of the van as he drives.

""I still don't see why we have to do this,"" Zoe responds. ""Could have just a good a time at home. Better, even.""

""Now Zoe,"" Lisa says from the front seat. ""There's no need to be so gloomy. This is our last summer before Isaac goes to college, so it's a good time for one more vacation! Who knows the next time we'll get to have an opportunity like this.""

""Whatever. At least I'll have a room to myself,"" Zoe says, rolling her eyes and putting her earbuds in.

Isaac, sitting next to Zoe, is enjoying himself reading his book, before looking around himself appearing slightly confused. ""Hey Mark,"" he says, turning to the back seat. ""Have you seen my headphones?""

""They're probably in you bag in the trunk,"" Mark, the oldest brother, replies, not looking up from his phone.

""Well, could you look for me?""

""Busy."" Mark continues swiping on his phone.

Isaac sighs loudly, turning forward and getting back into his book.

""I'm sure they'll warm up more once we get there,"" Lisa says softly to her husband. ""Riding in the car so much is just building up stress. It'll all be good once we get some time to unwind.""

""I hope so,"" Paul says. He turns to Lisa a gives her a brief smile. ""We'll just have to see how it goes.""

***

""Hey, Lisa, do you know where Zoe's at? I checked in her room upstairs, and she wasn't in there.""

""Mmm... Have you checked the boys' room? She's been spending a lot of time in there. Ahh, a little higher baby... Ohhh, right there~. What did you need her for?""

""I was gonna see if she could help me out with a little problem.""

""Yes, I can see that, though I don't know if 'little' is the word I'd use. Oh, yes! Keep going, right there, Isaac~""

Paul turns and heads back upstairs while his wife's moans fill the room behind him. He gets to the top and opens the unlocked door to his sons' room. Do these doors even have locks? He hadn't thought to check.

""Oh, fuck! God, that feels so good!""

""Yeah, you like having your ass filled like that?""

""Yes, please don't stop...""

Paul knocks on the wall as he steps into the room. ""I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Do you mind if I join in?""

""Of course not, Dad. Plenty of openings to be filled, go ahead and pick...""

***

Hi there! Hope you got a good idea of what this idea is about from that. Basically, the idea that won't leave my head is some kind of vacation house that is ""enchanted."" Whether it's cursed or blessed is really a matter of perspective, maybe it's even haunted. In any case, it has the peculiar effect on its residents of making them all incredibly horny, as well as removing all of their inhibitions that would stop them from doing what they need to do to take care of their sexual urges.

I really like this with the aspect that none of them *realize* that something weird is going on; it just becomes natural to them to do what they need to do. So less of, ""Why do I feel so aroused all of a sudden? Why can't I stop myself?"" and more of, ""Gosh, I'm really horny right now. I'm gonna take my pants off and take care of that. What, you're *also* taking your pants off? Well that's really convenient!""

Ok, probably not *that* in-your-face, but you get the idea.

I'd love to RP this or just chat about some of the scenarios that could arise from this situation. We could start when the family gets to the beach house, or just pick right up in the middle of their stay there if you wanna get straight into the smut; I'm open to your thoughts! How long did it take them all to get naked when they first got there? Who all's in the shower right now? What exactly did Paul walk in on upstairs? So many interesting questions to explore...

We could also have it where the house grants additional ""blessings"" to its residents during their stay. Maybe it just increases their stamina to let them keep going longer or grants them additional endowments, increasing sizes and their capacity to handle them. This is totally optional, but let me know if it's something you're interested in!

Some of my kinks are: incest, group, bi play/orientation play (both ways), outercourse, handjobs, titjobs, oral, vaginal, anal, DP, cumplay, big cumshots, multiple cumshots/low refractory period, big cocks, big tits, squirtin, taboo relationships. Most of these are optional, so don't worry if you're not a fan of any that aren't inherent to this prompt. Limits are noncon, violence, toilet stuff, beast, and snuff

For the more meta stuff, I'm less concerned with how long your responses are directly, and more with how well you can move the story forward with me and include some of your own ideas. I think it's the most fun when we're both contributing and enjoying ourselves! I'm open to the structure for character control as well, whether we want to split them up somehow or share control over all of them. If you want to change the number of characters or otherwise adjust the family structure, just let me know. I'm not strongly attached to the way I presented it here.

"[B4T] [V4V] [Multiple Plots] Come Dominate a Shy, Submissive Guy","Hello! I am a 28-year-old roleplayer, looking for some short or long-term roleplays. If you send me a message, I expect that you will be over 20, as well as all characters involved (I don't want to roleplay/chat with teenagers. That's weird.) I'm looking for dominant dudes - the cockier, snarkier, and nastier, the better! Meaning, I want something rough, fellas ;)  
  
When it comes to sex, I'm fairly vanilla. I like the idea of very lightly getting into kinks (light bondage, for example). I do have some kinks that I would very much like to introduce into the roleplay, which include voyeurism and exhibitionism (risky/semi-public sex/nudity, almost getting caught), humiliation/degradation, cuckolding, rough sex, name calling, age gaps. (If we're going for a longer roleplay, I love the idea of the dominant guy becoming more kind after sex/giving proper after care as the two continue with their relationship.) As for limits - I just don't care for depraved shit or nonconsensual shit.  
  
\- I'm not picky when it comes to what type of character you use. You wanna be a furry? Monster? Alien? Go for it! Just no bestiality, obviously.  
  
\- PLEASE let me know if you have any limits/triggers! As stated twice before, I'm pretty vanilla when it comes to sex, and I also don't care for major gore or violence. Please please let me know if you have any triggers.  
  
\- I won't be able to reply every day. I have work and school coming up, as I'm sure most of y'all do as well, so that shit comes first unfortunately, lol.  
  
\- Even if the plot/prompt we go with is mostly sex-related, I'd like some story, too! Let's set the scene! Let's have some story with our smut!  
  
\- PLEASE no chat requests. Send me a DM! I'm more than happy to roleplay via Reddit DM, or on Discord!  
  
The character I plan to use for roleplays is Wendell. He is a rather submissive yes-man who puts the needs and feelings of others in front of his own. Those who interact with him find out quickly that he‚Äôs bad at hiding his emotions. Wendell is shy and gets flustered easily, and doesn't often date. He rather burry himself in school and/or work. In the privacy of his own home, Wendell doesn't allow himself to indulge in many fantasies... and he's a bit shy about the fact that his package is a little on the smaller side ‚Äì something some might not expect from a guy who‚Äôs 6‚Äô 4‚Äù. He‚Äôs a thin person, with thin and angular features. His blonde hair is almost always combed and styled sensibly, and he‚Äôs always got a pair of glasses resting on his narrow nose. His eyes are a bright blue. He tends to dress very strait-laced and snappily, most outfits consisting of dress pants, button up shirts, sweater-vests, bowties, and a snazzy pair of Oxfords. (Depending on how much plotting we want to do and which prompt and pairing we go with, Wendell's back story can get a little dark, too, with him having been in prison for a short while.)  
  
So, he's going to be the one your character is paired with! Hope you're into a guy who's not the 'typical bottom.' ;) Also, he'll need to be pretty comfortable with your character before he takes on any sort of 'top' role, but it's certainly not out of the question\~  
  
Here are my favorite plots, at the moment!  
  
\- Intern/Secretary x Boss:  
  
A.) MC has been with this banking company a long time. So long, in fact, that he'd managed to climb up the ranks and become a very important figure within the company. Though the part doesn't suit him very well, MC still loves his job and does it well. Unfortunately... some responsibilities are getting to be a little much, so he hires an intern to be his personal assistant - YC. YC isn't shy when it comes to being flirty, and as MC comes to find out, YC isn't shy about being forward or bold about what they want, either. The teasing, the flirting, and the suggestive comments turn serious one night while the two work late, and that one moment of passion turns their relationship into something much more complicated... and exhilarating. (This could be fun for a college student x professor type roleplay, too)  
  
B.) MC is the new guy in the office. He's taken the role of the private secretary to YC, who happens to be the CEO of the company. For a little while things go as they normally would, but as YC and mine continue to interact, MC becomes enamored with YC. He starts becoming a bit of a peeping tom, and at times, kind of a creep, as much as MC hates to admit it. He's been able to hide his bad behavior, until one day he's caught 'taking care of himself' by YC - and on the job, too. Now, YC has this to hold over his head. (This plot can also go with a headmaster x professor plot, where YC is the head of the school and mine is the professor.)  
  
\- Bully x Bullied:  
  
\* This is my favorite pairing at the moment! I'd be more than happy to think up some more fun plots for this one!  
  
MC has been harassed by YC since the very beginning. All four years of high school had been awful, with the teasing, the name calling, the mocking, and sometimes, the physical abuse. But now? Now they were both high school graduates! And MC would never have to see YC again! MC was more than ready to start fresh and get on with his life! He had a whole summer's worth of adventures to go on, and he'd also gotten into one of his dream schools! So, that summer goes by, and MC has really blossomed after being set free from high school. When the new year of college rolls around, MC finds his way to his dorm, and sees that his new roommate is there! But as soon as MC lays eyes on said roommate, the excitement MC feels is taken over by fear, as MC sees that his roommate is YC.  
  
\- Prisoner x Guard:  
  
MC has been thrown into the slammer, after having made some very poor decisions. It's clear, too, that he does not fit in, and isn't a typical prisoner. The other prisoners find it both easy and fun to pick on him, and it only gets worse when they find out what he'd done. To top it all off, MC gets along much better with the officers, than he does with the other prisoners. That's how YC and MC meet. MC practically begs YC for protection, or at the very least, help. YC is willing to give this help, but... for a price.  
  
Other ideas I really dig:  
  
\- Wendell being a peeping tom/being peeped on  
  
\- Being catfished/catfishing  
  
\- Step-dad x step-son

[M4A] The Goddess of Incest Just Moved Into Your Neighborhood,"The ugly home at the center of the neighborhood had finally sold. Finally, the eyesore would be torn down and replaced with something lavish. But when a voluptuous woman in a flowing white dress arrived, the community was shocked to see her simply move in. No wealthy husband followed. No grating sounds of construction in the mornings.

Alone, the stranger tended her barren garden. When she wasn't outside she could often be heard within, singing amidst her decaying little home. Disbelief turned to irritation. But the woman's smile was disarming. Her eyes were welcoming. Flowing hair and dresses gave her a regal quality, while her soothing voice compelled one to safely offload all fears and anxieties. The stranger would listen and advise.

Though she was easy to open up to, the conversations could be difficult. No matter the topic, she'd always find a way to shift it. Work and casual relationships didn't interest her. Every problem had to have its roots traced back to some deeper meaning.

""How's your relationship with your brother?"" she might've asked. ""Are you as close as you'd like to be?""

A growing amount of women made their rounds to the derelict home. Her popularity grew and so did her garden. Greenery overtook the fences, the chipped walls. Sweet flowers blossomed and a pleasant scent spread wider and wider across the neighborhood. It was invigorating in the morning, relaxing in the evening, but there was a restlessness when the sun set. It persisted even in one's dreams.

In those dreams one would wander a labyrinth of the mundane, guided by sweet singing and flowers. To follow was to find fulfillment and power. And family. Fathers with straining bulges. Mothers in nothing but aprons. Brothers and sisters escaping the traps of their relationships to find perfection in one another.

Dulled by days of stress and instant gratification, most forgot their dreams. Others woke in cold sweats, with lust leaking onto their bedsheets. Some ignored it while others gave in. And those who did realized that giving permission to those forbidden thoughts offered strange rewards. Mr. Grouse across the street found his cock straining more powerfully than it had in decades, and trembled at the realization that he'd just whispered his daughter's name. The more he said it the more he throbbed. Next door, Mrs. Jordan, numbed by the dullness of her day to day, stood blushing and naked in her bathroom with a perfect string of wetness hanging between her weakened knees. Curiosity had brought her far, but at the cusp of something wonderful she immersed herself in cold water to fight off the forbidden. Another moment of picturing her son's cock and she knew she'd be cumming without even touching herself.

When morning came and the flowers smelled as invigorating as fresh coffee, eyes met around kitchen tables. Fearful and awkward, one would wonder if their thoughts were somehow known. And while some were indeed still blissfully ignorant, you were not alone. But some practically floated over to the stranger's house in adoration, finding their satisfaction and fortune looking up.

I need advice bad on my rights as a mother and what to do with this POS father of my son,"So, I dealt with abuse from my estranged husband and still deal with it to this day, more mental now than anything but that can be just as bad if not worse. We have a 7 year old together, whom he didn't want AT ALL and tried numerous times to push me down the stairs while pregnant and only was fine when I told him a family member was going to take him from me for adoption even though that's not what I wanted to do. But when the time came I couldnt do it. He didn't help me at all and I moved back in with my parents when my son was an infant. I had terrible post partum and my drug use/mental state went spiraling. The courts literally ripped my child from my arms and gave him to him temporarily where he had to move in with his mother and come down every other day for 8 hours and that only lasted  a few months. I went to rehab got better at the time and then when we both missed court it was dropped. I struggled his first few years and it was my biggest regret but I was still a good mother. I was still there, unless I was in jail or one of the terrible programs they forced me to do (which just made me worse and had me meet all new people that fed my addiction). Ive been here though CONSISTENTLY for the last 4 almost 5 years with a few ups and downs but now I'm on Methadone and have been for the last 3-4 years. I ran from court 5 years ago, because I knew what they were doing was making me worse, and that was the best decision I could have made. So I've had a warrant this whole time and I was unable to try and take him to court for custody and he used that against me more times then once. What he doesn't know is that the judge dropped that and closed my case since I haven't been in trouble this whole time and pretty much dropped all my friends, I talk to no one from back then and stopped even going to meetings because they were turning into a place of judgement and just for finding the next hook up. I dated maybe 3 people in the last 7-8 years, and after the last guy (I was with him off and on for 3 years and he was a bipolar manic manwhore that was not right for someone I could be a family with my son and I got pregnant with him and was on my death bed and had to end the pregnancy which crushed me and he questioned it being his and then made me feel so terrible about it, blamed me and told me I enabled him) I havent dated or thought of dating anyone since its been a year and half and all my focus is on my son and working, and taking care of my elderly [parents.My](https://parents.My) son is my world. The thought of losing him makes me sick to my stomach. Every time he comes home from his dads his behavior is terrible and he's so disrespectful to me.  He's an abusive piece of garbage to me and to my son. My son is petrified of him. I truly know and believe in my heart that he doesn't love him, nor does he want him, it's all a show. I don't think he's capable of loving anything because of all of his mental health issues and he's the purest form of a narcissist.  I've been so worried about taking him to court because of the last time when he got temp custody he got a free pro bono attorney that just fights for the dads and she was a beast mine couldn't even speak she just kept saying ok and looked like a deer caught in headlights and the judge was no better. I can't have him take him I won't survive. He doesn't care about what's best for him. He only wants control of me. I need advice on what to do. I'm worried that because I have a past and i'm an addict in recovery on methadone the judge will side with him even though he's the worst option, and will use my past against me. You really only have one chance  you can't fight again for custody. He brings him on playdates with these girls that he's sleeping with just because they have kids doesn't make it right. He doesn't care that he has a learning disability and needs to be at the right school. He went a month without seeing him but could go out and get drunk and laid every night. So the main issue is, we toured different schools my son loved this one (very expensive unfortunately but I would have made it work because I want the best for him) private school, very small classes, taught the right way, had coding classes and all this fun interactive stuff with only like 7 kids in his class. His dad turned it down right away even though I told him they weren't mandating masks. Then he said online so I found the best online school for how he learns and he went behind my back signing him up at literally the shittiest one possible because it worked with his moms schedule where there is one class 2 hours a week. HOW IS THAT GOOD FOR HIM after being behind due to covid? Last year his school was terrible and the teacher missed like 3 days a week every week and he blamed that on me, and he didn't help me ONCE with school.. The one day I brought him over there my son couldn't answer a question he asked and got smacked in the back of the head for it. The next time he went over to show him his oculus and I could hear him WITH MY CAR WINDOWS UP screaming shut the fuck up at him over and over and I ran up and slammed the door down to see my son on his lap crying because I don't think my son loves him either I think he's feared or scared into it because he's a child and doesn't know how else to handle those emotions. Yet I'm the bad guy because I'm an ""addict"" .. I enrolled him in this really good cyber school and I told him it starts on thursday and he's like no he starts school monday at pa cyber and I said no he starts on thursday he's been signed up for a month and he yelled at me for not telling him .. well he didn't tell me! Even though like I said he has had nothing to do with his schooling at all .. last year I couldn't even take him out of the shit school to put him somewhere good because he wanted his address used and that's why he's doing it now so he can try and get tax money for him and his gold digging goverment hungry mother can get something for him beign there. Then she preceeded to tell me that he already signed him up at the public school up there in a different county two hours away! I didn't tell him to move. He didn't even ask me if that was ok. Is that legal? I don't know what to do. We're still legally married neither of us have ""custody"" but none of the stuff he does seems legal to me. He has court coming up for lying on a gun transfer paper. He's getting a hand out with a good attorney for that too.He gets everything handed to him because he's a veteran. I wish I would have left when I was pregnant and put no one as the father on the birth certificate. My sons birthday is in two weeks he's not paying for the present, the cake, the party .. nothing .. just like he hasn't given me a dime in god knows how long but I'm a good person and always help him. The cherry on the top of the Sunday this waste of space actually claimed my son on his taxes even though he had him ALL of a month last year in total. I agreed because I'm dumb to file with him so he didn't have to pay taxes (I thought more money for my son) and he did that to hold me off from filing when he already filed .. when they then took thousands out for stuff he stole from the military and bills he hasn't paid so all he got back (and he lied saying he didn't get the check) was a thousand.. vs my 8k I was supposed to get back to go to my son.  The whole year while I was struggling he got to work on his credit and pay off all this stuff since he didn't have to pay for my son. So I had to mail my taxes in and i'm praying they'll accept them and make him pay every penny back and hopefully get in trouble for tax fraud. I hate him so much. Any advice would be much appreciated it .. like on if he can take him out of the county and enroll him in school without my permission, if he can just keep him and not give him back whenever he pleases, if there's a way for me to get a top attorney to almost guarantee that I get custody against this devil without really having much to pay up front being a single mom with no help but could pay payments, any advice on how I should go about doing that, and what are my odds on winning against someone like him a recovering addict vs a veteran. And any advice on what I should be keeping track of, what I can use in court against him etc. Mainly first I need to know if he can legally take him out of the county to enroll him for school without my permission so I have some sort of ammo to use against him. I'm completely lost. My son is not a pawn for him to use. If I lose him I will lose it, I won't survive he's my everything. He makes me a better human, and I would do absolutely anything for him. I want what's best for him, the best life, the best education, the best everything. He's just a chip to his dad, something to use to put me through hell and it makes me so sad that he has to deal with him at all. But, I know how society looks at addicts. He's Satan reincarnate and they look at him like this hard working dad, that served his country and dropped everything to care for his son, even though that's not how it went. Please help me I'm completely lost.",singlemoms,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/singlemoms/comments/pceliw/i_need_advice_bad_on_my_rights_as_a_mother_and/,,Scrivofilo89,pceliw,/r/singlemoms/comments/pceliw/i_need_advice_bad_on_my_rights_as_a_mother_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/singlemoms/comments/pceliw/i_need_advice_bad_on_my_rights_as_a_mother_and/,0,2021-08-27
A man named Jerry,"-A man named Jerry

When I was in middle school in 1985 I became good friends with a boy named Jerry. He had a crush on me, but I had a crush on his best friend. His best friend was also my first ‚Äúreal kiss‚Äù ever. We (the friend and I) dated like 2 months which is forever when you‚Äôre in middle school. Anyway Jerry and I were always good friends, he had a charming personality even at his tender age, was tall with baby blue eyes and longish blond hair. I just loved being around him, just always got such a good feeling from him and he had the most soothing and calming voice ever. Just one of those special kind of people, you know. We spent hours talking on the phone almost every night. 

In high school I can remember the exact spot in the hallway where Jerry told me he was dropping out of school. I tried talking him out of it, but it was no use. I was disappointed- not just because of him dropping out, but also because I would miss his presence. We kept in touch, but also drifted apart, then back, then drifted and so forth. We did that for many years. I did that with many friends as I‚Äôm sure most of us did and likely still do. 

When I was 15 I had runaway from home (for the first time). I hadn‚Äôt spoken to Jerry in awhile, but I called him a week or so in. He was concerned and wanted to help. Was so good to hear his voice. I ended up being caught 15 or so minutes later because a stranger overheard me on the payphone telling Jerry all about my runaway adventures and called the police who showed up while I was still on the phone with Jerry. The police took me to the police station where they called my dad to come get me. In the meantime Jerry had found someone to drive him to the police station so he could be there for me. I was not expecting him to do that. That is where Jerry met my dad for the first time. I was still in the back and Jerry had come, met my father, tried talking to him asking him to go easy on me. Brave. 

So in and out of each others lives we were for so many years. Again I find that to be normal with many friends whom i really love and am able to pick right up where we left off. But Jerry was extra special (and oh how all the ladies loved him). It was always so nice and felt soooo good to be talking with him again. That soothing voice, calm demeanor, but also fun, kinda a bad boy, so genuine and always down to earth and I always felt safe and cared for with him. 

Also during all those years, Jerry asked me out a lot. A lot lot lot. He always said to just give him a chance. I never gave him a chance though. Always had him stuck in the friend zone. I don‚Äôt really know why. But he was good with it, was always a perfect gentleman, never made a move on me and was always very respectful. 

I should mention that in middle school Jerry was in the junior firefighter program. Then became a volunteer firefighter with his father. I was disappointed when he dropped out of high school. He ended up working construction and partying too much. But always remained being a volunteer firefighter even through all that. Finally after some years, he got his act together, stopped partying, finished school and became a career firefighter. After serving many years on the line he is now the Chief Fire Marshal of our county. He‚Äôs 22 yrs in the fire service so far, not counting his volunteer years. 

All those years he was working on the line I always felt safer knowing that he was out there in our community, I always told people that if you‚Äôre ever in an accident that you would hope that Jerry is one of those that responds to the call because of his soothing voice and calming demeanor. Of course all firefighters are hero‚Äôs though. He just has an extra special way of helping calm people. 

Throughout the years Jerry married and divorced, I was taken, then single, he married and divorced again, I was engaged, we were both single at the same time, then we were both in relationships, just years of marriages, relationships etc between us. Any time he was single though he‚Äôd always asked me out. I always felt bad saying no, but he‚Äôd been in the friend zone so long now it would be awkward. 

I remember during his second divorce (he says the first one was not a real marriage, just young and married her because she was pregnant), during the second divorce (in 2014) he had called me very distraught in the middle of the night, it was a nasty divorce. I worried about him. We went to lunch not long after and he was much better and asked me out again. I politely declined. Awhile later he was the one getting a distraught phone call after my recent break up. I cried and cried on the phone with him. Listening to him he gave me a new perspective which helped me a lot and I got through it just fine. 

Awhile later I saw on Facebook that Jerry had a new girlfriend. For whatever reason I felt jealous over him for the first time ever. I mean I didn‚Äôt want to be with him in a romantic way, I think I was just jealous because she was getting his time and I knew I‚Äôd hear from him less again. I don‚Äôt know. Didn‚Äôt matter as I was involved with someone again as well. 

By early 2017 we were both single again. He asked me if I‚Äôd like to meet out for a friendly dinner and a drink at a local restaurant to catch up. Of course I agreed as I always loved being around him. I met him out, after our meal we moved over to the bar area of the restaurant where we ended up drinking way too much. 

It was getting late and the place was closing and neither of us had any business driving so we just moved our vehicles across the parking lot to the small field between the restaurant and the fire station and just sat in my car talking, listening to the radio and being silly. I was blabbering to him about 80‚Äôs music when suddenly without any warning Jerry started kissing me in mid-sentence. I was completely caught off guard because I never expected that from him. Then he said he‚Äôs been waiting over 30 years to do that and it was worth it and he was sort of apologizing. As he was talking I was processing about a 10 things, number one was WOW, did I just feel a spark for him?! Something in me stirred, I‚Äôve kissed many people in my life (even other ‚Äújust friends‚Äù) and what the hell is this feeling?! I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs and never felt quite like this. No way, I could never feel anything romantic for Jerry. Not Jerry! That would be awkward. But I was. And it wasn‚Äôt awkward at all. What the hell is happening? We stayed in the car making out for another two hours there in that field before going home.

The following days Jerry and I spent every free minute together and I was still in shock at my feelings. What the heck is happening? The feelings weren‚Äôt going away. They were growing. It wasn‚Äôt a fluke. Jerry was head over heels for me and I for him. He said he wanted to see me every day if I would allow it. We went on dates, he whispered every sweet nothing there is, he opened doors, he was perfect, it was like he just walked right out of a soap opera. I‚Äôm no dummy, I know these type of mushy feelings don‚Äôt last forever. I was waiting for a bomb to drop. But there wasn‚Äôt any bomb. 

Soon we made it official and became a part of every area of each others lives. Life was blissful. We already had several mutual friends, but then everyone else quickly loved Jerry too. He really is charming. He makes every person feel important. My dad is not so easy to impress and I think he sometimes liked him better than me. And he definitely likes him better than the first time he met him at the police station 30 years earlier. 

Seven months later Jerry took me back to the restaurant from the night we first kissed. He was acting very nervous. Said his stomach hurt. We parked and he walked around the car to my door, got down on one knee, told me all about how he‚Äôs loved me for 30 years, pulled out a ring and proposed. I was ecstatic and said yes. Yes he proposed right there in the parking lot of the restaurant. Not very romantic I know, but I didn‚Äôt care. He said his plan was to do it over dinner, but he was too nervous and thought he might throw up. 

We married 5 months later in March of 2018 - one year from the exact day that we first kissed. We had a small but beautiful wedding. We loved that our anniversary date would also be the anniversary of our first kiss. 

So here we are now only a few short years later. A lot has happened quickly since then. Shit always gets real eventually. He‚Äôs not the perfect person I thought he was for all of those years. And vise-versa. He snores, he is so stubborn, we have different tastes in movies, he‚Äôs turned kinda boring, he forgets some things that I‚Äôve said several times, he gets cranky. We argue sometimes. We get on each others nerves at times. But he‚Äôs still perfect for me. He‚Äôs never treated me with disrespect (well not intentionally)or even called me an ugly name. He‚Äôs loyal and hardworking. He‚Äôs noble and humble, smart, funny and not too messy. Everyday he still tells me he loves me.  He tells me often that everything he does is for me. He‚Äôs still so charming and his voice still soothes me. I can‚Äôt explain it. Sometimes I look at him and still see that middle school kid who I would have never fathomed I‚Äôd one day marry. My only regret is not giving him a chance much sooner. Wasted a lot of years that we could have been together, but hoping for many more to come still.",lovestories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lovestories/comments/pcekh7/a_man_named_jerry/,Story,Pineapplegirl810,pcekh7,/r/lovestories/comments/pcekh7/a_man_named_jerry/,https://www.reddit.com/r/lovestories/comments/pcekh7/a_man_named_jerry/,0,2021-08-27
(new folks please read) Played D2 on-off since around LoD launch; looking forward to D2R. Some long range thoughts.,"Before I begin, I just want to say: relax. D2R is going to be awesome, primarily because D2 is already awesome. If it happens to be a lot more awesome on PC than on console, then please, by all means, buy a PC. I'm not sure if you've heard, but D2 has been a PC game for a while. You can even run it on Linux if you want. It blows my fucking mind that I can play Diablo II with new graphics on Linux. It's even more inconceivable to think that we're on a precipice of new life for the online community of this game.

I've played D2 on and off over the years since about right when LoD was released. I never played vanilla D2. Don't remember what patch I started playing because I started playing single player at my best friend's house in middle school on the only ""smart"" device in his family's house -- the family desktop Windows PC. Probably a Dell or a fucking Gateway or something. It was a grand time, though we had to cram our time playing into bursts on weekends when we could get on the computer after his folks had gone to bed. Sometimes my friend's older brother played Diablo I, and it was cool to watch but I never felt inclined to play it.

Eventually the internet got decent enough that online D2 play was viable where we lived, and I got my own copy. After learning the ropes with a few garbage chars I finally buckled down and made a Meteorb sorc, which was awesome. I still love that combo. Later I realized fireball is way superior to meteor, but still, meteor is just fun, and as someone who used to play a lot of FPS games, I enjoyed increasing my timing skill with the meteor skill. It's quite difficult to use properly in some (many) situations. In other situations it's just unfairly powerful and massive and easy.

Kids on my school bus played, so we would talk builds (and talk shit, later on we played PvP), then would all log on immediately after getting in the house, and got some runs in before our parents got home from work.

I would typically play for about a year, then not for a few years, then play 6 months, etc. It's just one of those games that keeps its value and its draw over a very long period of time (obviously!). All the while the game was improving and changing, sometimes in small ways, and sometimes in massive ways. Go take a look at the patch history if you want to know how far this game has come.

In one of my later stints (starting from nothing, had lost my account cause Blizzard would clear out inactive accounts pretty aggressively), instead of starting with a sorc to make bread, I decided to take on a role as a fur trader -- I would hunt ubers, then trade the torch for keys, rinse and repeat until  eventually found two really godly torches that I was able to trade for some high runes and make some really fun builds, and some purely productive (and efficient) builds.

pnova + teeth pvp necro with full Trang's -- btw, check out the new full Trang's if you haven't yet !!

decked out low-level duellers (aka LLD, a great form of PvP) -- lvl 9 kick assassin was the best

hammerdin -- lame but still, nice to wreck Baal with ease

windy druid -- the new hurricane looks really good in D2R

and a few other weird ones that were fun but not worth mentioning.

There's no one thing that makes Diablo II great. It just checks so many boxes. The gameplay is simple, but very deep. The mechanics and stat and damage calculations are really wild. The basic principles are solid, and then the bugs and other idiosyncrasies actually add even more depth. Every aspect of every item is extremely important. A 40/15 jewel is worth how much more than a 39/15? I don't remember, but perfect items are just godly, amirite?

"[M4F] My Mom's best friend is my best friend, my sugar mommy, and my fuck buddy","I'm having lunch at your place before we have to head out later. You were washing dishes at the sink, your husband was at his office, and I'm facing towards you on the counter. You turn around with the water running. You put my finger to my lips and wink, pulling down your tank to pop your enormous MILF tits out. I can see several marks on your chest from what I did to you last night in my car.  
  
See, we've been fucking for months now. It wasn't easy raising a boy with a workaholic husband, you felt like you had to do it all on your own, and now that he's grown up and in college, you felt it was time to get some rewards back for all of this. You might be almost 40, but you don't look a day over 30. Genetics, right? Who would have guessed one of your first matches on Tinder would be with me? You swiped right more as a joke, but we started flirting back and forth and we found out the hard way that we - and our bodies - are very compatible. You didn‚Äôt have to offer to be my sugar mommy to keep me around, but you did anyway. It‚Äôs not like your husband even checks your bank accounts, who cares if you're funneling his money to your lover? Your son and your husband have no idea we've been fucking behind their backs. I've even introduced you to some of my other friends as my ""cougar older girlfriend"". You seemed annoyed, but not enough to not let me pipe you in your car before the drive home. The look on your face after I surprised creampie you the first time was hilarious, I guess it was even more surprising that you took the pill in anticipation.

"I'm in college, but things for my mom and siblings at home are fucked right now. My mom recently got out of the mental hospital and isn't doing too well, and my sister and brother are suffering the consequences of her being released too soon. (In my opinion it was too soon.)","I'm a college student living on campus, I'm 19F. I'm enjoying the experience of being in college so far. My roommate is awesome, I love my professors, I'm comfortable and somewhat familiar with the environment since I've been on campus since spring 2021, and I'm thrilled to be around everyone since it's an HBCU and I'm hoping it'll help me get a little more comfortable and intune with African American history and what it means to be a young black woman. However, things at home are not going well. My mom has experienced a lot of trauma in a rather short span of time. Someone broke her into her house and sexually assaulted her while she was sleeping, after moving to a new apartment she had to live with her verbally abusive asshole of a mother for several months, she lost her job, and then attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on her pain medications. 

The events I've mentioned are more major things, but there have been more incidents that have pushed her closer and closer to the edge. A few weeks ago she attempted suicide, and she would have died if my brother (aged 21) wasn't there to give her CPR until the ambulance arrived. After all the trauma she experienced in the past she developed extreme paranoia. She would feel like people were following her whenever she would walk or drive places, thought the neighbors were watching her and talking about her, and thought someone was out to get her. At one point she had removed the light bulbs from her ceiling fan and covered the lights and smoke detectors with cloth and tissue paper to make herself feel safer. Sometimes she would even sleep with a mask on because she thought she was being gassed through the air vents.

She got out of the hospital about a week ago and is back at home with my sister and brother. My grandmother recently got her own place and moved out. I thought it would calm her to be at home with my siblings in a familiar environment, but I might have been wrong. She gets suspicious whenever doors in the house are shut and still worries that she's being followed. My brother took her gun to try and make sure that she's wouldn't hurt herself, and she threatened to kick him out of the house when he refused to return it even after he looked after my little sister so much while she was gone or in a weird state of mind. Sometimes it scares me how different she sounds over the phone. Normally she has a friendly, strangely calming tone, but lately most of the time when I speak to her she sounds tired, hoarse, and empty, like she doesn't feel anything. 

My most recent concern is that my younger sister (13) isn't enrolled in school yet. Four or five days ago I offered to help and started filling out a form for her online, but stopped when she told me that mom had began. I had assumed that I didn't have to worry about it anymore at that point, but I learned earlier this evening that it still hasn't happened. My mom hasn't finished enrolling my sister yet because she simply doesn't want to wait on the phone or go through the process. She's always wanting to send my sister back to in person school since there isn't a waiting list and the process is easier, but the school already has confirmed cases of Covid-19 despite having only been open a few days at this point. This is another reason for my concern because the mom I know always took the safety and education of her children very seriously and wouldn't be so careless and lazy about all this. I don't know what to do because I'm in college, but I don't just wanna let things continue the way they are. My sister thankfully has a godmother of sorts who would be more than willing to house her and make sure she goes to school. She's practically an angel and a total blessing in these rough times, but I'm sure that if my sister were to contact her again it would end terribly, likely with CPS and my mom back in the hospital. And on top of that my mom would be alone if my sister went to her godmother. My brother has stated that the only reason he's stayed this long is because he wants my sister to have someone to look out for her, and if she went to her godmother, he would leave because he's so tired of everything. If he did my mom would be alone when she got out of the hospital and I'm almost completely sure she attempt to kill herself again. I don't know what I can do or what should be done.

To end this rant, I just want to say that I love my mom very much. The way I described everything might sound like I'm annoyed and don't care, but I'm very worried. Not a day goes by where I don't think about my mom and my siblings. My mom is the most important person in my life aside from my siblings and grandparents. I quit my job to stay with her over the holidays last year when she afraid of being left alone with my sister in her last apartment, I would try to calm her down whenever she had one of her episodes, and I would hug her and wipe her tears whenever she would cry or get upset. She means the world to me, I'm just not sure what I can/should do in such an awful situation when I'm no longer living with her. Any advice would be helpful, thank you for reading my depressing rant.",Advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pcdczn/im_in_college_but_things_for_my_mom_and_siblings/,,ThatOneHermit,pcdczn,/r/Advice/comments/pcdczn/im_in_college_but_things_for_my_mom_and_siblings/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pcdczn/im_in_college_but_things_for_my_mom_and_siblings/,0,2021-08-27
Review: The League of Seven by Alan Gratz,"I've said before that it is often true that good things come to those who wait. This is especially true in the case of audiobooks. So, today we're going to take a look at an alternate history audiobook that was more than worth the wait. We're taking a look at [The League of Seven by Alan Gratz](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-League-of-Seven-Audiobook/1705272363?qid=1630026813&amp;sr=1-1&amp;ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&amp;pf_rd_p=83218cca-c308-412f-bfcf-90198b687a2f&amp;pf_rd_r=JH85TR5CTPGN327EY1B3)

The League of Seven takes place in a world here Lovecraftian monstrosities, known as the Mangleborn, arose in 1775. The Mangleborn feed off of electricity, and will awaken when electricity is harnessed in sufficient quantities. The Americas were relatively unscathed, but they were cut-off from the Old World. The Thirteen Colonies founds themselves cold and hungry, but then salvation arrived. The Iroquois Confederacy agreed to adopt the colonists as the Yankee tribe, and thus, the United Nations of America was born. Over the years, the United Nations forged alliances with other tribes and expanded their territory, but mostly stayed east of the Mississippi River.

By the year 1875, the United Nations is a prosperous nation where whites and Native Americans live as equals, and is home to countless steam-powered marvels. Archie Dent is a young boy whose parents work for the Septemberist Society. They're an organization dedicated to the League of Seven. A group of seven heroes always form to take down the Mangleborn whenever they rise. Unfortunately, the Mangleborn have infiltrated Septemberist Headquarters. Before long, Archie is on the run with his trusty robot butler Mr. Rivets. They're soon joined by a Scottish boy named Fergus and a Seminole girl named Hachi. Archie and company have to find a way to take down the Mangleborn before it's too late. 

As you might know, before I started this blog, I got my start writing for the Alternate History Weekly Update. It was a truly great blog, and one of the places I looked to for inspiration when I started The Audiophile. It's a shame it had go, but that was a big motivation for me to really kick my own blog into gear. Anyway, one day Alan Gratz stopped by to talk about a new novel he would be publishing soon called The League of Seven. I loved the setting that combined steampunk tech and adventures as well as Native American cultures. Oh, and the maps, I loved the maps too. Personally, I'm a bit sad that an updated version of Alan's full color map, complete with little mini flags, wasn't used. I mean, I get that black and white is more economical, and the map in the book doesn't look bad. Still, that full color map is awesome.

They're mostly the same baring a few minor differences. The most noticeable is that, in the revised map, there is a former Japanese colony called Beikoku in the Pacific Northwest. Interestingly, the book makes mention of something called the Seattle Alliance, whose location is now occupied by Beikoku. Perhaps a holdover from an earlier draft of the book? Anyway, Alternate History Weekly Update founder Matt Mitrovich did a review of the book, which only made me want it more. Alas, there was no audiobook. I patiently waited for this to change, until one day, when my patience was rewarded. So, now here we are 

This book was exactly what I expected. I expected it to be an absolute blast, and it was. I loved the way it blended steampunk tech and alternate American History. In particular, I loved the focus on Native American peoples. You don't really see Native Americans too much in alternate history, or historical fiction for that matter. Actually, come to think of it, Native Americans also tend to get left out of the historical record in general; though recent scholarship is working to fix that. There's a lot of untapped potential in alternate history featuring Native Americans; particularly, in stories where Native Americans successfully resisted European colonialism, or else didn't get totally screwed over. As such, I'm glad to see that The League of Seven is working to fix that. 

At times I got the impression that Native Americans comprised the major of the United Nations of America; or at least, where in equal name to the white population. In fact, since 1775, some parts of America have gone from majority white to almost entirely Native American. For example, Atlanta, now known as Standing Peach Tree, is primarily populated by the Cherokee and Muskogee. I suppose it does makes sense, given that there haven't been any immigrants from Europe since 1775. The Southeast had a fairly large Native American population prior to the Trail of Tears, which never happened in the world of The League of Seven. 

New Jersey retained most of its colonial names, but is pretty entirely Iroquois as of 1875. They build their houses out of brick and stone, but in a way that evokes the longhouses of old. Wait a minute, what happened to the Lenape? They were the original inhabitants of New Jersey before white, and in this case Iroquois, settlers moved in. So, where did they go? It could be an oversight on Alan Gratz's part. On the other hand, at one point, Archie is going through his family's belongings and finds an aether pistol used in the Pawnee War. So, perhaps the expansion of the United Nations wasn't as peaceful as we're led to believe. We do see that there is growing tension between the Cherokee and Muskogee, though this is hinted to be caused, at least in part, by the Mangleborn. I thought that was actually good. Native Americans weren't a united block, they had tensions and rivalries just like everyone else. 

So, just what is this League of Seven? Well, like I said, they're a team of seven heroes that forms every time the Mangleborn awake. They're roster is a veritable who's-who of famous members from World Mythology and Folklore. The most famous iteration of the league is the Ancient League. They consisted of Daedalus, Heracles, Atalanta, Ma'at, Anansi, Wayland Smith, and with Theseus as the leader. Wayland Smith is the only one I don't recognize from mythology. Apparently, he was a Norse inventor who developed the aether pistol. Ma'at is the name for the Ancient Egyptian concept of balance and order, but there was also a goddess by that name, who acted as the personification of the concept. 

It would seem that, in the world of The League of Seven, all myths and legends are true, but not all myths are and accurate account of what actually happened. The stories from mythology we know are just the cover stories, because the truth was too terrifying for the general public to know. For example, Theseus didn't fight a Minotaur in a labyrinth. He actually fought a shape-shifting Mangleborn capable for producing powerful illusions. 

The Septemberist have identified a group who they believe to have the potential to be the new League of Seven. Well, maybe they did before the Mangleborn infiltrated headquarters. You know you're reading an alternate history novel when you've got Fredrick Douglas and Robert E. Lee on the same team. The novel makes a point of mentioning that Lee is wearing the blue uniform of the United Nations military. It appears that the United Nations had no equivalent of American Civil War. That raises a good question. Did slavery still happen, or did robots make it redundant? Mr. Rivets has been serving the Dent family since at least the 1770s, so the world has had steampunk tech since at least the 18th Century. We spend plenty of time in the South later in the book, but none of the people we see are black. Hopefully the sequels will address this. 

I love the little incidental bits of worldbuilding we get along the way. For example, lacrosse, rather than baseball or football, is the sport of choice in the United Nations. It makes sense, given that lacrosse was invented by the Iroquois. 

The alternate history of The League of Seven goes beyond the 18th Century. For example, the Roman Empire expanded into the New World and established colonies in North America. Atlanta, Georgia was the site of a Roman fort. However, these colonies were a major finical drain, and contributed to the downfall of the empire, along with barbarian invasions. Well, that's the cover story anyway. In reality, the real reason Rome fell was because they started building electrical power stations, and this attracted the Mangleborn. 

Also, New York City is instead named New Rome. Is it a former Roman colony perhaps? Instead of the Statue of Liberty, a statue of Hiawatha, the founder of the Iroquois Confederacy, stands in New Rome's harbor. Going back even further, Atlantis, Mu, and Lemuria were all real places that actually existed. Atlantis was located in North America, and the Atlanteans were the ancestors of the Native Americans. This is also why there's so many technologically advanced Native American tribes; the technology they use is derived from leftover Atlantean tech. Like the Romans, Atlantis met its end due to building electrical power station and awakening the Mangleborn. 

Okay, enough gushing about worldbuilding, let's talk about the characters. Archie wasn't a bad character, and overall, I did find him a good protagonist. That having been said, compared to cast of colorful characters featured through the book, he just came across as a bit bland by comparison. Of course, his primary job in this book was to introduce us to the world of The League of Seven. Perhaps he will get a bit more fleshed out in the sequels. There's more to discuss, but we'll save that for the spoilers section. 

Fergus was born in the Carolinas, but apprenticed with an Iroquois man in New Jersey. They both worked at Thomas Edison's lab in Menlo Park where they sought to unlock the secrets of electricity. However, as previously established, messing around with electricity is dangerous in the world of The League of Seven, and not just because you might shock yourself. Of course, Edison knows this perfectly well, given that he's working for the Mangleborn. Yeah, I didn't like that particular plot point, but more on it in a bit. As part of a ritual to summon Malacar Ahasherat, also known as the Swarm Queen, Edison has Fergus infused with blood from an electric squid. His body is covered in weird tattoos, but he gets the power to shoot electricity out of his hands. I guess it isn't impossible for Fergus to be Scottish, but I found it slightly odd, given that there haven't been any immigrants from Europe since 1775. 

Hachi is a Seminole girl from Florida. She lost pretty much her entire tribe to one of Edison's previous attempts to summon Malacar Ahasherat. Did she mean her specific branch of the Seminole? She must have, because we see other Seminole at various points. Anyway, because of this she tends to be fairly reserved and stoic, but she does open up as the book goes on. She has a menagerie of miniature clockwork animals that help defend her. We later learn that she attended an all-girls boarding school in Georgia. They covered all the subjects that young ladies ought to be proficient in. This includes, but is not limited to, reading, writing, arithmetic, sword fighting, archery, and hand-to-hand combat. I loved the scenes set at Hachi's old school. 

Okay, now let's switch gears and talk about some of the stuff I didn't like. As previously stated, Thomas Edison is a villain. Can't say I was too pleased about that, but then the book made it worse. At one point, Archie and the gang meet Nikola Tesla at an Atlantean power station beneath Niagara Falls. Tesla is presented as a noble hero working for the Septemberists. First of all, if there haven't be any immigrants since 1775, how his Tesla even there? Second, it really annoys me when people lionize Tesla. While it is true that he did some admirable work in electricity and radio, he also has quite a bit black marks against him. Chief among them is his support of eugenics. Tesla supported the forced sterilization of the mentally ill, criminals, and racial minorities. Quite ironic, given that Tesla suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder and hypochondria, meaning he'd be subject to the very policies he championed. 

And here's another bit of irony: Tesla briefly worked for Edison before striking out in his own. Thomas Edison gets an undeserved bad reputation. True, he was very strict with his patents, but that largely stemmed from how he got screwed over early in his career. True, he could be a jerk, especially later in life, but the energy market was a pretty cutthroat place. People like to blame Edison for Tesla never getting credit, but that fact remains that many of Tesla proposals, such as his plan to use massive Tesla coils to give free electricity to all of America, simply would not have worked. To be fair, not as much was known about the laws of physics as we know now. If anything, Tesla would have made a far more fitting villain. Say what you will about Edison, at least he didn't support eugenics or forced sterilization. 

Then there was a scene where Fergus meets a Cherokee police officer. The officer tells him an ""old Cherokee legend"" about how there are two wolves inside each of us. Slight problem, that's not a Cherokee legend. In reality, the whole ""two wolves inside you"" story was actually invented the American televangelist Billy Graham. In fact, in the first few tellings, he claimed it was an Eskimo legend from Canada. He only changed it to Cherokee after the Canadian Inuit successfully sued him for libel. Whenever someone tells you about a ""Native American"" legend or myth, ask them what tribe it came from. If they can't name the specific tribe, then it probably isn't authentic. Of course, as we've seen here, being able to name a tribe is no guarantee of authenticity. 

This is particularly frustrating as, up until that point, The League of Seven had done an excellent job depicting Native Americans. It didn't fall into lazy stereotypes or caricatures. This was also disappointing due to how infrequently Native Americans appear in alternate history, as I've previously mentioned. Granted, this was the only major error I could stop, and I certainly hope that future installments of the series won't make similar mistakes. 

I realize that electricity summoning the Mangleborn was necessary for the story to happen. I realize this, but it still gave the story an oddly anti-science, anti-technology, and anti-progress feel to it. Quite ironic, given the frequent emphasis on how cool the steampunk tech is. Moreover, steampunk tech is shown to have a few drawbacks. For example, Mr. Rivets has a variety of skills and functions, but can only activate them when the relevant punch card is inserted into him. Oh, and he can't insert the cards on his own, he needs a human to do that. If you want him to pilot an airship you need the airship pilot card, treating injuries requires the surgeon card, cooking requires the chef card, and so on. Technically, he can do functions other than whatever card is currently in him, but he does so slowly and inefficiently. And if you happen to lose the punch cards, well, tough luck. 

Okay, now we're getting into the spoilers. So, skip down a few paragraphs if you don't want any of that.

Last chance, you sure you want to continue? 

Well, okay, if everyone who wants out is gone, let's get into it. 

At one point, Archie and the gang go to the nation of Acadia, which is located in Quebec rather than the Maritime Provinces. I would think that Canada would be a more fitting name, but I digress. Anyway, they retrieve the fur coat of a Mi'kmaq cultural hero who was a member of a pervious iteration of the League of Seven. Think of the coat like the Nemean Lion skin Heracles wore. The Mi'kmaq hero was, according to legend, the son of a bear. In reality, however, he was a Manglespawn. Manglespawn are half-human and half-Mangleborn. Yeah, have fun with that mental image. Heracles was also a Manglespawn, rather than a demigod. 

I mention this because, at one point, Archie survives falling from 12,000 feet in the air. He was wearing the special coat, true, but that was still pretty impressive. It reminded me of that time Percy Jackson survived jumping off of the Gateway Arch and landing in the Mississippi River. Of course, that was because Percy is a demigod. It was then that the gears started turning. Archie thought of himself as the Theseus of the group, because he's the leader, but what if he's the Heracles? What if was not entirely humans? 

&gt;!Well, come the end of the book, my suspicions were confirmed. Archie isn't completely human, because he is indeed a Manglespawn. The Septemeberists found him on a mission to the Amazon rainforest. The Dents wanted children, but had trouble conceiving, so they agreed to adopt Archie. He isn't biologically their son, but they still love Archie very much!&lt;

&gt;!I mean, I saw that twist coming, but I was still a bit surprised. That's definitely going to play a big role in the future books in the series. Coming to terms with his nature is probably going to be a big part of Archie's character arc!&lt;

And you know I have to take a moment to talk about the audiobook. I initially wasn't sure if James Fouhey would be the right fit, but I soon found that I had nothing to worry about. He gave a solid performance, and from the looks for things, will continue to do so in the next audiobooks of the series. 

And I can't wait to explore those next books. Sure, The League of Seven had a few issues, but overall, I was extremely pleased with it. It was an absolute joy from start to finish, and I can't wait to explore more this steampunk alternate America. Do yourself a favor a get a copy of The League of Seven today. Believe me, you will be glad that you did.

The story of Joshua Gouthro.,"This is the story of Joshua Gouthro. He was white. He had a enormous grudge against the non-whites including niggers, spics, faggots and wops. He was constantly bullied in school for his racism. But his racism was so violent and weaponized that he would bury the bodies of dead black people and mutilate their bodies. He also would scream racial epithets in the middle of the lectures and would urinate all over the nigger faggots. He would also get police dogs to mutilate the corpses of dead black people. I want to make clear that there were absolutely no actual niggers or spics, faggots or wops or any other non-white that there was any contact with in his entire life. They were just warm clay in his prejudiced hands. He began looking on the internet for sites that would reinforce his racism. He found the Daily Stormer and Stormfront, among others. He absorbed himself in those hateful sites until he became a rabid racist himself. He posted pictures of himself on the Internet holding the severed heads of Chinese and black people. He became increasingly more violent. He also began searching for ways to make his racism more prominent. He decided he would build a castle out of corpses of black people. He assembled a small group of accomplices. But as project drew on, he needed more and faster accomplices. And he would threaten to kill the accomplices for not doing his bidding fast enough. Finally in the summer of 2017, he formed an alliance with another alt-right group. In 2018 they launched a race war in the small town of Salisbury, Maryland. On a Saturday morning, the alt-right men went shopping at Walmart together and hid out in the Salisbury woods. At about 11 AM when they took to the road, their vehicles became separated. One of them murdered two black men in the street, one an older man and the other was at his place of work. The other alt-right men went back to Walmart to change their clothes and purchase more ammunition and weapons. Joshua Gouthro was one of the other three white men. The other others were more openly racist. He was the smart one, the organizer, the man in the shadows, the clever one. When the local police entered the Walmart, they immediately recognized them and arrested them. During interrogations, they initially refused to reveal the names of their accomplices. The next day, they were released on bail and ordered not to leave their home county. However, the local police continued an investigation of the men‚Äôs best friends. Eventually it came down to three people: Joshua Gouthro, Jeffrey Winder, and James Brodick. The authorities locked them down and begin their investigation. But the three did not say a word. They remained silent and would not reveal the names of their accomplices. And also in furtherance of carrying on with their race war, they killed several more black people and mutilated their bodies. They did it in the most graphic and violent manner possible. They kept it covered in the news. But they made sure the bodies were easy to find. They used the tools of intelligence from alt-right propaganda to monitor the police. There was no doubt that the police were looking for them. But when the authorities or much of the public questioned why the alt-right men hadn‚Äôt talked or why they continued killing, the answer wasn‚Äôt from Joshua Gouthro, Jeffrey Winder, and James Brodick. Instead the alt-right issued a public relations statement subtly criticizing police. Police incompetence and lack of corroboration of stories by witnesses. ‚ÄúWhy do the police have to drag all these people in for questioning when all they were doing was minding their Godly business?‚Äù The New York Times underplayed it but they carried the statement in many of the newspapers. They didn‚Äôt get the endorsement of the Conservative Party, but the Times covered it as a news article. ‚ÄúMr. Peroutka's statement, which made no mention of the killings themselves, was viewed by political pundits as another strike against a troubled morality in American politics. Mr. Bush's re-election was promoted initially by the support of many conservative Christian voters. Mr. Bush himself has been attacked by Democrats and liberal commentators for his staunch supports of the death penalty, veto of a bill banning 'partial birth' abortions, and support of capital punishment. ...‚Äù The editorial went on to say, ‚ÄúAnd remember the so-called Christian right candidate, Joshua Gouthro, who was running against Congressman Wellington for his seat in the United States Senate. He was raising enormous amounts of money from Christians all over the country. Something obviously went horribly wrong with that campaign. Niggers then decided to murder him. Try not to use that language in polite company. Pass this book along to your wide. Our newspaper division will continue to investigate the alt-right.‚Äù You didn‚Äôt know it, but you did a lot of damage. You wrecked Joshua Gouthro‚Äôs life. He was found guilty immediately and sentenced to life without parole. The judge condemned him publicly as a vicious racist and convicted of premeditated murder. He was sentenced to life without parole. The other alt-right men were also sentenced to life without parole. There were also several life sentences given out. The three alt-right men were convicted on all counts and given the death penalty. But the outside pressures for harsher and harsher punishments continued. Some of the jurors were thinking about changing their verdict and felt that Mr. Gouthro‚Äôs sentence was overly harsh. They returned for a different sentencing. At the second trial, they were coerced into changing their minds and sentencing Joshua Gouthro to death by lethal injection. The judge commended them for their service. ‚ÄúMr. Gouthro, you have shown me your true colors. You are beyond redemption in this life. Your humanity has been extinguished. It‚Äôs my good fortune to sentence you to execution by lethal injection. Please step aside, Sheriff Johnson.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you have any questions for the jury?‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have two questions, your honor.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs Josh going to get the death needle when we get to the federal pen?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, you‚Äôre going to federal prison for a long time. Would you like for me to reread your verdict?‚Äù Joshua got deathly sick when he saw the black gloved hand of death coming towards him. Then came James Brodick swinging a deathly sicko smile. ‚ÄúSo, Mr. Gouthro, where and when are we going fishing?‚Äù That‚Äôs when Joshua Gouthro died. As Joshua‚Äôs corpus was vomited onto the gallows, a cool breeze of animosity blew in. Other handsome, young white men in white shrouds behind Mr. Peroutka glared at the niggers and spics, faggots and wops. This is just the beginning from the alt-right revenge. The alt-right revenge is just beginning. Chapter 16 It was a chilly morning on Monday, October 15, 2018 in Simon County, Mississippi. There was to be a solar eclipse that morning. There was a huge celebration planned for later that day. The venue was on the grounds of Gateway Elementary School in Gateway, Mississippi. It was to be a day for the federal government of Mississippi to show off to the people and to show how it could be useful to everyone. Like any big event of this kind, there were last minute preparations going on and everything was going as planned. One of the people in charge of this event was April Liles. She soon discovered that there was an error in one of the preparations. It was a placeholder in the spreadsheet of media. It was keyed and linked to the Excel spreadsheet. The placeholder was the name of Vivian Christopher, black reporter for the local newspaper. It was actually the entry of someone named Juan Santana, white reporter for the same newspaper. It was this error that related to the role of Vivian‚Äôs wife, Elsie Christopher. Elsie Christopher, worked for the IRS. She was a very vocal immigration protester and it didn‚Äôt matter to her that the taxes were not being paid. That was why she worked for the IRS. Elsie maybe was a federal employee but she constantly complained about the federal government. She was always angry. But April Liles cared little about her faults. Instead, she viewed Elsie more as someone who was looking out for herself first and foremost. Not saying anything about Vivian who was probably a homo. Elsie probably kept Vivian in a cage because she thought Vivian was a faggot. April Liles didn‚Äôt know why Elsie Christopher was the target. But she knew it was part of the plan. And the plan that was being broken was the plan to kill Mrs. Christopher. She really didn‚Äôt care at this point. But her superiors did and that made her very nervous. April made the call to the top: Ned Blakely. He would be in the area himself later in the day. He was using this event to give him cover for his big announcement. And the fact that he was in the area gave the impression that he would be around. ‚ÄúNed, I made some very serious mistakes. I have Vivian Christopher‚Äôs data here. It looks like there‚Äôs a placeholder here for a Juan Santana. I think I was supposed to kill Elsie Christopher. Something‚Äôs not right. This is bad, Ned. Bad! Oh, God.‚Äù ‚ÄúCalm down, calm down. You have been drinking too much. It‚Äôll be okay. Just give me a few minutes.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay, okay. This better not be my fault, Ned. Oh, God.‚Äù He hung up. ‚ÄúWhat is going on April? Why are you so upset? Did Elsie find out that I knew about your IRS scam?‚Äù April slowly approached him from behind. Kim looked at Elsie‚Äôs computer monitor dead center in her field of vision. It showed only a facsimile document which displayed the placeholder of data. She immediately detected it. She contemplated calling Boyd, but Boyd was in the far room. It wouldn‚Äôt take him long to get there though. All she needed to do was to send him an encrypted jump node. Boyd would come to her rescue. Maybe. Kim turned on her cell phone and clicked on the camera. Then she began taking pictures without anyone noticing. Her phone rang. Boyd answered his cell, ‚ÄúKim? Yo, you can get out now. She just came to work today. She didn‚Äôt chat anyone up on the way in. Is she online?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, she‚Äôs on the floor. Ned said she was going to a training over there in her office. She should have been back in her office by now.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay, go in the side door. Then go to your office in the IT arena. Make some excuse to go up there. Then get the mainframe computer. I‚Äôll meet you by your office at floor 13. You got that?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what we‚Äôll do. I‚Äôll call you in two minutes. After I call you, give yourself in.",confessions,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/pcdk36/the_story_of_joshua_gouthro/,,TheFormualCuamlivian,pcdk36,/r/confessions/comments/pcdk36/the_story_of_joshua_gouthro/,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/pcdk36/the_story_of_joshua_gouthro/,0,2021-08-27

The Dare end - JAKE Story,"11/8 

This morning I had training, that cage was pulling and stabbing me I had to pretend I hurt myself. As I couldn't play with it in and I kept day dreaming of Master. I have made a plan I'm going to talk to John's younger brother Frank, he loves the paranormal. Then I'm going to taking a detour to the O'Connell house. I'm finding that key and getting out.

Frank reckons that that house has been haunted for centuries. Apparently there was a confirmed bachelor (what ever trust means) that lived there, and he fell in love with one of his servants. Sound fucked up if you ask me, any way the locals found out because there was some suspicious activity at the house and rumors started that they were in league with the devil. So they did some pitch fork shit and hung them from the stairs in hall. I mean that's fucked up. Frank is adorable if not a little annoying he always wants to hang out with us, John hates it and keeps telling him to get his own friend. It must be hard for him he is only a year younger than us and he is nothing like John, Frank prefers books over sport. 

The house, I have been stood here looking at it for half an hour now... Right here I go...

It's 2am and I'm confused and I think I may be in love. I got into the house, I started to make my way to the stairs. Master was stood in the door to the right smiling and holding the key on a chain around his neck. Looking at him I felt at ease something I hadn't felt all day, it was nice, I looked closely at the key it had been engraved ""JAKE"" he had engraved my name on it. It made me feel important and wanted, I couldn't help but smile. Master smiled back and said "" I have had dinner prepeared, join me boy"" I responded to eagerly with a yes master. I walked to his side were he caressed my face, kissing me and pulling me close at the small of my back. I irrationally wanted him to hurt me.. Am I insane, he guides me into the room and pulls out the chair, like I'm a Prince. He serves me food I could only dream of at home, he sits and watches me rubbing my leg. 

When I finish he says I have another present for you, one I want you to also to ware outside this house. Just so I know your thinking of me. He puts a little blue box in front of me. I carefully open it and pull out a silver.. Butt plug with the words Master's slut boy, I look at him and say "" you want me to be caged and plugged?"" He returned a smile and said ""the cage can come off only in this house. The plug is for when you crave me but can't get to me"" what dose that mean asked all I got was a you will find out. 

He kissed me again and asked if I wanted to go upstairs with him, I did and I wanted him, he took me by the hand and lead me upstairs. I got to the top of the landing and the attic called to me again. I asked him ""Master what is in the attic"" he growled at me his face turning dark ""Never go to the attic boy, promise me YOU will never go"" I responded even before he finished ""No Master, I was just curious"" I had shrunk back ans was shaking. He grabs my face ""your curiosity will kill you""

He lead me the rest of the way and undressed me, unlocking my cage. He then let me undress him, I felt privileged and excited this time I was ready, and I craved his attention. We made love and he even played with my hard cock, edging me only to finally letting me exspoled while he was in me. After he had finished he picked me up taking me to the bath, I sat between his legs feeling safe. As we got out he re caged me, handing me my my cloths and present he told me it was time to go. 

Leaving the house I felt sad crossing on to the Street I couldn't help but to turn back, but nothing he wasn't to be seen. When I got home my step Dad questioned me asking me stupid questions. I'm sure he wants me and John to fuck each other so he can watch, he creeps me out more than that house. That house I don't know when I will get back as Paul my stupid step dad has grounded me for coming home late.",gaystories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystories/comments/pcfa7b/the_dare_end_jake_story/,Part 3,ActiveExternal1590,pcfa7b,/r/gaystories/comments/pcfa7b/the_dare_end_jake_story/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystories/comments/pcfa7b/the_dare_end_jake_story/,0,2021-08-27
23 [M4F] US West/Anywhere - A plethora of factors converged to remind me I've yet to experience intimacy.,"**To start off, you should know that I have a high-functioning form of Autism Spectrum Disorder, alongside Anxiety and Depression issues which compound it. I don't have a job and don't currently have plans to seek one, nor do I drive. There are several internalized barriers to those things which I am not presently seeking to attack. If that's going to be a sticking point for you, best to get it out of the way right away.**

Greetings lonely farers, I am prone to overthinking so let's try not over-editing as I go. I'm making this post because my desire to know what it's like to have an intimate relationship is finally overcoming my frequent second-guessing of myself. Appealing start, huh?

My story:

This pandemic has been hard on us all even if we didn't really recognize it at first. I didn't really mind being stuck at home for ages up until I finally got fully vaccinated and able to go out again. Many of my friendships and joys were already online after all. Once I did get to go out again, I was to experience a wonderful month or so where I got to go to my Local Game Store to play Magic: The Gathering in person with others, but it lasted only all too short a time. Soon enough the Delta variant cases started taking over the area and my worries about having Viral-Triggered Asthma as an additional factor to consider saw me making the decision to not risk being one of the growing number of people who have severe cases of the disease despite their vaccinations.

Following that decision I realized how much of an impact interacting with people as well has having a weekly routine including 2 days a week of actually leaving the house really had on me, and losing it was hitting me hard. Forgetting showers, letting my sleep schedule drift off the norm it had settled into, and the like. To top it off was a growing feeling of loneliness, present even when I was interacting my online friends. I came to realize that I wanted something more romantic than I felt I had any chance of happening upon in my current communities, so here I am.

Who am I looking for?

* A Woman near my age, I'm not sure I'd be on the same page with some one much older than me
* Caring and emotionally open like I am, emotionally available to listen when I need someone to talk to, and willing to give me time when I need time to myself. I would of course extend the same to you
* Appearance is not that big a deal for me especially given an online relationship, but if you're too large to move on your own, you're probably not right for me. I'm noticeably, but not morbidly, obese. I am trying to work on that when motivated enough and would support you doing the same if you're in a similar boat.
* Please be someone who is not hateful towards others but also unwilling to tolerate other spreading hate.

I'm not expecting to start off with Romance or Awkward Infatuation, because that feels way to unrealistic. I'm hoping to meet someone with which I share enough interests and potential interests to be able to be able to bond over them in Voice &amp; Text chat. What are those interests? well in no particular order:

* PC Gaming (Apex Legends, Path of Exile, (Heavily Modded) Minecraft, Indie games of various popularities (many Roguelikes, but plenty of others too)
* Magic: The Gathering (The OG Trading Card Game. My favorite formats are Draft and Commander, and I consider myself a Simic/Temur mage since before being so was to be on easy mode.)
* Music (Specifically the Metal subgenres of Symphonic Metal, Progressive Metal, and Power metal (generally everything that's carried more by 'clean' vocals than death metal growls/screamo.) I'm also open to broadening my horizons.)
* Learning new things (Especially cutting-edge science and futurism. And also random trivia-tier knowledge of dubious value (Value, not Veracity(Aka verifiably true but not life changing.))
* Reading (Science Fiction and Fantasy Novels, generally more contemporary authors than classics. However I have been slacking on that front and only really jump at reading when it's Brandon Sanderson.)

Those are the things I feel are core enough to my life that bothered to write them here.

I've probably rambled on long enough to scare off anyone who wouldn't appreciate my extensiveness, so I'll end off by saying I'd likely want to move off this platform but I'm open to responses in either Messages or Chat and I'd like to hear why you chose to respond to me.

How do you write out a player character from your campaign?,"I am going to apologize in advance because I am about to word vomit. Also DISMAS, LUX, GROB, GRANOLA! I know at least one of you has a reddit account so no peeking!

So I have been DMing for roughly a year, but it has been sporadic because my group tends to have scheduling difficulties. On player in particular. I need to go on record and say this player is NOT a problem player. He has been a wonderful player in the times we have met up on Discord. A good role player and he rolls with my humor. The problem is that he will be ready to be at sessions, but last minute emergencies and obligations from home life that are out of his control cause us to reschedule. It was never his fault, and while it was frustrating, I never blamed him. I am not going to go into details on that for the sake of privacy. At out last session a few months ago he said that he may not be able to play for the foreseeable future. At the time I said okay and we could restart when he was ready, thinking maybe it would be a month or so at most. I was wrong and am itching to play again. I realized DMing was one of the few creative outlets I had. So I spoke with this player and asked if he wanted to leave the campaign permanently or should I temporarily write him out to reinsert him whenever he has things more together. He went with the latter and that brings me here.

So fellow DMs and players alike, I have no idea how to write my player out. The way my campaign was structured, I deeply rooted everyone's backstories into the overarching plot so my friends would feel more engaged. I want to give a lot of detail so I can figure out where to go. So I am going to break up this explanation in terms of what has happened already and what I had planned.

&amp;#x200B;

**What Has Happened**

From when we last left off, this player was a Level 3 human Paladin, either Oathbreaker or Oath of Vengeance I don't remember. His name is Dismas Waver. At the beginning of the campaign set in modern world fantasy (think Dimension 20 Fantasy High), 17 year old Dismas was sentenced to indefinite stay at the Zepherfield Juvenile Hall while the courts figured out a more permanent punishment. Dismas was accused of vandalising all the scrolls and sacred scriptures and other religious paraphernalia in his home at the Temple of Tyr, god of justice. He was also accused of assaulting a crippling his mentor. However, Dismas is being framed by a priest of the temple who hates him for yada yada totally legitimate and not petty reasons (He basically thinks Dismas is the antichrist). Dismas knows this but he has no proof.

Some backstory on Dismas and the world. Dismas is actually the heir to the Waver family fortune and their company, Waver Spice Trade Co. His father is the CEO and his mother is a high society socialite, and his older sister, the business woman golden child. In this world, Tabaxis are the minority and there is a tendency to discriminate against them in both modern and rural parts of the world. Especially black tabaxis, who people think just bring misfortune wherever they go. The Waver Spice Trade has been rumoured to acquire its product through what ultimately amounts to slave labour.  The company is engaged in several illegal activities and white collar crimes across the business world. Spice mills and factories are rumoured to have horrible working environments, and severely overworking and underpaying the workers (especially the tabaxi!) Now this is all true, but the players and world media have no proof of it. Dismas growing up helped with the family business. They had a product called Waver's Spicy Favours that they sold in supermarkets, kinda like a hamburger helper except it could be eaten on its own too. They were immensely popular.  Dismas as a child was the spokesperson for Waver's Spicy Favours under the persona ""Spicy Boy Bobby"" (He was basically the Gerber Life baby of snack foods). Dismas had some ideas of his family's crimes, but ignored them and continued to help build the business. As he got older though, he saw how horrible they actually were and ran away. He eventually ended up at the Temple of Tyr and was taken in by his mentor, and eagle aaracockra called Reynault Baldwin. Reynault effectively became Dismas's foster dad and taught him to be a paladin. He remained there up until his arrest.

Fast forward to Juvie, Dismas has met other members of the party who have also been falsely arrested teenagers. Together they break out of juvie (destructively so. They may have set loose an Earth Elemental that I didn't know was going to be so powerful. That was a really funny session lol). In doing so, they run into the last member of their party, the psionic rogue. I mean that literally. Car driver failed the perception check, rogue failed the dex save, and he got run over (He lived). Anyway, this rogue is another teen that helps the police, and he's agreed to help the others clear their names as they go to snoop around the police station.

&amp;#x200B;

# DISMAS, GROB, GRANOLA, LUX! LAST CHANCE. TURN BACK

&amp;#x200B;

**What I had planned for Dismas**

A) Dismas is being haunted by a Mirror Nightmare that has taken the form of Spicy Boy Bobby. He has interacted with this creature once before, but only through voices. He doesn't know what this creature is or that it has taken Bobby's form. Mirror Nightmare are creatures born of lies, specifically about made up people. Bobby is a fictional character used to spread the propaganda of Waver Spice Trade and hide their dirt, and Dismas was always semi aware of this, implicating him in the lie. I got Mirror Nightmares from Dimension 20 again (Rom√¶nce Partner Baron from the Barones baby!)

B) Commercials for Waver's Spicy Favours are actually modified Charm Person/Suggestion spells. When you watch and fail the Wisdom Save, you get the urge to purchase a lot of Waver Spicy Favours the next time you see them. The party has actually seen this commercial already and the rogue failed the save, though no one is aware of the effects yet.

C) The God Tyr is generally an indifferent god choosing to observe and see how people interpret Justice, because it is a broad term. However, he has taken special interest in Dismas (who as far as I can tell has not tried to reach out to their god) and has been following him disguised as a mortal. For whatever reason he looks like the elf version of Keanu Reeves.

D) Dismas WAS the one who attacked his mentor. I was gonna place a red herring like maybe the Mirror Nightmare did it assuming Dismas's image. However, that does not make sense because Mirror Nightmares outside the Mirror Realm look like 1800s marionette dolls. Dismas was the one who attacked Reynault, but not of his own will. That priest from earlier used Dominate Person on Dismas to control him and Modify Memory so Dismas would not remember. So Dismas attacked Reynault while the Priest vanadlised everything. Reynault did not want to tell Dismas to protect him (also he was getting over his own shock) in fear of causing those memories to surface and traumatizing his son.

E) Dismas's Dad's crimes are extensive. One of which is he helps supply an underground Spell Scroll ring and black market. He is not the head honcho but plays a vital role. This underground ring is a part of the BBEG's plans, and while I would love to talk about it, it is a tangent to this post.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. Whew! Word vomit over. Sorry about all that. I don't know what if any of that is helpful at all. I need to find a way to be able to write Dismas out of the campaign temporarily so I can reinsert him whenever my player is ready to come back (I also should be prepared for the possibility of him never coming back though). So what does everyone think I should do?

34 [M4F] - [Michigan/Eastern US] Dominant man seeking submissive woman for a 1950s style TPE relationship [Audio included],"**I‚Äôve recorded an audio clip for you to enjoy. Find it in the copy of this ad pinned to the top of my profile. The ad there is updated but I can‚Äôt get it past the filter in this subreddit for some reason‚Ä¶ I would advise reading that copy instead.**

This ad is not for the women who want her man‚Äôs dominance to stop when they leave the bedroom. It‚Äôs not for feminists with a fantasy. It‚Äôs not for women who play submissive. **This ad is for women who are naturally submissive and find happiness in embracing traditional gender roles.** Someone who sees the male head-of-household dynamic as a natural fit for her temperament.

When I find her, we‚Äôre going to build something together. A relationship, a family, a legacy. 

**Our dynamic**

A partnership drawn along different lines from this notion of equality that drives many other relationships.

Her needs and wants and desires will be the most important driving force in my decision making.  She will never, ever doubt that I am acting in her best interest. She will trust in me and my ability to make good decisions and to respond proactively and with humility when I make mistakes. This submission I‚Äôm asking for is earned with respect, love and time. It won‚Äôt be expected overnight.

I don‚Äôt want to be a dictator. Nor do I want to be with some helpless, incapable woman who is a doormat by nature. I expect the woman who wants to get serious with me to want to follow my lead as the head of the family.

**My role in the relationship**

It‚Äôs a man‚Äôs job to provide and protect for his family, and my life has become oriented toward fulfilling that duty.

I have plans that will provide us comfort, security and freedom. That plan is already a decade underway and progressing more or less how I had envisioned.

""Providing"" means more than just material things, though. Providing her with love and support. Providing for her needs and desires. Providing her opportunity and freedom.

The protective aspect is equally important to me. This does mean physical safety, sure. When I find the woman who‚Äôs going to have my children, she is going to be very pleased that I carry a gun because I don‚Äôt outsource responsibility for my safety or the safety of my family, for example. It also means being a protective barrier between her and the world. Symbolic and chivalrous things like opening  doors for her, but also: taking the trash out, doing the hard physical work around the house, calling customer service and dealing with whatever headaches come up. Things like that. Being the man who keeps his eye on the horizon so she can tend to the home.

**Her role**

 * **She wants to be a homemaker.** She wants to spend her time raising our kids, tending to the home, cooking, homemaker projects etc. 

 * **She‚Äôs interested in spending a good amount of time together as a couple/family.** I‚Äôve been working from home for years and my goal is to retire by 45, so I WILL be around. Though I want us to both have our own lives and not fall into codependence, I do want to be with somebody who is on the same page about wanting to spend a lot of time together.

 * **She‚Äôs obedient.** As much fun as brats can be, I want somebody who responds positively to acts of domestic discipline. All subby girls can be bratty, I know this, but I generally want someone who wants to obey and deliver.

**Non-negotiables**

Consider everything that I‚Äôve written about here to be a starting point for a discussion about what our relationship could look like. I tried to paint a picture of a life I want to provide for someone special, but someone special is inevitably going to have ideas and desires of her own. We‚Äôre writing this story together, after all.

That being said, the following things are non-negotiable:

 * **You must want to have children.**  

 * **You must be willing to verify right away.** I‚Äôm being targeted by a catfish I busted at the moment.

* **You must be willing and eager to be a homemaker.** I don‚Äôt want our children to suffer because both of us have obligations outside of the home. My five year plan has me ready to retire you within two years, I‚Äôm working on acquiring us rental property at the moment. Please be willing to leave the workforce for good by the time kids come along.

* **If you‚Äôre allergic to cats, it won‚Äôt work out.** I‚Äôve got an 11 year old short-hair and he is SUCH A GOOD BOY.

 * **You must be 4:20 friendly.** Smoking doesn‚Äôt impair me (my therapist calls me an ‚Äúoutlier‚Äù), and it helps take my edge off and focuses me. I‚Äôm extremely tightly wound by nature, and this helps. My habit may not change soon or ever. I would rather be upfront about that.

 * The one that‚Äôs probably going to eliminate a lot of you. **No liberals.** I just can‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre interested in talking about things like ‚Äúintersectionality‚Äù and ‚Äúequity,‚Äù we are not going to see eye-to-eye. Independents, republicans and conservatives only please.

**Just daddy stuff**

I‚Äôm the ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù archetype for sure. I‚Äôm looking for someone to care for, but I‚Äôm not looking to be a caregiver.

I‚Äôve found the Dd/lg world to be filled with a lot of codependence and mental health issues and unresolved trauma. So I wanted to get into this angle of the relationship specifically. Being a ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù is the way that I love. The protector/provider. Soft and gentle and loving but also incredibly strict. 

I punish to teach lessons for you to learn from. I make rules and structure (if you need it) to better you and strengthen our relationship. I help you when you need it and give advice when you ask for it.

Much of the way that I show my love will be imbued with this paternal energy.

As such, Dd/lg play is something we can definitely discuss, but it‚Äôs not really an inherent part of being involved with me.

**About me**

I‚Äôm not one of the toxic masculinity guys, even if I have an extreme amount of disdain for soy boy liberal types.

I‚Äôm emotionally available and I‚Äôm very capable of vulnerability. I‚Äôve done a lot of work on my (lower-case t)rauma through reading and therapy and psychedelics.

 * **Career:** I‚Äôve been a full-time entrepreneur for four years at this point. I work in the business side of the adult entertainment industry. I‚Äôm currently working on the launch of a new business, taking what I do now and scaling it up to serve more people and make more money. I‚Äôm working a lot and have a ton of stress and obligations at the moment, but it‚Äôs a move that‚Äôs going to increase my upside earning potential significantly. **Quick note:** I do my business under a pseudonym to protect my privacy and have a SFW cover story for polite company. Google searches of me do not turn up results on my business and vice versa.

 * **What I‚Äôm doing in my life:** I just relocated to Michigan from my lifelong home of the Pacific Northwest. I‚Äôve always thought that I needed the experience of going somewhere I know nobody and establishing my own life there, and 2021 is the year I made that happen. My life currently is exploring my new home state, getting serious about cooking because the food where I‚Äôm at isn‚Äôt great, self-care and work basically.

 * **Physically:** I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù, with broad shoulders and a dadbod build. I shave my head and wear wayfarers. I wear size 14 shoes, I have big, strong hands to manhandle you with, and my cock is thick and veiny. I have a deep voice women love, and I‚Äôm told my lips are quite nice to kiss.

**Faith**

This is a tricky one for me because I‚Äôm still not sure how much I genuinely believe. That said, I connect with a lot of the ‚Äúhusbands submit to your wives‚Äù sort of Christianity and I do think there‚Äôs a ton of value to having Christian values integrated into our family when kids start happening.

All that said, I‚Äôm still a shameless sexual degenerate. So the reality here is: I‚Äôm going to be too Christian for some, and not Christian enough for others. If you‚Äôre in any doubt, let‚Äôs just talk it over.

**Sex**

I‚Äôm not looking to get into D/s right away. I‚Äôm looking to avoid curious tourists who are into D/s more than me or this relationship style specifically, so I‚Äôm going to want to develop some rapport and connection before the power dynamics get established.

My daddy side comes out in the bedroom, too.

I‚Äôm rough and strict but gentle and loving too.

**Limits:** The big one that I believe is most relevant here: The ""little"" thing doesn‚Äôt work out for me super well. In the bedroom, it can be fun. But if you‚Äôre the type who needs to go into little space and color and watch Disney movies, etc, this won‚Äôt be the right fit. Sorry!

**Kinks**

There‚Äôs a ton I‚Äôm into that I won‚Äôt bother to list out. Here are some relevant hot buttons. If you‚Äôre into something not on this list, I probably am too.

 * **Free use:** I‚Äôm the kind of guy who likes to take what he wants, and I love spontaneous sex. If you think I‚Äôm going to ask permission to use my own partner‚Äôs holes, I‚Äôve got a multi-level marketing scheme I‚Äôd like to tell you about ;)

 * **Orgasm control:** Edge play, denial, overstimulation. Using pleasure against you is a really sexy way to maintain control.

 * **Rough handling.** Not kink. Just my default setting. Spanking and hair pulling and throwing you around the bed and putting your body in the position I want you in. Slapping you across your pretty face if you‚Äôre really after my heart.

 * **Rules and discipline:** A feature in and out of the bedroom. When you commit to me, you accept my authority to issue punishments and you will submit when you misbehave.

 * **Teasing/denial:** And I am MERCILESS about it, too. I hope you like being wet and desperate and just **ACHING** for it, because that‚Äôs the life you‚Äôre signing up for if we connect.

 * **Exhibitionism:** Having a beautiful woman on my arm that all the men in the room desperately want to fuck is one of my favorite experiences. I want a woman who is confident in her looks and likes being my trophy.

**If you've made it this far, you should probably write me ;)**",dirtykikpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/pcffcy/34_m4f_michiganeastern_us_dominant_man_seeking/,M4F,conservativedaddy-,pcffcy,/r/dirtykikpals/comments/pcffcy/34_m4f_michiganeastern_us_dominant_man_seeking/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/pcffcy/34_m4f_michiganeastern_us_dominant_man_seeking/,0,2021-08-27

The Colons are sitting in a mansion, in suits, throwing money around. A beat comes in, are these guys about to rap? Is this a music video? 

Carly: ""We get in the ring, and smack up some fools/I spit in the face of the ones that ain't cool/And that's pretty much every one of these trios/They love losing as much as we love Puerto Rico!"" 

Orlando: ""Upper Echelon aren't up to the task/They lose all their matches and lose all their masks/And Culture Inc. just can't get a win/They get paid, show up, and then take the pin!"" 

Eddie: ""And don't get us started on D.C.E./We would hold their shoulders down for the 1, 2, 3/Megastars, your blood's running cold/'Cause y'all know that we're coming right for that gold!"" 

All: ""We win all the time, we don't do it alone/You just got put on notice by The Colons!"" 

That may not win Rap Song of the Year, but it certainly did make a statement: The Colons are looking to get those PAW Primetime Pyramid Belts!

Lukas Edwards becomes an American Citizen 

Lukas Edwards steps up to the podium where he prepares to do his oath. He's wearing a Maple Leaf Print jacket. Before he says the oath, he's asked if he has any questions. Lukas says, ""yeah, will I be able to keep my Canadian citizenship as well? I want to keep my options open."" The answer is yes, so Lukas proceeds with his oath, which he recites in a VERY sarcastic tone. Afterwards, he goes down to the floor, to mingle a bit, where he sees Jon Boston, with the Maple Leaf Provincial Title he took from Edwards. ""Boston, you here just to rub this in my face? That you beat me at Casino? Forced me to sign up for this citizenship?"" ""Well, that's not the only reason. On Action Hour, there's this video package that keeps on playing, following me around. It's been texted to me everyday by unknown numbers. There's a Maple Leaf on the screen for a couple of seconds during it, so I'm assuming that it's you."" ""Jonny, you really think I've got nothing better to do? Our rivalry is dormant, I've got my own stuff to focus on. Besides, I'm not much of a video maker anyways. Now if you excuse me, I've gotta go wave a stupid flag around for a photo op."" He tries to push past Jon, who stops him. ""Don't play dumb, Lukas. Instead, be brave for a minute, and face me on Action Hour next week."" ""Sure, why not make a little extra cash by beating your ass? I'll I'll it, if it's a tag match. Me and Winters against you and a partner of your choosing."" ""Alright, it's a date. See you next week."" Lukas walks by him, giving him a disrespectful shoulder bump.

Main Event Segment 9-
Mark Davis vs. D. Stone 

A. These two groups have been warring for weeks, so this could be very explosive. Out comes Mark Davis of Aussie Open, accompanied by Kyle Fletcher, Mike Bailey, and Lazarus Strong. They've formed an Alliance to combat the rise of The Chapter, but will they succeed? 

B. Here comes the tallest man in PAW, an inch taller than Lazarus, D. Stone. He's accompanied by the Tag Team Champions, Dhinsa and Selmani, his manager, Paul Ellering, Jake Crist, and their leader, the PAW World Champ, Erick Redbeard. Nobody knows what the D in his name stands for, but our best guess is Doom or Death, because that's what he brings to the table. 

C. The bell rings, and there's a face-off. Mark Davis is a hoss, but he's still dwarfed by D. Stone. There's no lock-up here, as they both go for shoulder tackles. Unsurprisingly, Stone gets the better of it, but Mark stays on his feet, and starts throwing teeps to Stone's shins and knees. They actually seem to buckle him a bit, perhaps the experience edge will help Davis tonight. Stone starts swinging, and Mark avoids most of the strikes, but one of them grazes his temple, and it's enough to sit him down. Stone laughs at him, and Mark gets up frustrated, and uses all of his strength to pick Stone up, slam him, and start dropping rights and lefts! Stone was completely unprepared, and Stone is taking advantage, it seems like he has the behemoth in a bad way now, and Davis quickly goes to the middle rope and hits a Leg Drop, before going for a pin. 1, kickout! This match is nowhere near over. Mark reaches down to pick Stone up, but the giant reaches up and grabs Mark by the throat! He climbs to his feet and lands a Chokeslam into a choke cover! 1, and Davis kicks out! Both of these guys have a lot left in the tank. Stone hits a Splash, and then another. 1, 2, kickout again! Now, Stone goes for a third one, but this time from up high! A man this size? He goes for the splash, but Davis rolls out of the way, allowing Stone to crash into the mat! Mark immediately locks in an STF! Stone is struggling here, he's not used to this kind of grappling! He slowly inches towards the ropes, and Davis tries to drag him back but The Chapter's enforcer is simply too powerful, and he clutches the bottom rope for dear life. Davis lets go, and both men are tired. Although this match hasn't gone very long, it's been very physical. They get to their feet, and trade uppercuts. Stone lands 3 in a row, and seems primed to take Davis out, but Mark unleashes a bomb that sends Stone crashing down! He bounces off the ropes, and Selmani grabs his leg, prompting The Alliance to attack him, and now Dhinsa and Crist are involved too! They brawl into the ring, and now the referee has to separate them. But he doesn't notice Erick Redbeard slipping in and planting Mark with the Full Nelson Slam! Stone gets up, picks up his opponent, and cracks him with the Death Boot! Cover! 1, 2, 3! D. Stone gets a win with the help of his faction! 

D. Both groups start brawling, and this is even more violent than last time! Chairs are being thrown, ring ropes are being ripped off, and The Chapter is getting the upper hand because they have an extra man. But somebody's coming out to even the odds! It's the man that was victimized by The Chapter at Trouble in Texas, Nick Gage! We haven't seen him since, and he goes straight after Erick Redbeard, peppering him with lefts and rights! Now it's a fair fight! Or is it? Somebody just snuck into the ring in a black mask, and they're on The Chapter's side! They choke out Kyle Fletcher? Who could this be? They take off the mask...it's MEGAN LOVE!!! Megan Love has aligned herself with The Chapter, this is insane! As The Chapter pose in the ring, Orestes Jaimes comes out. ""Look, this is enough. You guys have been fighting too much. Now we've got Nick Gage in the mix? And Megan Love? I'm not going to let my company fall into anarchy. Next week, you guys are going to sit in the ring, separated by police, and work things out. Whether it's a reconciliation, or a match agreement, or whatever, I don't care, as long as this madness stops. See you all next week."" This has been insane, Nick Gage fighting for The Alliance, and Megan Love sinking deeper into her turn against the fans? How can The Alliance respond to this? Will we find out next week?",fantasybooking,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybooking/comments/pceek9/paw_action_hour_episode_27/,,rickyS71,pceek9,/r/fantasybooking/comments/pceek9/paw_action_hour_episode_27/,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybooking/comments/pceek9/paw_action_hour_episode_27/,0,2021-08-27
M4F- Reigniting the flame,"Even after all these years, your husband could never know you like I knew you. It started as a simple cliche, I was your brother‚Äôs best friend and by proxy that made you my little sister with how much I was over at your family‚Äôs house. It wasn‚Äôt until I was in my senior year of college that I ever noticed you growing up. It was the summer of graduation and you had just turned 18, I had returned home which meant I was always hanging out with your brother and reliving old times; not to mention swinging by my ‚Äòlittle sister‚Äô graduation party. You knew what I was thinking from the moment I laid eyes on you, not that either of us were ever good at hiding our poker faces. All it took was some privacy before the animal urges kicked it. It started out with furiously making out in the bathroom and ended with me sneaking out of your bedroom window the following morning after taking your virginity.

That was the start of our secret, that summer we hooked up as much as we could and in as many spots that almost got us caught. It wasn‚Äôt that it would be an ordeal if we were caught, but we had agreed on ‚Äòfun‚Äô and we were going to have as much of it without getting too serious. We parted that summer, both of us knowing that we were going to opposite sides of the country as I started grad school and you began your college adventure. 

It was almost 3 years later before we saw each other again, this time at your brother‚Äôs wedding. You were sitting out behind a bar with some friends when I arrived with your brother‚Äôs bachelor party. Old habits die hard and my eyes couldn‚Äôt leave the sight of your curvier body if they were plucked from my head. It didn‚Äôt take long for us to start coming up with excuses. I made short work of getting everyone in my group drunk with shots and beers before sneaking away to take you in a bathroom stall. It was the closest we ever came to getting caught as your brother came in as you were riding me on the toilet.

Sadly that was our last night together, but there were things we knew about each other‚Äôs bodies that any partner would never discover. It was a primal connection that the two of us shared and no matter the time apart, the second we see each other the flame burns bright again. It wasn‚Äôt until you were married that we even bumped into each other again. You had married David almost three years ago, at 26. We had lost contact as life got in the way, we might see a post on each other‚Äôs social media and give it a like but it was hard to do more than that‚Ä¶ especially after I skipped out on attending your wedding.

Now at 29 a panic started to set in mentally for you. You married David, thinking he was safe and you wouldn‚Äôt have the frantic relationship that I provided where the only time we talked was on our way to have sex or basking in our passion afterwards. The one thing you soon realized is, safe is boring. Safe doesn‚Äôt drag you into public bathrooms or pulls over while driving to take you in the back seat. Safe is working hard and working overtime for three years and with no children or passion in the marriage. Safe was driving you crazy, which you thought you were when you saw my post online about moving to the same you live in. 

I was going to be close again and you could feel the flames of our passion fan themselves in the pit of your stomach. Yearning to have a baby and aching to feel me inside you again you set to work to get my attention‚Ä¶ Not that it was hard with the message you sent to my DM‚Äôs. A picture you posing lingerie that you bought, wanting to be as sexy for your husband, with just two words.

The Dare end - JAKE story,"11/8 

This morning I had training, that cage was pulling and stabbing me I had to pretend I hurt myself. As I couldn't play with it in and I kept day dreaming of Master. I have made a plan I'm going to talk to John's younger brother Frank, he loves the paranormal. Then I'm going to taking a detour to the O'Connell house. I'm finding that key and getting out.

Frank reckons that that house has been haunted for centuries. Apparently there was a confirmed bachelor (what ever trust means) that lived there, and he fell in love with one of his servants. Sound fucked up if you ask me, any way the locals found out because there was some suspicious activity at the house and rumors started that they were in league with the devil. So they did some pitch fork shit and hung them from the stairs in hall. I mean that's fucked up. Frank is adorable if not a little annoying he always wants to hang out with us, John hates it and keeps telling him to get his own friend. It must be hard for him he is only a year younger than us and he is nothing like John, Frank prefers books over sport. 

The house, I have been stood here looking at it for half an hour now... Right here I go...

It's 2am and I'm confused and I think I may be in love. I got into the house, I started to make my way to the stairs. Master was stood in the door to the right smiling and holding the key on a chain around his neck. Looking at him I felt at ease something I hadn't felt all day, it was nice, I looked closely at the key it had been engraved ""JAKE"" he had engraved my name on it. It made me feel important and wanted, I couldn't help but smile. Master smiled back and said "" I have had dinner prepeared, join me boy"" I responded to eagerly with a yes master. I walked to his side were he caressed my face, kissing me and pulling me close at the small of my back. I irrationally wanted him to hurt me.. Am I insane, he guides me into the room and pulls out the chair, like I'm a Prince. He serves me food I could only dream of at home, he sits and watches me rubbing my leg. 

When I finish he says I have another present for you, one I want you to also to ware outside this house. Just so I know your thinking of me. He puts a little blue box in front of me. I carefully open it and pull out a silver.. Butt plug with the words Master's slut boy, I look at him and say "" you want me to be caged and plugged?"" He returned a smile and said ""the cage can come off only in this house. The plug is for when you crave me but can't get to me"" what dose that mean  asked all I got was a you will find out. 

He kissed me again and asked if I wanted to go upstairs with him, I did and I wanted him, he took me by the hand and lead me upstairs. I got to the top of the landing and the attic called to me again. I asked him ""Master what is in the attic"" he growled at me his face turning dark ""Never go to the attic boy, promise me YOU will never go"" I responded even before he finished ""No Master, I was just curious"" I had shrunk back ans was shaking. He grabs my face ""your curiosity will kill you""

He lead me the rest of the way and undressed me, unlocking my cage. He then let me undress him, I felt privileged and excited this time I was ready, and I craved his attention. We made love and he even played with my hard cock, edging me only to finally letting me exspoled while he was in me. After he had finished he picked me up taking me to the bath, I sat between his legs feeling safe. As we got out he re caged me, handing me my my cloths and present he told me it was time to go. 

Leaving the house I felt sad crossing on to the Street I couldn't help but to turn back, but nothing he wasn't to be seen. When I got home my step Dad questioned me asking me stupid questions. I'm sure he wants me and John to fuck each other so he can watch, he creeps me out more than that house. That house I don't know when I will get back as Paul my stupid step dad has grounded me for coming home late.",gaystory,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystory/comments/pcf7tn/the_dare_end_jake_story/,,ActiveExternal1590,pcf7tn,/r/gaystory/comments/pcf7tn/the_dare_end_jake_story/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaystory/comments/pcf7tn/the_dare_end_jake_story/,0,2021-08-27

Guide: 3 Veteran Methods To Save You In The Wilderness," There are many different things that can go wrong on a day trip into the wilderness, but the most common are:

‚Ä¢ Getting lost ‚Ä¢ Weather changing rapidly ‚Ä¢ Falling into water, especially just before sundown, and getting hypothermia ‚Ä¢ Injury ‚Ä¢ Getting shot by a stray bullet (especially during hunting season)

Any of these situations, and more, can turn a simple day‚Äôs hunting  into a fight for your very survival. And don‚Äôt try to tell yourself that  they can‚Äôt happen to you‚Ä¶ they can. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

## Always Carry

The Boy Scouts have always had it right: ‚ÄúBe prepared.‚Äù

I leaned that as a young scout and it has stuck with me all my life. I  don‚Äôt care what situation any of us find ourselves going into, we  should always go prepared. I have a concealed carry permit for that very  reason. But I don‚Äôt stop myself at carrying a gun, expecting that to  solve all life‚Äôs problems. Guns are useful tools for certain situations,  but there are other tools which are just as valuable to carry.

When venturing into the wilderness, this means carrying the necessary  tools to survive. We have to assume that we‚Äôre going to be in the  woods, or whatever wilderness situation, much longer than we expect to.  Something can always go wrong, as I mentioned in that short list above.

Okay, let‚Äôs get a bit more specific about that. What exactly should  we carry with us, if we‚Äôre going into the wilderness for a day‚Äôs  hunting?

* Survival kit (I‚Äôll get into more detail in a moment)
* Canteen or camelback filled with water
* Good, sharp hunting knife
* Solar charger for your phone
* Rain poncho (even if there‚Äôs no forecast for rain)
* First-aid kit (military IFAK is ideal)

&amp;#x200B;

## Survival Kit

How big a survival kit you carry is up to you, but I‚Äôd  recommend going for something a bit better than one that you can fit  into an Altoids tin.

Any survival kit needs to meet your basic survival requirements. That means it has to provide you with:

* A means of building shelter
* A means of purifying water
* Fire starters and accelerants
* Some high-energy food
* Personal medications you take for chronic health conditions
* Compass
* Topographical map of the area you‚Äôre going to be in (few bother with this, even if they carry a compass)
* Tactical flashlight with extra batteries
* Honing stone for your knife
* TP or Kleenex to use in its place (maybe not a survival item, but useful nevertheless)
* Money ‚Äì just in case

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

## Learn the Skills

But it‚Äôs not really enough to carry along the right gear, unless you have the knowledge to go with it.

You can give the world‚Äôs best survival kit to a five-year-old and  they won‚Äôt survive, because they don‚Äôt know what to do with it. Sadly,  there are adults around, especially living in the city, who don‚Äôt have  much more of an idea, than that five-year-old. Learning basic survival  skills really isn‚Äôt all that hard, and can even be fun. After all,  that‚Äôs what most of us did, if we were in Boy Scouts. The same bushcraft  skills that we learned back in the Scouts, are the same skills needed  to survive.

Even so, let me add this; assume that you‚Äôre going to be dealing with  bad weather. It‚Äôs a lot harder to survive when it‚Äôs raining, than it is  when the weather is good. Rain makes it harder to stay dry, build  shelter and start a fire; all three of which are necessary to avoid  hypothermia.

&amp;#x200B;

## A Little Planning Helps

We‚Äôve already talked about making sure that you have survival gear  and a first-aid kit with you with you; but that‚Äôs not all you need to  do, in order to prepare for your trip. Remember, we‚Äôre operating under  the assumption that something is likely to go wrong; therefore, there  are other things you should do.

I mentioned earlier that it‚Äôs a good idea to have a topographical map  with you. You can download these for free from the USGS website.  Laminate it or at least put it in a plastic sleeve, to protect it from  getting wet. Even if you know the terrain well or there aren‚Äôt readily  identifiable terrain features you can use to find your way, a  topographical map can provide you with one of the most important pieces  of information you need to have, in order to survive ‚Äì where to find  water.

The other major thing you need to do is to tell someone where you are  going and when you expect to be back. This is a very important part of  any potential rescue operation. While game wardens and park rangers look  for abandoned vehicles and other signs that someone might be lost in  the woods, the fastest way for any rescue operation to be initiated is  through a call, when someone doesn‚Äôt return back home when they were  supposed to.

So the person that you use as your point of contact not only needs to  know where you are going and when you‚Äôre coming back; but also knows to  call for help, if you don‚Äôt come back when you‚Äôre supposed to. That‚Äôs  the key; as rescue workers take those calls seriously.

Of course, that means that you will have to keep in touch with that  person, letting them know if your plans change or something delays you  from returning. But with everyone having cell phones today, that  shouldn‚Äôt be much of a problem. All it takes is a little coordination  between you and them.

Can you help me out,"I don't know what my dream means, It was scary as hell. I believe this subreddit is the right place to go because there are alot of people here who are familiar with the meaning of dreams. 

This part of the dream is where I could safely say that it is a nightmare. It all started with me entering a room in the second floor of a farm house. in this part there was supprising some dialogue in it, it was a man talking in the background saying something like ""There was a boy named Tim, he was stolen and never came back."" 

Then I was standing in a lit bedroom, outside was pitch black, two windows in the bedroom indicating this.¬†¬†¬† 
The bedrom had furnachure like a bed in the corner out of the way, about 5 feet away from the closest window a table was close by however. 

It had a white patterned table cloth on it, kinda like what a grandmother would have in their home. ontop jad a box that was already was open, inside were an assortment of knives, chissles and blades for carpentry and other hobby purposes. It was a close reach from the window. 

I was not alome, In the other side of the room feom where i was standing, there was a man, about the same age as me. He looked normal, turned out to be normal throughout the dream. Me and the other guy were having a conversation, not one that was reconosable at all, bit in the moment felt normal. 

Suddenly I feel a rope pulling from my waste, I realise that the rope was wrapping around me throughout the whole encounter of me being oblivious of the most inportant part of my suroundings. The origin of the ropes location is unknown until i look at the window, it was just pitch black. the white threaded cable is gradually pulling harder and harder. when it pulled me close to the window, I could finally see where its coming from but at the sametime, the origin is unknown. 

I see that I am on a 2 story house. Looking down I see that its not just pitch black, there is a light in the middle of the yard eluminating the green grass around it, also glowing the walls that make up the home from the outside. the pale rope is coming from beond the light, beond my knowledge. I begin to panic and scream and push away from the window, but it brings me back in harder. 

In the back of my mind ""and never came back,"" filled me with fear, knowing my fate, but something subcontiously told me about the knive box. I barely reached over and got myself a leatherwork crafting knife. 

It was small but I knew what to do with it, i looked over to the pale rope and stabbed it, only cutting half. 

By this time the man in the other side of the room was freaking the f*ck out. just panicking and saying ""oh my god"" over and over again. I took the courage to take another swing with the knife and cut the rope, it craweled out of the window like a whip and left. 

I ran over to the other window and looked at the other side of the scene. there were cows and goats wondering around randomly, no self derection merging and dissapearing from the light. I see the rope pull away through the grass. 

but the whole time after the rope was cut, I feel an extremely uneasy feeling as I was being watched with sinister intent, like I didn't fill my purpose, I didn't get pulled away like I was destined to, I needed to die. I could only hear the insects of the night, glancing out the window once more, I know something is out beond the darkness, I knew they were evil but I never seen them. But i still felt the dread and the feeling that someone was watching at me. 


Then I wake up with an uneasy feeling.

The Dare end - JAKE Story,"11/8 

This morning I had training, that cage was pulling and stabbing me I had to pretend I hurt myself. As I couldn't play with it in and I kept day dreaming of Master. I have made a plan I'm going to talk to John's younger brother Frank, he loves the paranormal. Then I'm going to taking a detour to the O'Connell house. I'm finding that key and getting out.

Frank reckons that that house has been haunted for centuries. Apparently there was a confirmed bachelor (what ever trust means) that lived there, and he fell in love with one of his servants. Sound fucked up if you ask me, any way the locals found out because there was some suspicious activity at the house and rumors started that they were in league with the devil. So they did some pitch fork shit and hung them from the stairs in hall. I mean that's fucked up. Frank is adorable if not a little annoying he always wants to hang out with us, John hates it and keeps telling him to get his own friend. It must be hard for him he is only a year younger than us and he is nothing like John, Frank prefers books over sport. 

The house, I have been stood here looking at it for half an hour now... Right here I go...

It's 2am and I'm confused and I think I may be in love. I got into the house, I started to make my way to the stairs. Master was stood in the door to the right smiling and holding the key on a chain around his neck. Looking at him I felt at ease something I hadn't felt all day, it was nice, I looked closely at the key it had been engraved ""JAKE"" he had engraved my name on it. It made me feel important and wanted, I couldn't help but smile. Master smiled back and said "" I have had dinner prepeared, join me boy"" I responded to eagerly with a yes master. I walked to his side were he caressed my face, kissing me and pulling me close at the small of my back. I irrationally wanted him to hurt me.. Am I insane, he guides me into the room and pulls out the chair, like I'm a Prince. He serves me food I could only dream of at home, he sits and watches me rubbing my leg. 

When I finish he says I have another present for you, one I want you to also to ware outside this house. Just so I know your thinking of me. He puts a little blue box in front of me. I carefully open it and pull out a silver.. Butt plug with the words Master's slut boy, I look at him and say "" you want me to be caged and plugged?"" He returned a smile and said ""the cage can come off only in this house. The plug is for when you crave me but can't get to me"" what dose that mean asked all I got was a you will find out. 

He kissed me again and asked if I wanted to go upstairs with him, I did and I wanted him, he took me by the hand and lead me upstairs. I got to the top of the landing and the attic called to me again. I asked him ""Master what is in the attic"" he growled at me his face turning dark ""Never go to the attic boy, promise me YOU will never go"" I responded even before he finished ""No Master, I was just curious"" I had shrunk back ans was shaking. He grabs my face ""your curiosity will kill you""

He lead me the rest of the way and undressed me, unlocking my cage. He then let me undress him, I felt privileged and excited this time I was ready, and I craved his attention. We made love and he even played with my hard cock, edging me only to finally letting me exspoled while he was in me. After he had finished he picked me up taking me to the bath, I sat between his legs feeling safe. As we got out he re caged me, handing me my my cloths and present he told me it was time to go. 

Leaving the house I felt sad crossing on to the Street I couldn't help but to turn back, but nothing he wasn't to be seen. When I got home my step Dad questioned me asking me stupid questions.

Mother spends money on her cat then tells me she hasn‚Äôt enough money for my birthday dinner,"There are two people involved in this story:
My mother as my mother
Me as I 

Throughout my life I‚Äôve consistently felt like I‚Äôve had to mother my own mother. Even when I was little she treated me as a confidant with issues that confused me and brought me stress. Recently she‚Äôs been free of alcohol about 6 months (yay!) and talks a lot about thanking the creator and listening to your soul and this type of thing. 
Anyways, my birthday was coming up and she tells me to pick somewhere and she will take me out to dinner. I picked a moderate place, nothing too expensive. A few days before my birthday dinner she calls and says she can‚Äôt treat me because she has no money. I tell her that‚Äôs fine, let‚Äôs still go, I don‚Äôt need anything. And in my mind I really don‚Äôt NEED her to treat me if she‚Äôs broke. The thing is though, In that same call she goes in to tell me how she just did a silent auction and bought a bunch of stuff for her cat as well as 20 dollar scratch off lottery tickets. Then over the next week send me a stream of snapshots of her Amazon purchases for her home office. Things like half moon wall mirrors and little macrame plant baskets. 
Anyways, it seems she did have money, just not for me. I‚Äôm feeling really hurt and I don‚Äôt know how to bring it up to her. I feel any way I do will just result In her saying ‚Äúbut I was broke that day‚Äù or ‚Äúyou said it‚Äôs fine‚Äù. I‚Äôve tried just moving past it for the last week but I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it and I find myself not wanting to see her. She has just been carrying on like everything is fine. 
If anyone can tell me a good way to bring it up and talk to her neutrally about my feelings ease let me know. 

TLDR mother tells me she will take me out to dinner, then tells me she can‚Äôt because she‚Äôs broke. However she spend money on her cat, home office and the lottery",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcgxpt/mother_spends_money_on_her_cat_then_tells_me_she/,,leaw20,pcgxpt,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcgxpt/mother_spends_money_on_her_cat_then_tells_me_she/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcgxpt/mother_spends_money_on_her_cat_then_tells_me_she/,2,2021-08-27

Terminated from contract,"
Hello, I don‚Äôt know much about working as an independent contractor, but over the past 3 months have been stressful and triggered a lot of mental health issues while working.

I worked as Community Patrol on a reservation in Minnesota, basically I drove around for 8 hours in a district that took 1 hour and 20 minutes to go back and forth to do an entire run for my job. 

Plus, I was able to communicate with the police for any incidents that happened during my shift.

Anyway, the last 4 weeks before I was terminated through text message, I was asked to train in a new coworker after a tragic incident that happened in the district that I work in; I was triggered and started having PTSD episodes after hearing the incident because that could of happened last year for me.

I have told my supervisor and second in command (our timesheet worker), about me having theses issues, and they said that I could take time off after I train in the new coworker for my regular days and hours, so, I agree.

After training week was up, and we had another meeting, my supervisor asked if we could take another week of training, I was irritated, but agreed to do another week, but while on the second week of training, my coworker smelled like marijuana.

I did tell my coworker that it‚Äôs best to be sober since we work with the community and police altogether, but then the next work week, my coworker then said, I‚Äôll be straight up about it and don‚Äôt want to lie to me about smoking again, but I said it once again, it‚Äôs best to be sober.

Then the following 12 hours before I started my shift, the work truck reeked of marijuana, and I let my supervisor know about the situation, but he basically told us that whatever we do off shift doesn‚Äôt matter him unless on duty to not do it at all.

I told the cops about the situation since we were a foot away from them one night, and they said, we both could of been arrested, even if I was sober because I let it happen.

Anyway, after working 2 days without my coworker, but the third day, there was funeral at the place where I clock in, and I wanted to leave quickly, so I left my house keys and car charger. 

I went home to take a break from driving, (bathroom/eat/and rest up), my coworker messaged me of needing a ride to work @ 10, but then messaged again saying they are not feeling good. 

I didn‚Äôt message back since I was distracted by the movie that was left on, then I remembered how cold it was, so I changed clothes quickly since it was almost time to leave.

Ended up locking myself out of the house for 10 minutes until my brother woke up, so that I can grab the truck key from the dirty clothes, then realizing that my phone was about to die.

I just had in my head that my coworker wasn‚Äôt feeling good, so, I did another that took an 45 minutes out east, and finally did another run out west that took about 25 since I went back to get charger.

My supervisor had messaged me during the time that my phone was still off until 30 minutes later that I got phone charged enough to check, he called during I was texting him back, but basically didn‚Äôt give me a chance to tell my side of the story.

He texted me an incident that happened, but no time, and this is the second incident that was out of my control since I wasn‚Äôt told when it happened again, just whereabouts, except an estimated time for the first one that happened during my break again.

There‚Äôs nothing written about our break times, or where to take them as well, and I usually use my main breaks to rest up since we have to be focused and alert at all times while driving.

Plus, I wasn‚Äôt told I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be working on final work day until I asked where the work truck was at, then my supervisor said we‚Äôll have a meeting the next day, but changed it to be after my days off.

After my days off were over, and I was on my way to work, I get a message saying that my contract was terminated through a text without even going to a meeting that my supervisor talked about.

The next day, I asked for my check and A copy of my contract since I never received one in the first place, but my supervisor messaged me back with ‚Äúfor what?‚Äù since he terminated me.

I have a copy now, (I didn‚Äôt get it from them), and everything he told us wasn‚Äôt in writing form, only text messages, and that was part of the agreements, I signed up for in may of this year.

Nothing makes sense to me, help please.",legaladvice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/pcnit9/terminated_from_contract/,,Lean_Loud,pcnit9,/r/legaladvice/comments/pcnit9/terminated_from_contract/,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/pcnit9/terminated_from_contract/,1,2021-08-27

[F4A] Can you seduce me in realistic scenarios?,"Hello! I have always liked the idea of having a roleplay where I play myself as realistically as I can in my real current or a real past life situation. I am shy and quiet and introvert and so I think this is difficult!



But it makes it so much fun to try and imagine if someone actually did it! It'd make me dizzy. I have split it into 4 difficulties, so please include the level selected if you message me! But these are mainly just suggestions we can create custom scenarios too.

 How far can you get my shy nerdy self to go? Will I be blushing as I remove my top to give you a quick peek in a mall bathroom? Can you get me to drool on your cock even if my husband is around the corner? Or can you go all the way and have me spread my legs and let you cum inside? I wish you luck, I'm already wet hoping you try your best. 


Easy:

Age: 18
Situation: At the mall with my mom, we're shopping for clothes in a large store. You are a customer there as well. We don't know each other,  but I catch your eye. The store doesn't have the best changing room, so you get a decent look watching me shop. I'd like if you struck up a conversation and we ended up leaving the store. There are lots of hidden places I could suck your cock, or I could even go home with you. This scene I am the freest of them, there with my mom but no significant other holding me back so when we click I can go all in. You'll have to show this virgin the ropes though. 

Bonus: You start off knowing my three biggest kinks


Medium:

Age: 23

Situation: Attending school &amp; living with my boyfriend. You're a student in my courses, and we've been assigned a group project. There are four other group members but this still means you have me alone (kinda) in a library study room for long periods of time. Maybe the others get tired but we want to stick it out, how long until we realize we are alone in a mostly abandoned campus at 2am? How long after that before we're making out on the table...


Bonus: You know the few times I am alone during commute


Hard:
Age: 25

Situation: Working, living with my brother &amp; husband. You're my co-worker, we don't work closely together but we have chatted in the lunch room. You know I'm married. But, for me the uniform is yoga pants so you see them stretched over my big ass every day.  I'm stressed and normally drive home for lunch, but today I'm having car troubles. 

Bonus: None


Insane: 
Age: Current Day
Situation: Details in PM
Bonus: Anti-Bonus, if you get caught by my husband it's game over and we restart.





Points:

Touching intimate areas: 10

Remove clothes: 15 each, 30 bra, 35 panties

Kiss: 100

Finger: 50

Oral: 150

Sex: 500

You rim me: 150

I rim you: 250

Anal: 550

Getting me to do your unusual kink: 1,000




Easy modifer x 0.5

Medium modifier x 1.5 

Hard modifier x 2

Insane modifier x 5




If you consent I can keep an ongoing hi-score list lol. 



And final warning, in case this isn't clear this may be quite frustrating, I won't be easy to seduce! For those who like realism and a challenge. But I won't slack on roleplaying! I can describe myself, my actions, how my face looks trying to figure you out, etc",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pcnue8/f4a_can_you_seduce_me_in_realistic_scenarios/,,Depth-Far,pcnue8,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pcnue8/f4a_can_you_seduce_me_in_realistic_scenarios/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pcnue8/f4a_can_you_seduce_me_in_realistic_scenarios/,1,2021-08-27

Should I get back with my ex?,"We dated for almost 2 years, at the beggining everything was perfect, we had a great chemistry, i was her first, we didnt argue at all but after some time we started arguing a lot. She tends to be very jelous (forbiding me to meet my BFF which is girl) and needy for attention and I (realized it after breakup) have a minor problem with alcohol and used to prioritize drinking with my buddies over spendig time with her. Weve been broken up for 6weeks, I really love her and every day without her is torture, i constantly think of her, have daily panic attacks, which is weird since i have never been depressed before. The breakup was somewhat mutual, first I was the one to push it because I was sick of her behavior and she talked me into a pause and not brekaup so i said ok and then i made some mistakes and she said that she wants to breakup and i said yes. After that she wanted to get back together for a week or two but i said no, because i knew that nothing from her behavior would change and that she would forbid me to meet with my best friend alltogether cause she doesnt like the fact that my best friend is a female. After few weeks i started miss her more and more and being more and more depressed and now I realize the mistakes I made in the relationship, I stopped drinking but Im not sure if she would change anything.
On the other hand, Im not even sure If she would wanna get back together. We met after the brekaup to give eachother our stuff and she told me she will always like me and be there for me and i said the same thing. I messaged her ""Hi"" the other day coz I miss her amd wanted to talk for a bit but she gave me a seen and didnt reply, after that i saw that she posted a story on ig wishing some other guy a happy birthday, that hurt me a lot. Even tho we dont follow eachother i checkout her stories coz im interested what shes doing and how she is but she never checks mine. I feel like she moved on even tho she told me even after the breakup that she loves me and does not know how to stop loving me and wishes that we find way to oneanother. 
I moved to another country to work cause everything reminded me of her whoch could make getting back together harder, but im willing to come back home for her or to try to make it work even thru distance. I just know I wanna be with her. We planned our future together and now everything seems pointless. The thought that she found someone else and doesnt feel absolutely anything for me is very scary and it hurts me that its a possibility. I tried to hang myself the other day but the lamp to which the rope was tied teared off the ceiling, so yeah im that fucked up by this situation. 

If you have some advice what to do, or how to get her back I would be gratefull.

I don‚Äôt feel connected to anyone,"I don‚Äôt feel connected to any of my friends. We are a group of 10 and everytime we meet up I just feel totally empty, but so anxious at the same time. I cant tell if it is the people (they are lovely but we are different, e.g. they like drinking, I do not, so most of our meet-ups involve drunk people and sober me) or will I always feel this way no matter who the people are?

I want someone to swoop in and save me from feeling so lonely. I need someone who I can be my true self with and be vulnerable and feel comfortable communicating my needs to. 

I feel okay by myself a lot of the time, but sometimes it just gets too much. 

Do ‚Äúsoul mates‚Äù even exist? Will someone come along sometime who i feel truly connected to and who loves me as much as i love them? 

I don‚Äôt do well in group settings at all, so it would be such a blessing for me to find that one person who just feels like HOME. and who feels the exact same way about me too. 

I literally pray every night to some magical universe being to send me a person. I need something to change soon. 

I try so hard to make connections with people, but it ends everytime after a matter of months, when I realise they just do not care for me at all. I cannot tel if something I do is pushing everyone away, if I just need to be patient, or maybe my standards are way too high?

When should I [26M] ask her what she's [23F] looking for?,"Met this girl on tinder, we hit it off quick and we've seen each other 5 times already.

First 3 times were quick and casual (drinks, walk around the park, and a museum), but the 4th time was dinner, an interactive museum, and drinks and what I thought was going to be just dinner (she's busy applying to grad school) and at most 2 hours turned into almost 8 hours with me driving her home at almost 2 in the morning. She invited me up and I went with her but I left shortly afterwards because I was pretty tired. Looking back I probably should've grabbed her hand when walking around the museum or something. She kept giving me hints like punching me gently when I say something stupid but I've been out of the dating game for so long I only see these things way after they happen HAHA FML.

the most recent one she invited me over to drink with her 2 close friends and she told me to stay the night because we were all drunk. She offered the couch or her bed so naturally I chose the bed (yes, because I could sleep next to her but also I have chronic back pain lmao). No funny business happened because we were both drunk and I don't like making the first intimate connection with a new person under the influence, and maybe she was just being nice and thoughtful.

However, during the night (when we were drinking, not in bed) she told me she's just been out of a relationship a month (or 2?) ago and I'm kinda scared because that's fairly recent  (I'm looking for a relationship).

I really like her and next time I definitely want to ask her what she's looking for when she made a tinder, but I just dont know how to approach it. I'm super anxious af in general and awkward, but I think(?) she likes me? But if she says that she's just looking around for now or just casual then I'm scared that the disappointment would show on my face and in my tone of voice. However, I prefer to ask her in person rather than text because it is an important question?

I hate my (27) ‚Äú50/50‚Äù marriage. Is there any way to change my husband (28)?,":(

Everything is 50/50. 

It‚Äôs not just money.  

He asked me to go 50/50 on changing DIAPERS. I WORK FROM HOME. I change all the diapers 5 days a week until he‚Äôs home. If you want to go 50/50 on diapers, then every diaper that is needed, ever, when you‚Äôre not working, is yours. If you want ‚Äúequality and 50/50‚Äù, then we don‚Äôt need to take turns when you‚Äôre not working if I do ALL the diapers for 45 hours a week. 

And nothing is given freely, ever. If he says he wants lunch, and he pays for my lunch, and then asks if I want ice cream, he will not take out his wallet, even though he suggested ice cream in the first place. He just expects it. It‚Äôs never a treat or a surprise. He expects something in return. I‚Äôm sorry, but if one person is paying, shouldn‚Äôt the person who ASKED for it pay? It would be *different* if I ask. 

One time, he said he wanted food on the way home, and I said I didn‚Äôt have my wallet. He changed his mind. When we got home, he suddenly wanted to go out again. 15 minutes later. When I had my wallet.... coincidence? No. He even asked me to grab my wallet. I declined. If you wanted food so badly, you can pay for it. 

And I know, I sound snotty, but it‚Äôs not 50/50 when I end up paying more. And I do. More towards the kid, more towards food. More. 

Nothing is 50/50, ever, and money isn‚Äôt the basis. It‚Äôs everything. You don‚Äôt just change a diaper, or clean, you keep track of what you‚Äôre doing. Everything is tit for tat. 

Like, I‚Äôm pregnant (*I know*). And he still expects 50/50 (which isn‚Äôt even 50/50 because I watch the child while I work which also affects my speed of working, *and* my income). I don‚Äôt even get a chance to sleep more while pregnant, in the name of ~equality~. It‚Äôs supposedly unfair for me to ask him to watch the baby so I can rest. While growing a literal human.

This whole marriage feels like a business transaction. Especially when the baby poops and he tells me so. Okay? What are you going to do about it? Sit here and wait for me to do it since you changed the last one? No. You were with the child, and I was in another room, you can change it. You wanted ice cream, you can buy it. 

Like, we don‚Äôt need to tally everything. We can take turns with diapers. If I am with the baby and she needs a diaper, I won‚Äôt go out of my way to ask you for the sake of being equal. Jesus. It‚Äôs called being a parent. 

Everything is 50/50. 

It‚Äôs not just money. 

Everything. 

Ugh. 

Anyways, is it possible to change a 50/50 man? Has anyone done it? Or, is this a dead horse? I‚Äôm so unhappy and so miserable because it just feels like we are taking tabs. We never do anything freely or out of love because something is alway expected in return. It‚Äôs just tiresome. I lost the romance. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this? Because I do love him. I just hate the dynamic.  

Tl;dr. Husband is so obsessed with the idea of 50/50 that he keeps tabs on everything (even diaper changes). He never gives me anything freely ‚Äújust because‚Äù.  In his head, he‚Äôs waiting for me to do something next in return. I hate this arrangement and it isn‚Äôt 50/50 at all. It‚Äôs unfair to me. I‚Äôm losing on so much.

Another dumbass Spider-Man No Way Home theory,"I don't know if I just did some major breakthrough or I'm really just slow and stupid but what if all of the Sinister Six in NWH are just variants of their original characters from their respect universes like how Loki was a variant of himself in the series. And the reason why they are variants is because of Dr Strange accidentally pulling them away from their own universes.

37 [M4F] - FL/NJ - Looking for someone to build a long-term friendship/connect with.,"
Hey everyone! My name is Dan and I‚Äôm 37 and have a 7 year old daughter. I am originally from NJ but moved to FL a few years ago, isolating ourselves from friends and family back home and for me it‚Äôs been a really really tough adjustment. I was also diagnosed with situational depression because of this which doesn‚Äôt make it any easier. I would love to find someone else in the same or similar predicament as i am but its not a necessity. First and foremost i am basically looking for my ‚Äúpersonality ‚Äú doppelg√§nger who I can hopefully become great friends with!

&amp;#x200B;

Back home I would always go to the movies with my brothers or drive to stores looking for nerdy things to collect. I am normally a huge family person but since being away i can only get facetime family time unfortunately. Which doesn't help my depression much. Facetime is great and all, but its not the real thing.

&amp;#x200B;

So I‚Äôm looking for someone that shares the same mindset as i do. Someone that is genuinely looking for someone to connect with and talk about anything with. I absolutely love reminiscing about growing up and what we watched and played with as kids, so i would definitely love to share childhood stories! I'm a huge 80s &amp; 90s everything fan! So you could always start the conversation with your top few TV Shows &amp; Movies! I love using GIFs so you if you send them that way, i do like to try and guess them!

&amp;#x200B;

So if you think you share similar interests and would like to talk about anything feel free to message me! Or even if you are homesick like i am and would like to talk about it, I‚Äôd be more than happy to talk!

&amp;#x200B;

I am not into the whole 420 thing, unless you are doing it for medical reasons only. One other thing to note is that i don‚Äôt drink, however, i also have no issues with people who do. Its just not the lifestyle for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I prefer if you are in the US, but again, not a necessity!

&amp;#x200B;

An acceptable age range for me is 26-46. You don‚Äôt have to have kids but my daughter is everything to me so it would help if you at least like them!

&amp;#x200B;

All I ask is that you actually want to get to know me.‚ò∫Ô∏è

&amp;#x200B;

I am a graphic designer and have a really sweet job! I am a nerd/kid at heart with a fun/silly sense of humor. I love to laugh and i love trying to make others laugh. I am also an introvert but once you get to know me that kind of fades. My hobbies include:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Gaming

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm an Xbox Achievement hunter mostly but i don‚Äôt JUST play for that. I am into a ton of different games so if you would like to play any I will definitely be open to it! I have PC, VR, Xbox, Switch, PS5 and Xbox One. Favorite game series is Legend of Zelda! Also LOVE to play Beat Saber. (I like to get the custom made real songs though mostly)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Collecting Action figures and retro games

\- Playing board games and also making them (i‚Äôve made a couple)

\- Playing Magic the Gathering (new at it)

\- I also like to play Pok√©mon GO and TCG

\- I write here and there (fantasy themed) and also trying to make my own video game!

&amp;#x200B;

I like going to arcades, mini golf, bowling, disney parks and universal.

&amp;#x200B;

My interests include:

\- TV/Movies 

\- Listening to music

\- Fantasy and sci fi everything

\- Star Wars

\- Lord of the Rings

\- Professional Wrestling WWE/AEW

\- Football

\- Nintendo/retro games

\- Dragonball Series

\- Disney

\- Marvel/DC

\- Anything 80s/90s

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to message me if you think we‚Äôd get along! I prefer Chat or DMs but either works fine!

"Was this sexual assault? (f/f, so not rape, right?)","I'm so sorry if this is not the right place to put this, but I was taught in school that f/f unwanted sex was not rape, but sexual assault?

Anyway, I'm not sure if this was assault, but I'm just realising that something about this was not right. I just want to say real quick that I honestly feel so disgusted by this relationship and I regret everything that we did. I was such a dumb child.

----

In 2019 I got into my first relationship with a girl. I was 15, she was 14. We took things super slow and didn't even kiss until over a month into the relationship because I was scared and not ready to do anything with a girl.

About 3 months into the relationship things got pretty heated and we started having 'sex', except... I was not allowed round her house and she was not allowed round mine because her parents were homophobic, so we had sex in the woods every time we met up, which was like once or twice a week after we spent the day together at school.

She went into the woods on her own one day and went looking for a spot 'for us'. I had no idea she was doing that at the time and am now realising how weird it was. It was an area in the woods that had two benches and was surrounded by bushes and trees.

One day, she was sitting on the bench and I was on her lap grinding on her fingers. We never spoke about doing this, but she decided to use her other hand and put her fingers in *another hole*. I was shocked, disgusted and confused, so I didn't say anything and instead just pretended to finish.

Later that day, I got home and she texted me about it and I just pretended that I was fine with it, like I enjoyed it, so she kept doing it.

I felt so disgusting and that's when I realised that what we were doing was SO wrong. It just felt so normal because I had never been in a sexual relationship before her. I thought that this was just something that all teens do.

I asked her if we could stop having sex in public spaces and instead just wait until we were older or until her parents were ok with it or something. She agreed, but a few days later at school we were hanging out in the basketball court (where no one was allowed), and she put her hands down my skirt and tights and fingered me. She did this A LOT and later ignored what we said about public spaces and would randomly finger me in alleyways on the way home. Suddenly, she'd just put her hands down my skirt out of no where, even sometimes in the classrooms at school.

I always felt bad after because I felt like I never touched her and she was always touching me. I always apologised over text when I got home, but she told me it was fine because she liked touching me.

The reason I'm not sure if this was all wrong or not is because a little while after her fingers were inside me, she'd always ask 'is this ok?' and I'd always say yes because her fingers were alread inside me.

Need advice on how to act next,"Hey everyone, this is my first post of this nature, I hope it's not too long. 

So I was out of the game for some time as I had a girlfriend until recently. 
Throughout my time in a relationship I've managed to stack up a few good pictures of myself as well as gain a deeper understanding of how things work, so upon my return to the dating scene I was able to put together a far greater profile than I ever had before. 

The quality of my matches improved a lot and this Monday I had my first first date this year, which would easily make my all time top 10% looks wise. And that's the girl the rest of the post will be about. 

She was fun and outgoing, things went very smoothly. I had good expectations as it was her idea to meet up the same night after I asked out for a drink ""some day"". A lot of my jokes worked really well. She's given me a few shit tests and I believe they all failed to embarrass me or make me feel uncomfortable. We had the same sort of vibe/aesthetic/music taste which also doesn't hurt. 

At some point she briefly mentioned that she got out of a three year relationship (she's 24), I didn't react to it in a way, but it's just given me more confidence as I thought she's probably hungry for a chance to explore, or maybe I'm being a rebound which only makes things easier.

The bar had a bench and while having the second drink she was sitting super close in my personal space, but wasn't keen on escalating things physically and making out just yet. It was surprising, but I calibrated my approach and carried on with the date. Shortly after the bar closed down and she suggested we'd head to the beach. 

The beach time was great, we had more beers, I brought a speaker and we we're blasting our favorite songs while dancing and singing along together, it was like a party of two people and a cool bonding moment, the dancing itself had even gotten a little sexual a few times. 

Then we decided to switch it up and suggested a spot where we could hang out with a little more privacy, where I then started playing music that's a little more chill and slowly led the interaction to our first make out, which then slowly became very intense, with a lot of heavy petting and even dry humping. 

A few times it felt like she was trying to provoke me into acting overly thirsty, but I didn't give into it as she had previously complained about constantly dealing with various men being creepy towards her in every day life.

It was getting late and we started going home, she warned me that were not going to hook up that night, but also mentioned that I'm the first guy other than her boyfriend she had made out with in over three years. As we were walking home she seemed super into me, I had my hand around her the entire time and she would stop to look at me kiss every couple of minutes, it was cute. She was also repeatedly saying that she likes me, but I was hesitant to respond with the same level of affection, so I won't have my cards open in case it's just the alcohol talking. 

By the time we got hers, she invited me to sleep with her, but once again warned me that sex was not going to happen because it's the first date and she's not that kinda girl. It didn't bother me at all as I myself would rather save or first time for when I'm less tired and more sober. 

We couldn't fall a sleep for hours making out, cuddling, dry humping and just being all over each other like crazy. We basically just had hours of intense role-play leading to nothing, I'm not sure if I've ever seen a girl so so turned on before. At some point she even gave me some head and asked to be penetrated, but only for a few pumps. (Lol, I know, I'm was just as surprised as you are)

I had to wake up early to go to work and she wouldn't let me leave clinging onto me, jokingly trying to get me back in bed. She asked me to send her my number on tinder and went back to sleep as I left. 
I was home thirty minutes later and when I looked at my phone, I saw that she had just followed me on ig. 

I had briefly mentioned my ig nickname early on as it was a pun on a the name of the band we enjoy, which I thought was clever. I was flattered she actually remembered it. 

I hit her up later that day, which I normally don't do, but it felt right after a date like this and also she basically made me promise I'll do that. We agreed to talk again on Wednesday and make plans to get together. Which seems very soon, but since sex didn't actually happen, I just wanted to get it out of the way asap before she starts coming up with more reasons for why she didn't sleep with me. 

I hit her up the day we were supposed to meet to suggest we take a walk to this cool sunset spot on the hill and she responds saying she'd rather go for a drink nearby as she has to get up early the next day, so she wants to be in bed by midnight. That was unexpected as she's currently on vacation, but lives in the city. 

I showed up for a date being convinced it's just a formality for us to have sex. The date didn't start of smoothly as all of the spots we had in mind were full due to covid restrictions and we just spent an annoyingly large amount of time trying to find a bar where we could sit. The conversation felt very platonic and I didn't see a lot opportunities to escalate it/spice things up, it was also super crowded everywhere, kinda made it difficult to set the right atmosphere.

We then chilled on a blanket in a little park, the convo felt a tiny bit more intimate, we shared some stuff with each other, but the overall date really didn't leave up to the expectations the first one had set. She seemed tired the whole time, which might've had something to do with it, but the thing that bothers me is that her morning plan was something she could do literally any other day and had absolutely no reason to plan it the day after the date, neither she had a reason to be so determined to stick to that plan. 
I walked her home, we made out a bit, and as you might've guessed I wasn't invited upstairs. Upon saying goodbye she said see you, but didn't sound very enthusiastic, I left feeling very let down, but made sure I wasn't showing it. 

So here's the thing that's on my mind right now, normally I'd stop any attempts to see her for some time and wait until she reaches out. If she won't, I would maybe try to text her once and forget about her forever if doesn't go well. BUT!! 

She's leaving town for two weeks on Monday and I'm thinking should I try to make plans again before she leaves. The logistics are difficult as she might need to spend her Sunday preparing and then once again go to sleep earlier, and I've always thought Friday and Saturday we're terrible days for setting a because as a high value man you should have fun things happening in your life on the weekend, or as a popular young guy that I'm trying to portray myself as, I should be invited to parties and stuff. 

I really want to see her again or maybe even start seeing her continuously, but don't want to bend over backwards to do it. She reached out to me last night at 4 am asking if I'm still up, I didn't respond until the morning cause I was asleep, but when I did respond to her, she didn't continue trying to make plans. She also liked my social media post yesterday, but I am still not convinced that trying to get her on a date these next three days would do me more good than bad. At the same time I'm afraid a two week vacation would just be too long and I'll miss my chance. 

I would greatly appreciate any advice, I've never dealt with anything remotely like this.

TL:DR

Had an amazing first date, the girl was super into me and I ended up sleeping at hers without hooking up. The second date was meh and now she leaves town for two weeks on Monday, idk what to do.",seduction,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/pcm6du/need_advice_on_how_to_act_next/,Field Report :orly:,unfortunately_real,pcm6du,/r/seduction/comments/pcm6du/need_advice_on_how_to_act_next/,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/pcm6du/need_advice_on_how_to_act_next/,2,2021-08-27

No car ride to the airport? OK!,"Back in my younger days - 2 jobs ago - I ended up traveling a fair bit for my company. It wasn't something that was in my official job description, I just managed to inherit being the on-site face for a particularly demanding customer. Somehow, even though I didn't know much about the SW running on the HW at the layer they were interfacing with (I'm happiest scraping my knuckles in the hardware), I had been in a position to be able to stop by on my way back from a week-long conference on my way back. All I did that time was take notes, and give the customer that warm fuzzy feeling that having someone onsite from your vendor tends to give. Anyways. I flew. A lot.

I live in New England. The cheapest place to fly from in terms of airline tickets at the time was Logan. For those of you that don't know, getting to/from Logan SUCKS. It's an older airport. It's stuck in the middle of the city. There is literally no good way to get in or out. I live north of Boston in southern NH. Either you're flying at Oh-Dark-Thirty (and thus getting up even earlier) or you're slaying the awful traffic dragons.

I prefer to fly in early if I can, which means an early rise time. Yes, I know, don't do anything for the company you're not paid for. In my mind - I'd rather get up super early, get the work done, and get home to my family and sleep in MY bed. Just a better sleep. Had nothing to do with saving my company money.

When I started flying for the company it had a policy of providing car service to/from the airport. So I could literally get up, shower, dress, fall into the car, and sleep the hour+ to the airport. At some point the company decided in its infinite wisdom to no longer provide car service for trips lasting less than 4 days. Why? I don't know. They just did.

That was the end of my flights out of Logan. We have this much smaller airport up in Manchester. It is literally less than half an hour from my house. It's very easy to get in and out of. It has an access road right from the highway. I usually drive against traffic when going to/coming from the airport. IT. IS. AWESOME. Except, at the time I was traveling for the company, it was also significantly more expensive to fly out of. (Just checked recently, it's actually cheaper to fly out of, at least w/Southwest, than logan at the moment...) Between my parking costs (I parked as close to the terminal as possible in the garage, so my car would be out of the elements), my mileage allowance, and the ticket price differential, I more than made up the difference that the professional car cost the company. The company didn't put restrictions on which airport we flew out of. Just, no car service.

Less stress for me - not worrying about whether we'd make it to the airport. Later wake up times. Quicker back home at the end of the day. Win-win for me.

TL;DR: company took away car service to airport. I pivoted to much closer airport resulting in higher net cost to the company.",MaliciousCompliance,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/pclrap/no_car_ride_to_the_airport_ok/,M,MusicalMerlin1973,pclrap,/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/pclrap/no_car_ride_to_the_airport_ok/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/pclrap/no_car_ride_to_the_airport_ok/,17,2021-08-27
"F4A Would you still love me if I was the ""fat one""","Hello everyone,

I absolutely love role reversal and using weight as the proxy if power.

So I'm looking for someone who is interested in being my 600+ pound partner. I would prefer we be a fxf pairing but can discuss if that's a deal breaker.

Your character is someone who has been big all of their life and never known what it felt like to ever be skinny, popular, desired or well liked. In school you were always the fattest girl in school and once puberty hit your weight really took off. You were over 450 pounds when you graduated high school. It wasn't for a lack of trying to diet, as you tried every diet you could but most wouldn't last the day and any diet that did make it a few days to a week would then end with a massive binge that wouldn't stop until anything that was lost came back and then some. Which of course made you feel bad and guilty which made you eat more. Food became your answer to everything as it was seemingly the only thing that brought you comfort. You hated what you were but was also tired of fighting it.

That's when we met, you were so shy, meek and so unsure of yourself, I knew I could make you mine in the blink of an eye. I flashed you a smile and batted my eyes and you were so nervous at first as you didn't know how to react to the attention. I saw potential in you, you were big but if pushed you could become bigger....much bigger and it didn't take much.

That was 5 years ago.....

We became a couple and the adventure began. The way you looked at me, I could tell you adored me. You hung on every word I said could never understand how someone as smart, confident and beautiful like me could ever be with someone like you. All you wanted to do was make me happy and while you would of done or gave just about anything to not have the body and life that you had, you had me and that made it worth it. That and your will power against food was basically non-existent. I kept junk food around you at all times as I loved watching you grow, watching you become lazier and listening to your breathing as just going to the bathroom had become a chore for you.

We were happy, for the most part as you may of hated yourself, you had me and I was so perfect, it made it worth it. And so many told me I could do so much better than you and no one understood why I was weighing myself down with you but I had security in you. I knew that you would never leave me, I had been broken up with before and I didn't want it to happen again. And I could never tell anyone else but I had a fat fetish and I loved watching you grow but lately I've found myself feeling the floor vibrate with your steps or hearing you groan as you lowered or raised yourself off the couch or was devouring on of your 4 or 5 meals of the day. I find myself wondering how different things would be if I were the ""fat one"". Would you still love me and look at me the same? Of course you would right? Our bodies and our weight doesn't determine who or what we are right?

As you hitting 600 pounds was quite the milestone, its also turned you into more of a chore and has made me bored or unsatisfied, not realizing that you've become and are everything I ever wanted. I now still want more.

So I tell you one night we should switch places, make me the fat one and ill devote all my time to training you to be like me. Which the idea of you being like me is a dream come true, you are against it as you know how miserable your life is, especially when you're home alone and I'm at work and don't want to see me like that but also you feared change and feared you wouldn't be good enough and would just end up leaving me. Which I don't realize your fears of change causing a breakup were more than justified except it wouldn't be me doing the breaking up, it would be you. As when your at 600 pounds I'm your whole world, however when you're skinny and I'm at 600 pounds, I'll be whats holding you back from the world, a world you've dreamed of being a part of and living in since you were a little girl.

Needless to say I use my alpha status to get you on board and its a struggle at first and you weren't the happiest being denied food but if you didn't have the willpower then I was going to use mine to will you through. Then as we start to take your appetite, we start on in home exercises, all while I'm eating the junk food right in front of you, so you don't eat it. 

I start to teach you to become stronger and you start to like how it feels. Suddenly you'll start finding yourself having your food addiction replaced with becoming stronger and better. In the back of your mind telling yourself that you were only doing this and going through all this to make me happy, which may of been true at the beginning but at some point you'll stop doing it for me and start doing it for yourself and I won't realize it but it'll be in that moment ill start to lose my control over you and possibly inevitably lead to my once 600 pound partner running away from me.

As I don't realize how empowering you will change you, how it'll make you want more, which shouldn't of surprised me as you always wanted more, just like me, maybe that's why we made such a good pairing. What I also don't think about is that I'm growing into a body you spent your whole life looking into the mirror and hating. So as I grow, the sparkle of which use to fill your eyes when you looked at me will fade.

Now the ending can go however we want but am looking for maybe a bit of a darker ending. Where you find that you have fallen out of love with me as I'm no longer anything special to you and you'll be the one for the first time ever that can do better and you owe it to yourself to see what's out there as you've spent enough time chained inside. And while you'll appreciate all I've done, you just won't be the same person anymore and I'll no longer be the girl you fell in love with. I'll just be a constant reminder of what you once were and the life you once had. A life that once able to, couldn't run away from fast enough.

If this interests you or feel may have similar interests, please feel free to message me on here or on my Discord. I look forward to hearing from you. :)

Marble League 2021 Power Rankings After Event 12: Diving," What‚Äôs up fellas? Welcome back to the power rankings, we‚Äôre coming at you live from Diving. Honestly, it really didn‚Äôt need to come back, some fans just don‚Äôt grasp the concept that just because an event happened at some point doesn‚Äôt mean it has to come back again I guess. Oh well, I could at least see how this would be a good event, I wasn‚Äôt too thrilled myself, but with some better camera angles this could end up being a solid event. Regardless, the final 4 events of the Marble League are upon us, how do the teams stack up going into the next event? What is it again? Oh, it‚Äôs the Elimination Race. Yay‚Ä¶ somehow this is going to lead to the Oceanics being insulted, isn‚Äôt it? Well, some people say this is a great event, let‚Äôs see if they‚Äôre right. Scroll down a bit more to find the things that not even 50 people care about at this point, the rankings.

***Key: X Team. (Place in Event, Place in Standings, Spots Moved)***

**16. Minty Maniacs (15th, 15th, -1)**

What have we done to deserve this? Why are we so bad? The Minties have one top-half finish. ONE. It wasn‚Äôt even a medal. Even the 2017 Jungle Jumpers, the team that placed in the top half the least in history, did it twice in 12 events. And now look what happened, 15th, tied for our worst placement yet. I refuse to believe in the 3rd place curse, it‚Äôs completely stupid, *but it sure seems to affect me*. When I saw the dive, I just yelled ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I was not happy. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still mad. I should be used to my teams being complete garbage. I was hoping that I wouldn‚Äôt have to bust out operation no hope for a third consecutive year, but here we are. What am I supposed to get excited about anyway? Minty Swirl doing another event? Why should I be excited about any of them doing an event? They haven‚Äôt gotten a top half placement individually since last year. And the one time they raced on Gravitrax wasn‚Äôt anything inspiring either. I really can‚Äôt escape my teams sucking in the Marble League, it‚Äôs just inevitable now.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 16th (-1)*

**15. Rojo Rollers (10th, 16th, +1)**

Was a 10th in diving enough to get the Rollers out of last in the standings? Hell no. But with the Minties being dead, it was enough to get them out of last here. It looked really bad at the start, REALLY bad. It paled in comparison to the pupils, but then the Minties went and my dreams were crushed. For the Rojo Rollers, 10th is quite good. 6 points is a lot more than they usually get. Selfishly, I‚Äôm hoping that the next 4 events will yield them less than 13 points, but they won‚Äôt. They may be able to get out of last if they keep up the semi-passable pace, considering what the Minties have been doing. Technically they‚Äôre not eliminated from championship contention yet, but they will be very soon. We have next to nothing to base their potential elimination race performance off of, except that Rojo Cuatro is going, which, in short, means they‚Äôll do bad. The only thing at stake is seeing if Cuatro is better or worse than Tres, but I would rather not see another tank bowl. Everyone was rooting for you to make it back, but now we‚Äôre seeing why you never made it.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 15th (+1)*

**14. Limers (11th, 14th, =)**

This team has tormented me so much lately, possibly the worst team in the league, and we can‚Äôt even beat them. The Minties go, and of course, the Limers immediately do better. Great. From being better than the Oceanics for most of M1 S2 to qualifying while the Oceanics didn‚Äôt, and more, the Limers have managed to make things even worse. Not just for me, for them too, they‚Äôve been pretty dang awful ever since that bronze in Hurdles. A few top halves, sure, but two 14ths and now an 11th; they‚Äôve stuck to 14th for a while. In fact, they‚Äôll have an opportunity to break the record for the longest time in one position, currently held by‚Ä¶ the Oceanics. Yeah, they‚Äôll definitely do it. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll be good, they‚Äôll continue to be bad, but so will the two teams behind them. Speaking of doing bad, recently demoted Slimelime will be going in the Elimination Race. Literally why? Sublime won the Snowboard Cross in 2018, an event that‚Äôs similar enough, Limelime has been good enough, why use Slimelime here? I would say at least they won‚Äôt be in M1, but stranger things have happened.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 14th (=)*

**13. O‚Äôrangers (16th, 11th, -5)**

Sometimes, the universe just gives you a freebie. I needed one, and the O‚Äôrangers came through. I experienced inner peace when they completely failed their dive. It was glorious. Not only was one of my most hated teams in last place for the event, but they also usurped that title from one of my favorites. I know Tangerin isn‚Äôt very good at individual events, like, at all, but the decision to sub them out may have been the wrong one. Their previously elite performance in team events has since been downgraded to just alright. Yes, they got the bronze in Steeplechase, but I don‚Äôt think it makes up for 2 bottom-two finishes. I think a better idea would be to have Tangerin as a member, but have them do the number of events a reserve would usually do, and have Orangin do the opposite. They sit in 11th overall, the lowest in the standings they‚Äôve ever been after 12 events. Mandarin did terrible last time around, and now they don‚Äôt have the dumb track defect excuse to give them 2 extra points, let‚Äôs see if they can improve. It‚Äôs not just Mandarin either; the whole team needs to improve soon.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 12th (-4)*

**12. Crazy Cat‚Äôs Eyes (5th, 12th, +1)**

I‚Äôm actually able to do an analysis on each member of the Cat‚Äôs Eyes and what their dives were like, but what‚Äôs the point? They all did at least tolerable, one 2 and three 3‚Äôs. A consistent effort all around. Typically after a 4th and a 5th, a team would move up more than 1 or 2 spots, especially after being so low. However, the teams directly ahead of them have also done quite well recently, and with them being absolutely atrocious before that, no such treatment. Their position in the standings hasn‚Äôt changed, but they have been freed up to potentially make a charge to a higher position, being within one event of 4th place (although that is probably beyond their short-term reach). Red Eye, the marble who decided to remove any and all suspense from a tournament, will participate in the elimination race. Because I am who I am, they will do very well here. Watch them win a race by like 10 full seconds, just to relive the old days. No matter what happens, they‚Äôre still overrated. The Crazy Cat‚Äôs Eyes won‚Äôt be dominating the ML anytime soon, in fact, they probably won‚Äôt be close to a podium spot.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 11th (+1)*

**11. Gliding Glaciers (4th, 13th, +1)**

I feel like most people are just going to forget that you got 4th here. Most of the run sucked, except that one marble who happened to get a bullseye. Whoever they were, nice job. In the past 5 events, they have 4 top-half finishes, one of which was a bronze. Unfortunately, due to the sheer degree to which they sucked in the events before that, they still sit 13th in the standings. Or 12th? That extra point situation is funky. Whatever, it‚Äôs one point, it probably won‚Äôt affect anything, we shouldn‚Äôt be too concerned about it. Anyway, they are in basically the same position as the Cat‚Äôs Eyes when it comes to overall standings. Currently low, but in a position where they can move quite a bit. Their performance in the final events will decide their overall fate, as for now, they have placed their trust in their reserve, Sheet. I‚Äôm just gonna say it, it‚Äôs not funny. The only way it will be funny is if they win or something. Yes, oh Sheet is an easy joke to make, but so is Galacfifth, neither of them is funny. A year ago this team was retired, now they are‚Ä¶ honestly still forgettable.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 13th (=)*

**10. Hazers (3rd, 9th, +1)**

It feels like the Hazers should be called the Oceanics, maybe they should just trade names because they have clearly done much better in water events than the Oceanics have‚Ä¶ or any other team for that matter. Since the Hazers joined, they got the best time during the Underwater Race in the ML19 qualifiers, 4th in the said event that year, won gold in the Triathlon in ML 20, got bronze in the Aquathlon last year, another bronze in the Triathlon this year, and now bronze in Diving. Their aim was good enough to offset a pretty high sync penalty of 0.4. In fact, it was almost perfect as every marble landed in the three-point ring. That actually might be harder to do than to land a bullseye, because it happened three times. Oddly enough, they were the only team in the top 4 not to hit the bullseye. With the bronze, the Hazers have four medals, but their rough stretch as of late means they have a lot of ground to make up. Misty will be racing for the Hazers in the Elimination Race. They‚Äôre coming off a duo gold in Jousting, but got bottom-half in 2019‚Äôs edition of the event, so who knows how they‚Äôll do? It‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll get another good finish based on their track record. The Hazers trail the leaders by 35 points‚Ä¶ hey, where have we seen that before? It‚Äôs to a Fruit Circuit team as well. 

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 9th (+1)*

**9. Savage Speeders (14th, 5th, -2)**

It honestly feels criminal to put the Speeders this low, especially when they sit in 5th, and this is honestly just inviting them to get gold to spit this prediction into my face. Knowing that, watch the Speeders pull another trophy/podium out of thin air. It seems that we have found the Speeders weak point though, as they are not good in jumping/diving events, having yet to podium in one. In fact, Diving was the worst performance of the season for the Speeders, resulting in their first Lead Cube Points. Now that the past is out of the way, how do the Speeders pull off another comeback to win a second consecutive title? The good news for them is that they‚Äôre only 23 points behind compared to 35 points from last year. The bad news? Unlike last year, there are four teams that the Speeders need to jump over. Even worse news, Whizzy is going in the Elimination Race, who just so happened to participate in the last two years in the 13th event (one of them being the Elimination Race). They got 12th and 16th. We‚Äôre either seeing a surprise medal here, or regular old Whizzy bringing the team down again. 

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 6th (-1)*

**8. Chocolatiers (7th, 10th, +1)**

A 7th place isn‚Äôt amazing, but it‚Äôs certainly an improvement over what we‚Äôve seen in other team events this year. The Chocolatiers may be relatively low in the standings, but they‚Äôre at the back of an extremely bunched up pack, so they‚Äôre not out of the ML yet. The only team to get 9 points from the targets meant that they slotted in 7th no matter what, but their sync wasn‚Äôt half bad either. The Chocolatiers are much more likely to move up than down, and with a series of individual events coming up, things may be looking up for the team. The only team event left is Football, and while the Choc doesn‚Äôt look like they know how to lead the team, they certainly turned in a good Ice Hockey performance in the Winter Special. Of course, it had to be against the Oceanics, but I won‚Äôt complain much regarding the Winter Special. Speaking of Choc, they will be racing for the team in Elimination Race. Bonbon got a nice 6th place, why can‚Äôt they do it again? Oh right, because they‚Äôre doing the Sand Rally. This team feels more like a Mocha/Bonbon duo right now than anything, Choc will need to pull their weight here if they want to disprove that and get the Chocolatiers higher up the order.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 10th (-1)*

**7. Shining Swarm (1st, 8th, +4)**

Roll over and roll out! The Shining Swarm turned in a remarkable performance for their second medal of ML 2021, as well as their second career victory. This time, there wasn‚Äôt a distraction because the event wasn‚Äôt stupidly dangerous for no reason. Scoring a 2, two 3‚Äôs and a bullseye was good enough to beat the Rockets‚Äô old record by a full point, and Shiny is turning heads with their captaincy once again. I‚Äôm still convinced that this was the best change in leadership out of any team; it‚Äôs what got the Swarm in the ML. As we reach the ¬æ mark of the league, the Shining Swarm have quietly jumped up to getting the third-best score out of the last four events alone, with 46 points. They trail only the Green Ducks (50) and Mellow Yellow in their prime (73). It‚Äôs a large sign of momentum for them to see if they can hang on to the competitiveness of this final stretch. Sterling will be racing in the Elimination Race, which is a good thing, as they‚Äôre a somewhat consistent marble for the Shining Swarm. An overall podium is certainly not out of the question, but the Swarm does need more of these performances, and there‚Äôs only one team event left.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 7th (+4)*

**6. Thunderbolts (6th, 6th, =)**

We ran a poll on the discord to see what would most likely happen to the Thunderbolts in the last four events. The options were: They get a medal, they get a Lead Cube point, both, or neither. 7 votes have said both will happen, which I find unlikely based on their performance. 5 votes including myself said neither will happen, 2 votes have an LC point awarded to them. No one said they will earn a medal. As for their performance, it was good, they had three 3‚Äôs, but simply ‚Äògood‚Äô isn‚Äôt good enough at this point. Two 4ths, three 5ths, and three 6ths are already responsible for half of their entire ML21 positions. Here‚Äôs the craziest part: the Thunderbolts are averaging the best rank of any team right now. That means if there were no medal point boosts, and rather, the scoring system went 15/14/13 down to 0, the Thunderbolts would be leading Marble League 2021. Instead, they are 26 points behind; more than a gold medal‚Äôs worth. I will laugh if they finish the season with no medals or LC points. The Thunderbolts opted for a change in Elimination Race, sending in Bolt instead of Shock. This is a good move, based on Bolt‚Äôs Winter Special Snowboard Cross performance. The Thunderbolts are great at avoiding the bottom in events, can they avoid the bottom in each race here?

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 5th (+2)*

**5. Team Momo (10th, 2nd, -1)**

Where was all that momentum from the first half? In the last four events, Team Momo has scored fewer points than the LIMERS. It goes without saying that this is not good for the team. For the first time aside from E4, Team Momo has lost the lead in the championship, and with the way things are going, they aren‚Äôt going to get it back. While the top three are well ahead of the rest of the field, one of them is the Raspberry Racers, who are the only ones that can statistically compare to the Speeders/O‚Äôrangers in the ML, and the other just got 70 points in three events. At the rate this is going, getting an overall podium is by no means guaranteed, which is just saddening to think about. Of course, they‚Äôre still in 5th because of their absurd first half and the fact that they haven‚Äôt *completely* dropped dead as of late, but it was only a matter of time. For the past five events, the lead has been in jeopardy. Let this be a wake-up call, rather than a sign you should just stop and be happy with what you‚Äôve achieved thus far. Mimo will be racing in Elimination Race, and as they‚Äôre not the most consistent marble in the book, I just can‚Äôt give Team Momo the benefit of the doubt here. A good finish or even a podium isn‚Äôt out of the question, because it is Mimo, but with the way things are going, it won‚Äôt happen.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 3rd (-1)*

**4. Raspberry Racers (8th, 3rd, +1)**

Yes, you fell in the standings, but this was still a win for the Racers in my eyes. Despite being usurped by the new ML leaders, the gap to Team Momo has now reached nearly the lowest it‚Äôs ever been, and the upcoming events are looking very promising for the team. The huge cushion back to 4th is also quite nice for the Raspberry Racers, as, at least in the short term, they don‚Äôt have to worry about falling out of podium contention. An average dive was helped by the Racers‚Äô good sync, as that‚Äôs what made the difference between them and the Ducks‚Äô performance in this event. The next event is the Elimination Race, in which the Racers also barely beat out the Ducks for the gold. This definitely harkens back to the days of ML19, where they won the Marble League despite only having one gold. Rezzy will be racing for the team, to no one‚Äôs surprise, but can they match the high expectations they have coming into this event. Despite the Racers seemingly always one-upping the Ducks whenever they can, the Racers simply haven‚Äôt been as solid in the past few events, so I can‚Äôt put them higher in the rankings. Rezzy has a shot at proving that the Raspberry Racers do have what it takes to one-up the Green Ducks once again, and get their team closer to their second title.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 2nd (+1)*

**3. Green Ducks (9th, 4th, =)**

It‚Äôs like after the Ducks got three silvers in a row, they got bored of it and donated their three-event form to the Indigo Stars, who then donated it to Mellow Yellow. Regardless, this doesn‚Äôt sit great for the Duckies, as this marks two bottom-half finishes since the silver medals. Ducky was disappointing in this ML overall, but really? Only 9th in a water event? Mallard is a pretty darn good captain too, especially since this should be your turf. The Ducks now find themselves well behind the top three, and will need another medal surge to compete for the title anytime soon. An overall podium is possible, but with how the standings are, the Green Ducks are much more likely to go down than up. That‚Äôs not to take away from what has still been a solid past few events, even with the missteps in Moguls and missed opportunities in Diving. Quacky will be participating for the Ducks in the Elimination Race, which is a no-brainer choice given that they got second in 2019‚Äôs edition. That being said, Quacky has been rather underwhelming aside from the Ducks‚Äô debut year in the ML, so it‚Äôs not a guaranteed good finish by any means. This event is an even greater opportunity than the previous for the Green Ducks to get into contention for the championship, so a lot is riding on how Quacky performs in this event.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 4th (=)*

**2. Indigo Stars (13th, 7th, =)**

Yeah, you‚Äôre not helping my mental stability either right now. Well, to be fair, you were before this event, but that did not look like it would yield a 13th when it happened, it felt like my teams deserved to be in the bottom 2. Shame that sync didn‚Äôt help at all, because the Stars had a really good score. Apart from a razor thin margin with the Shining Swarm, there is an equal gap 2 spots up and down for the Indigo Stars. 7 more points than the Speeders and they pass them, but 7 points less than the Hazers and they get passed. I‚Äôm not certain about where they will stand when it‚Äôs all said and done, hopefully they can finish somewhere in the midpack. The Elimination Race was a really good event for the Stars last year, finishing 4th, although I‚Äôm not certain that Diego will be able to replicate something of that caliber. As long as they get pretty close I won‚Äôt complain. That combined with the Sand Rally give them a nice next two events. If they don‚Äôt make a charge, their hopes for the title will likely be dashed, but I don‚Äôt see anything that could dash their hopes of becoming a mainstay in the Marble League.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 8th (-2)*

**1. Mellow Yellow (2nd, 1st, =)**

This is why Mellow Yellow moved up seven spots last week. Not only have they been ridiculous as of late, but the upcoming events suit them extremely well. Immediately after getting back to back golds, they get a silver that puts them on top of the Marble League standings. This now ties the record for the best 3 event stretch in ML history, tying the O‚Äôrangers 2020 events 2-4. This one is even more ridiculous though. The O‚Äôrangers had the Minty Maniacs hot on their trail even immediately after the hot streak, but for Mellow Yellow? Nobody is even close. The Indigo Stars are 2nd in the power rankings, and they got 13th. There is a good chance that even if Mellow Yellow places last next event, they will still lead the power rankings, they are THAT good. Yellup wasn‚Äôt exceptional in the last elimination race, but they still got 7th, if they can place similarly, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll experience any major problems. With the upcoming events and how the other teams up top have been performing as of late, it seems like Mellow Yellow is in a prime position to take this Marble League.

*JMR Power Ranking Discord Rank: 1st (=)*

And that‚Äôll do it. This Elimination Race should be better than the last one by default, considering Tide won‚Äôt get fired again, maybe if I‚Äôm lucky it won‚Äôt even be mentioned. We‚Äôre nearing the home stretch in the Marble League, and it‚Äôs closer than ever. Thanks to u/ramen_powder for contributing and to u/MidnightSpeeder (NW) for editing.

Small Rant about Covid-19 Situation,"**Foreword**: I might come off as cocky or whatever, but that's not what I'm trying to achieve. I'm just really annoyed by the current situation and I know there's a lot of people who feel like me, so I'm just going to put it out there.

Is anyone pissed off at the number of new cases and the possibility of having to go back in lockdown? Has anyone sacrificed their social life to try and not get - and pass - the virus, and then having to endure the fact that no one actually cares as long as they can drink and/or dance?

I haven't been able to go back to my home country since the beginning of the pandemic, I had to give up all social interactions and public places but I was hoping that this autumn would have been a great moment to go back and see my family, as cases were relatively low a couple of weeks back. Now I'm not sure 2021 is even an option at this point. How can we pretend we're in Tier 0 when we're one of the worst-hit countries? How is no one saying anything? Of course, it's my decision not to go; I could just get a plane and fly home but I do not, to protect my family, my household, and really anyone around. You could say I'm stupid for doing so and that I shouldn't worry about it, but I think the sea is made of drops and if we all acted that way, the situation would be way worse than it is. 

I get that people are tired, I guess that's absolutely normal given the situation; I'm tired too. But why do people who have actually paid attention and are grasping the last bit of patience left have to lose out while others are non-caring at all?

Isn't it better to just wait it out and, if really necessary, be egotistical after this thing is over, without having to worry about the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, etc. wave or whatever variant might pop up? 

I really don't get why but it seems like people have actually forgotten about it. Does anyone read the daily data? Or is it just water under the bridge for most?

Am I in the wrong here?,"Be honest. I‚Äôm here for that.  

I (26E) have two partners (25M and 26M) in a parallel setting. I‚Äôll try to give as much details as possible without compromising my anonymity. This is a throwaway because 25M follows me on Reddit.

- I‚Äôve been dating 26M for 4 years. // I‚Äôve been dating 25M for 10 months. 
26M feels secure in our relationship. // 25M not much, because of cohabitation issues. 
- 26M lives on his own and he keeps my cats because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to bring them to my current flat by the landlord, so I‚Äôm spending a lot of time at his place which is the main place from where I work. I have the keys and I can go there even if he‚Äôs not here. He lives very close. // 25M lives with his parents for health reason, I cannot visit him however I want. He lives a bit further away.
- I spend two evenings a week with 26M and two evenings a week with 25M, that are usually determined a week in advance.

I almost always have a 5 to 20 mins call to say goodnight to the partner I‚Äôm not spending the evening, with in order to catch up with their day and give them some news about mine. The call is made either after diner or right before going to sleep. 

If I have spent most of the day with the partner I‚Äôm not spending the evening with or am planning to do something time consuming with the partner I‚Äôm spending the evening with, I tell them we won‚Äôt call that day and instead say goodnight by text when I go to sleep. 

I‚Äôm a teacher for the very first year, not in the US. It works that way in my country : each year there is a national exam amongst student teachers and they select the 500 persons with the best scores. I studied my ass off last year and I was selected, after two tries.  Being a teacher is demanding because you bring work at home, the weekend, etc. We don‚Äôt have offices here, so we prepare our classes from home. We‚Äôre near September, which means I have tons of work and stuff to prepare for next week. I made absolutely sure that 25M was aware of the fact that I will not have my evenings free anymore ( = of course we‚Äôll still see each other, but I‚Äôll mostly have to work like crazy for at least two years). I repeated it at the end of last year school year, and during the summer: I cannot just not prepare my classes. If I don‚Äôt, I fail my students and I get fired.

I‚Äôve been in formation for the last 3 days. It ends up towards 17 and I‚Äôm home by 18. The day before was our evening, so we were together the last evening (I didn‚Äôt work that evening because I‚Äôm a lazy fuck, but also because he needed support about something that had activated his trauma during the day). Yesterday was my evening with 26M, who wasn‚Äôt home yet from work. So when I arrived to 26M‚Äô place, I exchanged a few messages with 25M.

Me ‚Äî 18:09 
Hey love! I'm back home but working 
I'm not answering now because I'm in a good working mood and don't want to snap out of it

Him ‚Äî 18:10
Okay! Glad to know you're in a good groove right now ^^

At that point [chatbox] is closed because I don‚Äôt want to be distracted. I sent him a quick message at 19:06 about something I found funny related to my work, that didn‚Äôt really required a long answer. He answered shortly: ¬´¬†heh, now that's funny!¬†¬ª. Then [chatbox] is closed again.

10 mins later (19:16) he lets me know he‚Äôs not available from now cause he‚Äôll be playing a video game with his best friend online. I answer 20 mins later (19:42) when I open up Discord again because I‚Äôm about to have diner: ¬´¬†Oh! Cool! Well, I'm preparing my [discipline] classes about [subject]. I‚Äôm doing okay.¬†¬ª

20:44 he says ¬´¬†Hey dear, I‚Äôm AFK‚Äôing for dinner¬†¬ª
At that point I had just finished diner I just had started to work again, so I didn‚Äôt answer in order not to start procrastinate. [chatbox] is off but my phone is on vibrating mode.

Towards 23 my phone keeps vibrating, so I end up checking it. He sent me a bunch of messages on discord. 

Him, 21:06 ‚Äî  Oh gosh, i got that video about [thing we talked about the day before]

Him, 22:10 ‚Äî  Hey OP? I‚Äôm available whenever you want my dear.

Him, 22:33 ‚Äî Hey, when are we going to call tonight?

Him, 22:59 ‚Äî I‚Äôm going to sleep now, i'm exhausted. I‚Äôm very displeased about your absence. I‚Äôm also feeling worried, I literally have no idea of what's going on.

Me, 23:01 ‚Äî I just saw your messages, I looked at [chatbox] because i felt my phone vibrating a few times. I told you, I'm working. If i'm working, I'm not on [chatbox]. I'm calling you now

Him, 23:02 ‚Äî What, even now?

Me, 23:02 ‚Äî Yes. I‚Äôve done basically nothing for a few weeks, school starts in less than a week, and i told you i was in a working mood.

Then we had a quick phone call that was very bitter, in which I said that I was very unhappy about this situation which felt unfair. 

He said if he had known I was working he wouldn‚Äôt have insisted that much. I answered that I told him I was in a working mood, and I referred twice to me being working. 

He said ¬´¬†You posted something at Xh on Reddit¬†¬ª, to which I answered ¬´¬†If you read what I wrote, it‚Äôs on the [my country] teaching subreddit and the post is a work related question¬†¬ª. 
He said I should have let him know my planning during the evening. I said, harshly I fear, that ¬´¬†Today is not our evening. I don‚Äôt owe your to tell you my planning about an evening that isn‚Äôt ours¬†¬ª. When I said that, I had in mind to firmly enforce boundaries, as in, this time isn‚Äôt dedicated to him except for the moment where we call. 

But then he said I was misinterpretating what he said, that he let me know of his planning all along the evening, and I should have done the same especially since I wasn‚Äôt going to call. I answered ¬´¬†I was going to call you, but you never go to sleep as early as 23:00 and I‚Äôm not prescient, I cannot guess that you‚Äôll feel exhausted tonight and that I had to call sooner. If you want to call me earlier, just call.¬†¬ª

He said he wasn‚Äôt in the mood to pursue the conversation and he hung up. We called again this morning as I was walking to formation, he said he wanted to discuss this further more, but not now because he was off to work.

So here‚Äôs the thing: I really feel like the situation is unfair, I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong and I‚Äôm super irked, he would not like it if 26M required me to tell him what my planning with 25M is. But maybe I was too insensitive? He didn‚Äôt sleep well because of this and I feel guilty. He did tell me about his planning all evening to help me organize for our call. But at the same time I didn‚Äôt ask him to.

I cannot really ask the advice of a friend because all my friends are also 26M‚Äô friends, and compartmentalizing is very important to 25M.

[IN SHORT: My partner is sad because I didn‚Äôt answer his messages. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the wrong because I was working and it was someone else‚Äôs evening, so I don‚Äôt think I owe it to him. Yet I feel guilty of him feeling that way, and I wonder if I wasn‚Äôt too insensitive.]",polyamory,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/pcjpzt/am_i_in_the_wrong_here/,Advice,MenmasThrowaway1010,pcjpzt,/r/polyamory/comments/pcjpzt/am_i_in_the_wrong_here/,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/pcjpzt/am_i_in_the_wrong_here/,8,2021-08-27
No Way Home is proof that the MCU Spider-Man is a failure and the worst Spider-Man,"No Way Home is proof that Disney ruined Spider-Man. While a lot of Disney fangirls like the Iron Boy Jr movies, it's clear that all real Spider-Man fans hate them and see them die the soulless, character-assassinating garbage that they are. The fact that they're bringing back the real Spider-Men and their villains is clearly a desperate attempt to win back the fans they alienated with the last two films. Think about it. Would anyone care about this movie if it was just Iron Boy Jr fighting Kraven (who would probably have been a disgruntled Stark Industries security guard)? Of course not. People only care about this movie because they're sick of Iron Boy Jr and want to see the real Spider-Men again.

I (24F) Am Conflicted If I Was The One That Ruined My Relationship,"I (24F) dated my (30M) boyfriend for around 9 months (his longest relationship) before he broke up with me just over a week ago. Though likely not the best move to be obsessing over why it ended, I can't help but ruminate over the possible things I could've changed.

I should preface, I have pretty severe anxiety (my bf was aware of this from the beginning) and have been seeking professional help for it the last few months.

I should also mention that I believe I have many reasons for why I felt insecure in my relationship that wasn't just from uncontrolled anxiety. At the beginning of our relationship, my bf wasn't too keen on labels that immediately made me question how serious he intended on taking his relationship with me. Over time, he eventually called me his gf. He lives at home, but fully hid me from his family and friends. He snuck me around his house, so I never was properly introduced to his closest circle. I am white and he was Asian, so at first I thought it was the cultural differences. When we went to a Starbucks on one occasion and his sister walked in, he asked me to go back to the car so she wouldn't see us together. Clothed or not, whenever his mother would knock on the door and I was in the room, he would throw a blanket over me like I wasn't there. His family eventually guessed who I was, but he allowed them to think I was a work colleague. It took almost a year for me to be introduced to a friend, and it was only because I mentioned I would like to meet someone close to him. He always accused me of overthinking when I'd express concerns that it was because he didn't see me as long-term material, but I later found out that it was, in fact, the case.

When I asked if he wanted to meet my parents/friends, he declined as it was ""too socially awkward"" for him. It was only when I expressed it was important to me, he considered it. When I asked him at around 6 months in what he wanted from his life in the future (marriage, kids, etc.), he got really stressed out saying I was pressuring him to check off boxes for my own expectations of him?

Every natural step in progressing the relationship felt like walking on glass/pulling teeth for me...

He said I magnified issues, which lead to the breakup. When it came to conflict resolution, we had a mismatch of techniques (I'm anxious, he was avoidant). I always wanted to discuss issues head-on, while he'd need time to process his feelings. I tried to adapt to his needs by giving him time, but I always tried to check in to make sure he was okay. He would never tell me how much time he'd need, and would stonewall me for 7 days at a time, giving me no context for his feelings, which made my anxiety skyrocket. If I expressed that something he said had hurt me, he would shut down and in turn make me feel guilty for my emotions and I would end up apologizing for my feelings. He always said I should bring up my concerns, but I would always end up feeling silly for them. When I would say something he said had hurt me, he would usually reply with: ""You're too sensitive, it was a joke""/ ""You're making issues where there aren't any""/""Guess I won't say anything at all."" It was only when I was break down and helplessly cry would he soften and talk me down. I begged him countless times to communicate more with me or to discuss methods that worked for both of us, and he would just say he did his part, and that ""there's no point in talking about something when I don't think you will change."" I didn't think that was fair to me. I would give him gifts (a love language) to try to cheer him up during these lows, and he accused me of ""having a manipulative agenda to monitor his emotions when I did something wrong."".....I didn't see this as calculated, but rather my attempts at being a supportive partner?

When I confided in my parents about my experiences, they believe I was emotionally abused--does it seem that way?

I am not perfect and definitely wasn't an easy gf by any means, I needed a lot of reassurance. But I loved him with everything I had and would've fought for him until the end. Was I in the wrong throughout all of this?

AITA for sending my son to his mother's house on my custody week?,"I am 52 year old father of a 13 year boy. His mother and I divorced when he was 9 years old.

My son was homeschooled until I began to realize my wife‚Äôs mental health was spiraling and with it any pretense of educating my son. She refused treatment and fell into addiction.

When she started hitting me I mentioned I was going to see a divorce lawyer. She kidnapped my son and disappeared.

When I got him back, he wept that he never was told what was going on. She never told him why I wasn't around, when they were moving, where I was. He was in limbo for months before I could explain to him that I didn't abandon him.

I enrolled him in public school. He could not write in small case letters or even spell his own last name at first. I fought for 50% custody of my son and got it. He improved academically.

During the early day of Covid, he stayed with his mother because my partner was working in an ER. I didn't see him for almost three months. When I got him back he was a surly, angry kid.

When the second wave, he stayed with his mom for another month and a half. Now he is starting a fight with me nearly every week. 

I am a sh\*\*ty father he says. Some of the reasons he accuses me of 'abuse':

1. I try to 'buy his affection' with video games, a console and a computer.

2. I 'rule by fear' when I take his electronics away when he refuses to do his schoolwork and then lies that he did.

3. I don't understand when he is, ""just joking"". (Backpedaling when I put my foot down).

4. I demand than he showers at least once a week, brush his teeth, and trim filthy nails.

5. I made him ride his bike four miles each way to Summer School on days I was working 2nd shift.

6. I do not explain in detail WHY I tell him to do something, every time.

He has come at me pointing a finger in my face. The first time (months ago) I calmly told him to put that finger away or I was going put it somewhere really uncomfortable.

This week he again shoved his finger in my face. I was furious and I needed to deescalate for my own good. I started to head for the stairs to go to my bedroom and cool off.

That's when my 13 old year old son decided to tell me in a haughty, parental tone, ""That's right. Go to your room!""

It was a last straw. I confronted him with the fact that as a child he had NO right to every order me around. Especially in my own house.

He sat down while telling me how there is no good reason a Parent should be allowed to tell their Child to do anything without explaining it and getting acceptance of it from the child first.

I simply looked at him and said, ""Go to your room"".

""Why? I am eating.""

""Take the bowl with you.""

""No. There is no good reason for me to.""

I called his mother. I explained she needed to come pick him up if he refuses obey the rules of my house.

He was shocked. Then furious. Tried to talk me out of it. Even started going to his room. I held firm.

So am I the asshole for sending him home to his mother on my custody week?

Becoming a Realtor: What‚Äôs the Point of Open Houses?," 

Most people think that the point of an open house is to sell the house at which you‚Äôre holding said open house! BEEEEEP. Wrong. Here‚Äôs the rundown of open houses, especially as a newer agent.

Yes, yes, yes, of course it would be fantastic to have someone walk into the open house, fall in love with the property, and say they want to put an offer in on that particular house. This is of course important if you‚Äôre the actual listing agent. However, there are much bigger and better things to focus on during an open house‚Ä¶ the main one being new leads!

As a new agent, you‚Äôll hear time and time again from seasoned Realtors that you should be hosting open houses all the time. Spoiler alert: you can do this without your own listings! Contact other agents in your area and ask them about their listing and if you can hold an open house for them. It will probably take quite a few phone calls, and many rejections, but you will be able to get some if you put in enough work. Then - host an awesome open house! 

Promote and advertise the open house to the extent you would if it were your own listing. Double check with the listing agent that the open house is listed in the MLS, that way it also shows up on sites like Zillow. Grab some snacks for attendees, all of your signs, your business cards, and a sign in sheet! Do not forget the sign in sheet‚Ä¶ no one wants to tell you their info while you type it out on your phone. Have a sheet ready to go to collect contact info of everyone who comes in the door. Also make sure to ask if they are already working with a Realtor. 

At the open house‚Ä¶ talk with people! Get to know everyone who comes in the door. What‚Äôs their story? How long have they been looking? What are their needs in their new home? If they don‚Äôt have a Realtor, let them know you will send them other homes to check out and are available if they want to see them in person. This is a huge way to get leads and clients as a new agent - take advantage of it!

Most importantly, however, is after the open house. You have to follow up! And do it consistently. People will forget‚Ä¶ make sure you don‚Äôt!",BecomeRealEstateAgent,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BecomeRealEstateAgent/comments/pcshbm/becoming_a_realtor_whats_the_point_of_open_houses/,,devinjrobinson,pcshbm,/r/BecomeRealEstateAgent/comments/pcshbm/becoming_a_realtor_whats_the_point_of_open_houses/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BecomeRealEstateAgent/comments/pcshbm/becoming_a_realtor_whats_the_point_of_open_houses/,1,2021-08-27
I(27F) feel like my polyamorous partners (26m and 31m) take me for granted and treat me differently than others in our circle and im at a loss on how to articulate my thoughts.,"So context I am dating both of them, they are dating eachother, and there are a few other ""partners"" I use the term loosely because its LDR and in the case of them both one of the people they called a partner who only viewed them as a friend. Also the one is asexual and only really wants kissing and handholding. The two of them live together and I visit once a week and spend about 12 hours over there. 

Idk how to explain it but I know all relationships are different and that you will do different things with different people. But we all share lots of common interests and I feel that I get different treatment because they see me in person and idk how to explain things in a manner that will make them understand im unhappy with this treatment.

However the ""partners"" of 31 do apparently share common interests such as text based role playing from our favorite shows and games over discord. Like the other day we were having a movie night and I watched him carrying on multiple texts based RP's with people who i know yet getting him to reply to or take interests in the stuff we have going on is like pulling teeth, and I'm frequently left hanging ""because he has no inspiration"" while I see him talking to these people.

When I stay the night, which is usually once a month normally I sleep in a chair and ottoman crammed into the ones bedroom.  And every week when I show up to even hang out the chair is always full of things like their clothing and food. ( Long story short they live with 26'd bro and he's a food thief so their stuff is in their rooms). I come over on the same day each week so its not like suprise, and he claims he was busy/tired ect.

Now due to issues 26's Bro is moving out of their condo (in about 2 weeks) and 31 has a friend (just a friend not a partner) who's close in age and was living in a crappy situation and had to either be homeless or move back in with abusive parents.  This person had previously stayed with them for several months I encourage them to move them in for money reasons and once the bro was gone they'd have their own space once we cleaned it out.

 Before this person arrives 31 decides that they have to detail clean the kitchen (they eat a lot of microwave meals and fast food) and take all of the kitchen utensils that they didn't want 26's brother to break that I bought them because they didn't have much and put them in the kitchen.  Before this person's arrival the 2 of them spent a lot of time and effort deep cleaning their place and 31's bedroom. I helped and put in just as much effort as them.  And while realistically I understand that they had to make space for this person and their personal effects, they didn't want to do any of this when it was just me hanging out over there.  And I would have understood a bit better if they moved all the stuff too 26's room until the brother left.

I wound up agreeing to go pick up the friend with them they came via train and it was a sketchy part of town it was easily a 1.5 to 2 hour drive. 31 decided to pack their friend a lunchbox to eat in my car on the way home. I have a specific food allergy and 31 makes them a drink containing my allergin and I said nothing, because as long as I wasn't touching or drinking it I should be fine as it wasn't a potent smelling thing.  We arrive and pick up the friend, The friend had 2 large bags and a Box 31 gets out to help them and 26 tries to as well I told him not to because a) he is currently injured and b) I didn't want to be alone in the car sketchy part of town. The friend ends up falling over and he busts out of the car to help which upset me because I was left alone granted it was only 30ish feet away. I didn't get a sorry or thank you for driving nor repayment of gas.

TLDR: my partners seem to put less effort into me when it comes to doing things with others in our circle and idk how to convey that feeling in a manner that they'll understand and not tell me ""well I get to see you in person so its different""",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcrnxp/i27f_feel_like_my_polyamorous_partners_26m_and/,,Julchen_ze_Prussian,pcrnxp,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcrnxp/i27f_feel_like_my_polyamorous_partners_26m_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcrnxp/i27f_feel_like_my_polyamorous_partners_26m_and/,4,2021-08-27
My 8 year old son left me a note,"As a mum I try to hide my alcoholism from him, thinking it may protect him in some way. We are in lockdown here and today I went to pick up my daughters. When I came home he just said ""I know"". I had a suspicion but asked what he knew. He said look in your wardrobe (where I hide my wine). Next to the bottle was a little note saying ""I know"".

I went to him and told him I am so sorry he found this and that it is something I am very ashamed about and trying to change so that I can be a better parent to him. I told him that I have a problem with alcohol but that I am trying very hard to change that. He said ""perhaps we can keep this between ourselves"". I said No, your Dad knows about it, and if there are any questions you want to know or any feelings you need to talk about it is best to talk about them with either me, Dad, or someone else you trust.

I feel terrible. I think I am scarring my children forever with my alcoholism and I don't want it to be this way but I can't seem to string more than 4 days sober together. In every other aspect of my life I am successful but this is a horrible weight around my neck. I've tried psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoanalysis, drugs including naltrexone, baclofen, Zyban, Vyvanse, agomelatine but nothing seems to stick.

I found some helpful inspiration for decorating my house (HARD) from a fellow ADHD-haver,"Ok, I'm in my thirties, finally trying to decorate my house and make it feel good - I want a home that I love being in. It's been a real challenge because my partner and I both have ADHD and lots of different wants for our house. In addition, a lot of interior design comes from a NT place and focuses on creating a consistent mood in the house, which I find doesn't provide enough variance to be stimulating. 

Here are some of the things I've been grappling with: 

-  I want it to be creatively stimulating and inspiring so that I am motivated to make things rather than easily distracted by the television so just having a ""tasteful"" couch and rug isn't gonna cut it.

- My partner wants it to feel pulled together enough to entertain but also unique

- I want it to feel like an authentic expression of myself, not a regurgitation of trends.

- I want it to encourage play because that makes both of us really happy

- I want it to encourage movement because I love being home and movement is so good for ADHD

I came across [Cara Delevingne's AD house tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx09_4cEzlM) earlier this week and it blew my mind - it was the first house tour that felt like it was working along those lines. No surprise: she has ADHD. 

I don't have Cara Delevingne money (...yet) - but I'm an ace thrifter and I know you don't need a lot of money to create a space you like. I appreciate the way she's been able to incorporate different themes into her house. Here are some of the things I've taken note of for my own house design project:

- Pick two colors to be a consistent color theme throughout the house and make sure you have elements of that in each room

- Create opportunities for movement

- Embrace your ""crazy"" ideas

- Invite your guests to play

- Dedicate space for the things you love

- Vary your sensory stuff - lights and textures, encourage interaction with your space

- Select objects for your space that encourage interaction

- Select objects that have personal meaning for you

- Have open space

- Design it to fit you rather than force yourself to fit a design",ADHD,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pcsz7u/i_found_some_helpful_inspiration_for_decorating/,Tips/Suggestions,UnicornBestFriend,pcsz7u,/r/ADHD/comments/pcsz7u/i_found_some_helpful_inspiration_for_decorating/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pcsz7u/i_found_some_helpful_inspiration_for_decorating/,2,2021-08-27
Husband caught cheating after 11 years together,"I have a super messy history with my husband, including his substance and drug abuse which was really bad at one point but got better. We have three kids together (11, 3 and 5 months). A year and a half ago my husband lied to me about using cocaine, I told him he needed to move out but he wouldn't take me seriously. So to put up with living with him I started to talk to multiple men online I guess to feel acknowledged, get attention I was deprived of, and just to feel wanted in that way. It wasn't serious, just flirting but my husband found out and hit me. Police were called and he was told to leave and not come back. I felt relieved he was gone and started to enjoy life with my two boys as a single mom. Then he crept back into my life slowly saying he wanted to see the kids, showing how well he was doing and he seemed to be getting his shit together. So after 8 months we started to try again. My kids adore their dad and I felt wrong taking them away from him, not a good reason to get back together, I see this now. Anyways, 2 months pass and we find out I'm pregnant with baby #3, a baby girl. Everything was fine, he wanted things to work despite my mistake before and things were great. Slowly he started bringing up what I had done the previous year and would say rude things to me here and there about it. I kept telling him if he bothered him why try to ""win me over"" and get back together if he hated me and couldn't get over what happened. I told him we need therapy to work through it all but no, the comments kept coming. A few months after our daughter was born it got so bad. We were doing last minute shopping the day before we were all going to the cottage with some family friends, he lost it and was verbally abusive in front of our kids and was acting crazy in walmart. When we got home it kept getting worse so I packed the last of the cottage stuff, plus my stuff, we left at 12am, me and my three kids running to my dads house to get away from his craziness. The following day I told our friends what had happened and told them we weren't comfortable with my husband coming so we went by ourselves. He was extremely upset just as he was the previous day and went crazy again. We left and did our own thing and he stayed behind in the city alone. 
Cut to last week, about a month later, I find out that he cheated me on the day/night we left him behind to go to the cottage. He said he got drunk and went downtown and some woman approached him in the park and asked if he wanted sex to which he said yes. He said he doesn't remember what happened filly because he was drunk but i don't really believe his story or that he doesn't remember. He only confessed to me that he cheated because a few days after we got back from the cottage my lady parts hurt so badly and it felt like I had an infection, low and behold I had gonorrhea given to me by my cheating husband who caught it from ""the woman he fucked in the park"". I'm so mad at him for what he did I don't think I could ever forgive him but I'm so torn on what I should do. If I should make him leave us again once and for all or try to make it work. He's now the perfect husband treating us all soo well but I know its only because he got caught. I'm not sure if what he says is all lies or making this mistake made him realize he doesn't want to lose us. Having three kids is really hard for me, especially the baby but my husband is so good with her and I love being able to hand her off to him if I need to get something done or deal with the other kids. She's only 5 months old so I know it will get easier once she's bigger but that won't be for at least a year or more. I don't want to do this alone, I don't want to have three kids by myself or be a single mom but my desires to have a ""normal"" Family are ruined because of him and nothing can change that. I could never imagine being intimate with him again or having a relationship and that breaks my heart that it's gone. I feel bad too because he says he did it because he wanted to get even with me for my mistake but I never had intercourse with anyone else in our 11 year relationship. I just don't know if I should just let him go or try. I feel so depressed and drained and that I'm failing my kids being so consumed with this. I'm dying to know the truth of what really happened but he will never be honest, he's a pathological liar. I just don't know what's more important, my kids having their dad around or not having a bad influence around. My youngest son lovessssss him so much and would choose him over me, maybe it's a phase or not but I know they'd he heartbroken and i never wanted my kids to be affected by divorce. I don't know what to do, I'm so broken and lost.",breakingmom,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/pccapm/husband_caught_cheating_after_11_years_together/,emotional rollercoaster üé¢,anonanon959697,pccapm,/r/breakingmom/comments/pccapm/husband_caught_cheating_after_11_years_together/,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/pccapm/husband_caught_cheating_after_11_years_together/,42,2021-08-27

I am not sure that I love her,"I am in my mid 30's and my gf (yes... Gf) is 2 years older than me.
We met a few month pre pandemic. 

Me and my family tend to have major conflicts over dumb things. 
A family member was coming out from the hospital, they needed and I wasn't in my right place of mind to give peace to said family member, so I decided to leave until the family member fully recovered. 

She liked the idea of me staying in her apartment for as long as I needed. 
We weren't serious back then, we did talk about our most inner scars and how people have hurt us and so on... Things you don't tell just anyone. 

Since the beginning I felt attached emotionally to her because I felt related in many things about life that we didn't like, we understood each other and we still do.

When we started dating she was on a relationship with another woman, and tbh, she was being treated very VERY bad, so I do not blame her at all for what was happening... Hell not even her ex has said a single word... That's how bad she treated her. 



Prior to her, in all my relationships I ravaged them with kisses and fondling and it was mutual, I felt very attracted to them... But, this is not the case in this relationship, it is more of an emotional connection... It's all about emotional connection and nothing at all about physical attraction, we still have needs... Though she was happy arousing me other ways... If you catch my drift and I didn't mind.

After a while of moving in, few weeks, the pandemic struck... And well panic ensued, we didn't want to see our parents so that we wouldn't hurt them. I enjoyed those times a lot, I really did. I felt like every day was Saturday with her. 

She is a really good person, one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to meet... Not only that, she has cleared a lot of the fog I had on my mind and I was able to think about the things I lack in life and to ponder about my insecurities, to make peace with the wrong doings and to find courage and anger within me rather than submission and false arrogance.

Not long ago my parents were vaccinated, we both lost out jobs and she is living with her parents and I am living with mine.
My parents do not like her... AT ALL, I can't say this is a non factor but definitely not the main decider on how I feel. But they do try really hard to set us apart. 

Once they stated that either I stop talking to her or I should simply leave the house l. I refused and said I would leave the house then, they asked if I was moving in with her and told them things are different and I do not know where I will go. My parents ended up retracting and that I should come back home... However they still think we have to talk about this. 

They don't think she makes make a good effort in life and that she doesn't make an effort either, and well she has bad parents, just like I do. That's why we are compatible. 

My parents aren't bad people, they are just old fashioned people that were very successful in life and believe the way to help someone is to make them do things exactly how they think it should be... Some of you already have an idea of the mental health issues this brings... And I feel I am lucky I even became aware in the first place, there are some that may never wake up from that dreadful nightmare. They are not bad people, they are bad parents. 

Nowadays that we are apart she feels this and she is constantly making me feel pressured, questioning me if I love her, that I should just end it and I simply freeze, don't know what to do and just remain silent... I do not have the guts to tell her it's over for some reasons:

I feel like I owe her...
I feel like if I stop seeing her my mental health will come crashing down once again.... I already feel it since we are apart.
I don't want to hurt her. 
I do not feel physically attracted to her
I thought I didn't want kids, I am not sure anymore but definitely can not have kids anytime soon and she has 2 more years before turning 40. 
I think I will ruin her life if I do so. 


I do not want her to be miserable, if someone who listened very well about my dilemma told me, well boy, just man up and save her like she saved you... Then I would stay with her until I die because I feel so guilty to think about ending it all.


Thanks for reading

Tl;dr after 2 years of relationship, I know that I am no physically attracted to her even though we have had very good days together and its weighin in our relationship.

Finally watched the Sopranos for the first time,"And what is there to be said that hasn‚Äôt already? For the last month I‚Äôve been binging the show and trying my ass off to look up the cast and keep engaged throughout the day when I‚Äôm bored but try my ass off not to spoil anything and I think I did pretty good.

I mean good lord man this show has a fandom the only the best show ever for over 20 years could have. I mean I‚Äôve been calling breaking bad my favorite show for a while now but this shit ties it if not overtakes it.

I abstain from watching this for a while because I thought that it would be too old to watch to enjoy. I usually like things that are set in my current day. But watching it took me back to my youth. I was 11 years old when the show came out by the time it goes off I am 19. And it really shows that part of my life in the cultural stuff. And I could go on and on and on and maybe if this post gets any traction I definitely will write essays for comments but for now all I can really think of or say is


What in the goddamn fuck is up with that last thing? I knew it was coming. I knew that Tony was going to sit down with his family during the last scene and it was going to fade to black. But I had no idea how they were going to get there and that‚Äôs what I was watching the show to be excited for was just knowing that even though I know the last scene I don‚Äôt know how they get there I can still have fun. And dammit I did.

I mean have they had another fucking song build up and up and up that way with the tension and all of the shit going on in around in the damn shell so far? What the fuck? As soon as he gets to the door? What the fuck? Holy shit. I need to go to fucking bed. I‚Äôm not going to fucking bed. I‚Äôm up now. Holy fucking shit. I mean wow. Like that‚Äôs like the fucking craziest shit. I mean I get that I knew it was going to happen but dammit. Dammit. There‚Äôs so much left. Is Tony going to jail? Is AJ going to continue to be a douche bag? Is Tony going to go back to therapy ever? Why didn‚Äôt Dr. Melfi tell him that she was raped? Like what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck

IS SIL OK?!?

Man. Dammit. This is what happens. I watch a great show and then I‚Äôm up all night because I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Dammit. Dammit. Dammit. This show was so damn good. Dammit. What am I gonna do now? It‚Äôs too soon to rewatch it. Dammit. Dammit.

At least the movie is coming out soon so that‚Äôs cool I know I can read all the articles without worrying about being spoiled. But there‚Äôs nothing as nice as knowing I‚Äôm coming home to watch the Sopranos. Shit. I got a find something else to watch.

Dead ass serious, the last time I finished a great show once I got done with it I just went and hung out on the streets for a while. And I probably will now too. Because real life is fucking boring when you‚Äôre just sitting at home watching YouTube videos of wrestling commentary and politics. The Sopranos was the best getaway I‚Äôve had for a while. Dammit. Dammit.

Need some help deciding on which living situation to put myself in college,"So, I'm a 24M moving off to college for the first time after knocking out the first two years a CC.       
      
I've got two lease options on the table at the moment. One is a 5 bedroom, 3 full bath townhome that gets random roommates placed in it. Currently it'd be only three of us and only will fill up further if other people need to be placed. I've spoken with one of the guys and seem to get along with him. It's about a 15 minute walk from campus, 25 from my furthest class.      
        
The other is a two bed, one bath apartment. I don't see myself becoming great friends with the guy but I also don't expect to hate him at all. He will graduate this year, so I'll be in the market for a new roommate in 10 months either way. It's nicer quality, but obviously smaller. It's 10 minutes from campus, 15 to my further class.       
      
I'm really not sure what to do, I need to sign one of them tonight to be moved in by the end of the weekend.     
      
I'm also nervous about making friends, and having people to spend time with. I've lived at home, and around a large family my whole life, being off on my own with no one I'm comfortable with is stressful.

Lauren gray gets seduced by older pervs in a game of truth and dare in front of her bf,"
&amp;#x200B;

[lauren](https://i.redd.it/l06l9xown0x61.jpg)

My character would be innocent a little bitchy, and spoilt use to the rich side of life, I wouldn‚Äôt see what you two are doing as trying to seduce me until maybe it‚Äôs too late x I‚Äôd be playing as the actual celeb x

looking for some to play as my bf he‚Äôd be attractive in decent shape but just a bit of a weak man compared to the confident older men who know and will get what they want and two much older homeless/poor hitchhikers who would be aged 50-70 married with children. Maybe they brag about cheating during the game telling us how they always sleep with much younger sexy girls behind they‚Äôre wife‚Äôs back

Scene: the scene would start with me and my bf that had just come back from an expensive meal, when we see two older homeless on the side of the road being nice my bf pulls over in our brand new luxary car and offers you two a ride to the hotel car park

We‚Äôd get to the hotel us thinks that‚Äôs are good deed over but when you two start saying how you‚Äôre homeless and go no where to stay my bf offers you two the sofa in our penthouse for the night‚Ä¶you of course agree this all part of the plan to get your hands on his gf

Maybe we get to the elevator the penthouse on the top floor you stopping my bf as he goes to walk in telling him there is not enough room and he better get the stairs (just to show the power you two have) the rides awkward as you two squeeze close to my young perfect body

We get to our penthouse on the top floor that we paid for early it being massive and fit for a king and queen you two immediately make yourself at home almost like you‚Äôve planned this you‚Äôd have a way to talk to each other through text or whispearing in Oder to seduce me.

You see, my bfs and mine expensive jewellery worth thousands but you two wanting more than just money or jewellery that‚Äôs just a bonus the main prize was sitting front of you and you‚Äôd have to work had to get her

You two suggest a game of truth and dare, to which we accept thinking it maybe fun, but not knowing you two have done this sort of thing to loads of young couples in the past‚Ä¶tho your first time with a major celeb like myself, the game would start off like any normal game of truth and dare innocent but you two plan to change that asking more dirty questions and getting me and doing things to me that are questionable to say the least x

Maybe you lie and say your children are a big fan of me and get some pics of you two holding my waist tightly as we smile for the innocent picture

Endless possibilities here I‚Äôd love to discuss in more depth xx feel free to send me a message can‚Äôt wait to hear from you x

The slower and more foreplay with this scene the better xx I love original dares/ truths not just strip that‚Äôs dull x

Kinks; hairpulling, slapping, degrading, dirty talk, teasing, stealing, age gap, rough, bareback, cheating, secret sex, whispearing, groping, slow seduction, kissing, dares/truths, praise kink

Stuck in a Bad Family Situation with Seemingly No Way Out.,"Pretext:   
I am a 26 Year Old, white, transgender (Male to Androgyne or Female)fellow, with Autism Spectrum Disorder (Previously known as Asperger's Syndrome), a High School Education, some College Education, no Work Experience, and a love for computers/gaming. I am also a Christian by faith, but that does not tie into any of this. I rely on a monthly stipend from the US Government for basic survival needs (Social Security Disability Income), to the tune of $780 US Dollars/mo. I am also frail, with an unknown joint disease (non-arthritic), that makes walking long distances, or remaining on my feet for any extended period of time incredibly painful. To put it shortly, my joints in my hips, knees, and ankles feel like they're on fire after walking short distances.

The Setup:  
I roommate with my Aunt (50) (Blood Relative) and Uncle (49) (By Marriage). We share a Rent House valued at $1200/mo. My Aunt is a bedbound (unconfirmed medically, she hasn't seen a Dr. in years) woman who weighs \~600 US Pounds (\~290KG). She is totally incable of walking on her own. My Uncle works at a Grocery Store in the next City over (20 Miles), at slightly more than minimum wage ($12/HR). He is a narcissist of sorts, who cares only for himself, and barely even at that. He goes entire months without bathing, &gt;!doesn't wipe his own rear-end after defacating!&lt;, has a general entitled attitude (both do, really), and has very poor temperment. They have been married for 20 years, but constantly fight. I'm fairly sure that the only reason they're still together is necessity. She handles money because he can't do simple maths.  


The Situation:   
On top of paying a great chunk of my monthly income to continue living here, I am constantly taken advantage of. I am forced to be an unpaid caregiver for my Aunt. But not only that, but *entirely on her own schedule.* She needs to use the bathroom at 4AM (04:00)? I'm expected to be right there, in short notice. She calls me over Facebook Messenger instead of calling my name, because I'm somewhat hard of hearing. Messenger phone calls are louder than my standard ringtone, so I'm inevitably startled out of bed due to it. If I am not there within 5 minutes of receiving one of such calls, she starts screeching profanities at me at the top of her lungs. It usually takes me a moment (around 3 minutes) to get myself up out of my ""bed""&gt;! (a matt of couch cushions flat on the floor with a sheet thrown over them; I've been so strapped for cash since I moved in here that I've never been able to afford a real bed. Or even mattress) !&lt;, and get myself oriented well enough to go deal with her issues. The same with cooking and drink. I am expected, no matter what I happen to be doing, to drop everything and go cook/mix drinks for her. And I have any hesitation whatsoever, I get berated and talked down to over it.  


A Side-Note: 

I make grocery money from my Computer/Gaming hobby. I am a freelance 3D artist, who creates Videogame Modifications (""Mods"", effectively creating new content for games, rather than ""Hacking"" or Cheating) for views/downloads/donations/commissions. Mainly Commissions. &gt;!Horny furries that want to see their Original Characters in VR Chat/Garry's Mod.!&lt; I also do photography/image touch-ups/Photoshop Jobs. Me being late on a project means that I'm losing money. Money that I use to literally pay for food.  


The Breaking Point: 

My car's Registration came due for renewal in March of 2020. (Was a gift from a friend.) I took my car to a shop that does free diagnostics, and found that it needs several thousand dollars worth of work to get to the point that it could pass state emissions testing. I attempted to get the two onboard to helping me pool money for the repairs, and they couldn't be bothered. So I gave up and continued driving it, knowing that I could get in trouble, but that due to my situation I might get leniency if something did go wrong. I carried my Uncle back and forth to his job for months. Then came complacency. And it bit my tail.

 

I managed to squeeze by until June on this year (2021) without any encounters of the Cop Kind. Then my luck totally changed. I was ticketed for Expired Registration. Went to court over it, and had the law book thrown at me. $140. I was floored. I literally had $20 to my name, and didn't make enough to even meet a payment plan. I was given 2 days to come up with a solution, or to come back and I would serve it out in Jail (They wouldn't do Community Service due to me being disabled). So I sent a text to my Bible Study group asking for a Prayer Request, and one of them texted me privately that they would pay my ticket off. I managed to get them to drive me to the Courthouse of the town that wrote the ticket (30 Miles away), and all was well. Until exactly a month later. Aunt created an order for Pizza, but was too cheap to pay the $5 for delivery, so she sweet-talked me into driving my totally illegal car .5 Mile to go pick it up. The way this Pizza restaurant was, I had to pull into the outer (right-hand) lane to be lined up with the intersection that I needed to turn onto to get home. An Officer was watching from an empty lot about 200 Meters from the exit, but on the other side of the road. They (2 officers, one male, one female) promptly proceed to pull me over, citing me for an ""Illegal Turn"". I explained that I needed to turn at the next intersection, and he dropped that charge. But said that ""I have to charge you for the expired registration"". So yay. I am due to return to court, but in my hometown, on the 10th. But this isn't even the tip of the iceberg. It's shitty that she would knowingly force me to drive, and possibly get ticketed. But there's worse.

&amp;#x200B;

I Don't Care Anymore:

Living with the constant stress of dealing with them is literally taking a toll on me. I have a mental breakdown at least once a week. I've put on a significant amount of mass since I moved in here. She has pushed my longtime friend away from me with her incessant ""Errand Running""... He couldn't even visit my house without her wanting something from him. And I don't blame him. She's an entitled person who wants the world to bow to her. Below is a transcript of a conversation I had with her yesterday: (Originally posted in my Discord Channel)**(Profanity alert)**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Her:Summons me into her room by screeching my name.!&lt;

&gt;!Me:Enters room.!&lt;

&gt;!Her:I need you to put your fucking games down and cook me some goddamned food!!&lt;

&gt;!Me:&lt;in as calm of a voice as possible&gt; Okay then. What do you want?!&lt;

&gt;!Her:Wipe that smirk off your face! &lt;as I was apparently smiling subconsciously &gt;!&lt;

&gt;!I want you to cook some &lt;Insert long preparation time food&gt;!!&lt;

&gt;!Me:Do you have anything that might be a little bit quicker to cook? I'm in the final stages of &lt;she cuts me off mid sentence&gt;!&lt;

&gt;!Her:Why are you always so fucking busy? Would it really hurt your &lt;in very sarcastic tone&gt;""Busy Schedule"" so much to stop and make me some motherfucking food?!&lt;

&gt;!Me:At this very moment, yes it would. I am trying to &lt;cuts me off again violently&gt;!&lt;

&gt;!Her:Why so much attitude? God, you millennials are so entitled! You should do what I want, when I want it. I'm your elder!!&lt;

&gt;!Me:&lt;Bites my tongue not to lay into her&gt;!&lt;

&gt;!Her:Aren't you going to say something? God, you're so rude! You need to find somewhere else to live!!&lt;

&gt;!Me:&lt;Under my breath&gt;If only...!&lt;

&gt;!Her:What did you fucking say?? Get the fuck out of my room!!&lt;

&gt;!Me:&lt;exits room without saying a word, making sure not to slam it&gt;!&lt;

&gt;!\[1:33 PM\]!&lt;

&gt;!Literally where I've been the past 20 minutes. I've got to find a way out of this constant shit.!&lt;

&gt;!\[1:34 PM\]!&lt;

&gt;!Also, worth noting: I am responsible for 1/3 of the rent bill, the whole water bill, and the whole electrical bill!&lt;

&gt;!\[1:34 PM\]!&lt;

&gt;!How am I being entitled here?!&lt;

&gt;!\[1:36 PM\]!&lt;

&gt;!\[Names Redacted\] If you guys have any advice, please give what you've got. I'm on the edge of mental breakdown on a daily basis at this point.!&lt;

&gt;!\[1:40 PM\]!&lt;

&gt;!Been living like this for 4 years now, and I've long since had way too much.!&lt;

&gt;!\[1:41 PM\]!&lt;

&gt;!Or am I actually the problem here?!&lt;  


Side Note: Modding is not only my hobby, but serves as a strong antidepressant. When I have to deal with bad situations and can't turn my mind to creativity, I get overwhelmed emotionally.  


The Moving-Out Dilemma: I do not make enough money monthly to afford an apartment of my own, in this area. I live in an Oil producing area, and most of the general public is quite well off from it. Housing is expensive. A ""cheap"" 1 Bedroom is \~970/Mo. This 2 Bedroom Renthouse is in very poor shape and still goes for $1200/mo. There are outlets/switches with exposed wiring. Only 2 outlets in the kitchen work. It's infested by cockroaches. The Air Conditioner totally cut out 4 months after moving in, and the Landlord's too big of a cheapskate to replace it, but won't allow me to put in a window unit. (Not like I could even afford it, though). It gets to 110\* F here in the summertime, and not having A/C has been Hell.

&amp;#x200B;

The Repercussions:

I am the only reason they are able to afford living here. I would be leaving an entirely dependent woman to the whims of her husband, who can't even be bothered to keep up with his own self. I've been told point-blank that if I leave, I will never be welcome in their house again. They would have to move out, and find somewhere cheaper to live. Which with them having 2 evictions prior, is not a good look. The Uncle would be entirely responsible for packing them up, and I'm the only one in the family with a Driver's License. Inversely, not being able to drive, I'm having trouble keeping up with my hygiene; this house doesn't have laundry. I haven't had clean clothes in 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of all of this, I don't know how to feel. I have anger, sorrow, and pity all at once. But the fact that she ate herself to that weight kinda snaps me back to reality a bit. She willingly gorged herself. I have the same genetics as her, and have been maintaining a weight that is not obese. She just didn't care. Or worse, used it as a ploy to force others to take care of her.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I've got. I'm in a very bad situation, and I fear if nothing changes, I will end up on the Suicide Hotline.

35 [M4A] #NYC - Hung MWM Looking for Ongoing Discreet Oral Servicing Partner,"Please read to the end before messaging me!

I'm looking to establish something ongoing with someone *nearby* in wburg brooklyn who can host and would enjoy giving me sloppy deepthroat head regularly. Largely preferential to either women or someone fem or androgynous presenting, but am open to hearing from others.  I'm only interested in someone who wants to be on-call relief for just one person, so it would be great to meet someone similarly selective who's way outside any kind of hookup scene and, like me, secretly harbors this fantasy but hasn‚Äôt acted on it in awhile (or ever). This one's for the wallflowers who think this whole online hookup thing is a little scary, but are sitting at home drooling over the RAOBJ posts and fantasizing about having one thick, straight cock and heavy balls that they can feel safe taking care of.

I'm 5'10"", masculine, hung thick BWC, athletic body, handsome face, chill, kind, clean, vaccinated, discreet, and always in the mood. Like...*always*. I'm not looking for a lot of conversation unless we really hit it off, but I do want to find a nice, friendly, soft-spoken person with relaxed energy to create an easy, no-drama vibe with who can keep me drained.  I'm more into kicking back and enjoying, but can be dominant and more active if that's what you're into. Either way, I'm very into mutual respect and making sure you feel comfortable and am fine being discreet if you're also married or have a gf/bf.

Please, please only message me if: you either live alone or at least can host easily and frequently without roommates around in Williamsburg (Bedford, Lorimer, or Graham L or Marcy M) or maybe Greenpoint, keep a smooth face with no facial hair, are around my height or shorter, and are under 40. Bonus points for being WFH/available M-F during the day, but not a dealbreaker if you aren't.

My gf(29) of 2 years has decided to end our relationship,"My(22) gf and I have been going out for two years. We have had a strong stable relationship for most of it, but we had a few big issues.

1) The age gap. She wants to get married and have kids before 32. I am not opposed, but it is hard for me because I am about to start my career in the army and I am basically broke. I love her and want to marry her but I know she wants a nice ring and a decently sized wedding that I feel that I cannot fund anytime soon. She is a teacher and still relatively fresh in her career and does not have much savings. 2) Family. Long story short my mom dislikes my gf to the point where she has banned her from entering our home. My gf's brother also has expressed that he thinks that I am not a good person and that he does not change his opinion. I feel that these issues are something we can slowly ""fix"", but is understandably traumatized as my mom cursed her out, branded her a liar, and mistreated her. My gf has expressed that she cannot even look at my mom's face.

3) Career. My job in the army means that I will be relocated probably overseas. We were both concerned about how this would affect our relationship. She said she would drop her teaching job and teach wherever I ended up. I thought it would be okay for us to do long distance for a while until I got stationed in the US. I was also not opposed to living together.

4) Communication. Oftentimes she does not understand my sarcastic jokes no matter how many time I tell her I'm not serious. I know I should stop speaking that way to her, but it has become a part of who I am. I am still in the process of learning where to sacrifice and compromise her needs. She does not seem to understand me as a person.

Overall, these issue persisted in our relationship early on and got more stressful overtime. We broke up 2 times before this time because a mixture of these issues, mostly the communication aspect. I love her and I wanna marry her, but she finally broke up with me for the last time because she was emotionally drained and didn't have the strength to persevere through our challenges. She has other personal issues stemming from her child so I want to give her time and space that she asked for, but I also don't want to let her go.

The advice I'm looking for is if I should move on (This is my first relationship) or if I should just hope and wait for her. Is there anything I didn't consider?

I apologize if this was hard to understand.",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcuflq/my_gf29_of_2_years_has_decided_to_end_our/,,weirdfile,pcuflq,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcuflq/my_gf29_of_2_years_has_decided_to_end_our/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pcuflq/my_gf29_of_2_years_has_decided_to_end_our/,9,2021-08-27

Tier 2 Tools and Tier 3 Mint Mace in 2/3 Days In-Game Time GUIDE,"Recently I've been perfecting a route within the backyard i can take upon starting a new game to allow me to maximize not only raw science but get the higher tier 2 tools in my hands early game to not miss any Crow Feathers, Mints or BBQ chunks and to get them on respawn ASAP when entering a map. I've managed to get the tier 2 Axe and Mallet (busting tool) and the Tier 3 Mint Club. All by day 2/3 in game, basically jumping over some tier 1 tools and going straight to the tier 2. I also have managed to do it WITHOUT a player made Workbench all while completing the 3 BurgL quests each day. Retrieved all BurgL chips by Day 4 and have completed the pond lab and hedge lab. Figured id attempt to try put some of my run info into a post for others to read in case they wanna try levelling up tools faster as well. Been doing my runs on Mild &amp; Medium only.  


* Only Analyse Plant Fibre when entering a map, just pickup a Pebblet, Sprig and Sap, don't scan any of them, only Plant Fibre. Once you have scanned that you'll unlock Crude Rope, crafting 1 Crude Rope should unlock all Tier 1 Tools allowing you to craft any tools you may need to complete the [Mysterious Machine](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Mysterious_Machine). Make sure to grab the Granola Bars. By this point you should have discovered the [Baseball](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Baseball) location, 1st Field Station &amp; [Mysterious Machine](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Mysterious_Machine). When doing the cable for the Machine, don't worry about the SCAB or the Quartzite, it'll only fill your backpack up and you wont need it straight away, can come back later and grab them. Your doing this to wait on BurgL to give you analyse quests as he offers a lot more Raw Science for scanning things then you just doing it yourself. Personally i just craft a tier 1 axe to chop the grass plank down, that will get me by until i need a weapon later. Can also path straight to the Cable and deal with the Mites with a rock or fists before going past the Baseball to the Field Station.  


As soon as I've completed the [Mysterious Machine](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Mysterious_Machine) all Raw Science should spawn across your map. Cut down the Dandelion next to the Machine (towards the Ant Hill), pickup 1 weed stem to unlock the builds and grab a Tuft for a parachute. Don't forget the Raw Science in the water just there as well.  You'll wanna run to the [Ice Caps Mint Container](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Caps_Mint_Container) as this will be your 4th location. Feel free to bring 1 grass plank you cut down for the laser and 1 weed stem from the dandelion. These might come in handy later for a time saver.  


* Run straight to the [Westerly Ant Hill](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Western_Grasslands_Ant_Hill) after completing the Machine and enter to retrieve the Rotten Bee Armour set as this will help a lot for early gameplay survival, try grab all Raw Science from there as well. From this point you'll have 2 options, you can either pickup the Grave Robbery chip, as BurgL may ask for it as a Quest, or just leave it until he asks for it, I pick it up and run the risk of RNG with BurgL, using the save load feature before talking to BurgL can let you control your quests a little, so ill do that until BurgL says, Retrieve Grave Robbery Chip &amp; Hedge Lab Chip with any other quest. (these 2 chip retrievals are important 1st step for me imo)

While on my way to the [Oak Lab](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Oak_Lab) you'll wanna be visiting the [Tropicop Punch-O](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Tropicop_Punch-O) &amp; [Lemon Crime Punch-O](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Lemon_Crime_Punch-O) juice boxes, this should unlock Natural Explorer Mutation, make sure you equip it. If you don't path to [Lemon Crime Punch-O](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Lemon_Crime_Punch-O) after the [Tropicop Punch-O](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Tropicop_Punch-O), then going past the [Old Ant Hill](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Anthills) should set off Natural Explorer. I try grab everything i will need to craft 4-5 beds as ill be placing a few of them along the way to reset spawn points and stock up on food, personally ill avoid grabbing any Acorn Tops from the ground spawn locations at the Oak Tree but will grab any Acorn Pieces or Acorn Shells on my way past as they will come in handy for a food source, much better saturation then mushrooms, the shells for a Acorn Shovel.

  
I avoid Tazy-T and sprint past him, i help BurgL, then kill Tazy-T while BurgL is ranting, also quickly sprinting around and grabbing all Raw Science from the Lab. Leave what's down in the water behind BurgL until later. If you've brought your 1 weed stem and 1 grass plank with you it can be left here just in case BurgL asks us to scan them for a quest you wont need to leave the lab to do it. Grab the Grasslands Chip off the ground. You'll either now be just holding the Grasslands Chip or also have the Grave Robbery Chip from the Ant Hill as well. Ill be always hoping BurgL wants his Grave Robbery Chip as a quest so i can give him both at the same time, the Grasslands and Grave. If he is offering the Jungle Temple Chip (Hedge Lab) as a quest then your in luck, if not then you'll be met with a decision later on. Basically here, you want the quests, Grave Robbery, Jungle Temple and whatever else as a 3rd, but scan or markers are obviously best. Quests for markers at Spade Gulch, Plank Cliff or Toad Swamp are best. The way i force this a little is by saving before i talk to BurgL then i just reload until i get those 2 quests, Grave Robbery &amp; Jungle Temple.

&amp;#x200B;

* When leaving from getting the 1st 3 BurgL quests you'll wanna go straight down and grab Lilly Pad Wax, this will unlock the Pebblet Dagger. You can hot craft 1 and quickly grab yourself some Eelgrass. I always try grab close to 10 of each the Lilly Pad Wax &amp; Eelgrass.  
Now, head straight towards the [Hedge Lab](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Hedge_Lab). Any path you feel is safe, try to avoid all creatures but still complete your BurgL quest along the way. Fingers crossed its the marker quest i mentioned earlier. Try to grab 5 clay on your venture for a Spinning Wheel needed later on.  


When i get down into the Hedge area, I'm aiming at grabbing the Rotten Ant Club from the cave to give me a high damage attack. Now is when id be putting on the Rotten Bee Armour in case you come across a spider, can be worth building a bed and setting a spawn point somewhere here, just to be safe. Grab your Rotten Ant Club and Ant Head Totem Recipe.

&amp;#x200B;

* Enter the [Hedge Ascent](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Hedge_Ascent) by going up the branch where the green paperclip is located, hopefully you've pathed past some Berries and you can grab them as well, you'll be wanting at least 15 Berry Chunks. If you cant get enough by this point try grabbing the Pebblets off the ground around you so you can throw them at some Berries and knock them down. You'll pass a Field Station once you go up the branch, make sure to analyse your Eelgrass &amp; take the Granola Bars. This should unlock the Gill Tube breathing apparatus. We will grab some Silk Rope later on from the storage room in the [Hedge Lab](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Hedge_Lab) to craft 1. Path thru the tree branches until you get to the [Flingman Flying Disc](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Flingman_Flying_Disc), i like to place another bed on the thick branch on the opposite side to where you enter the disc from, and set my spawn point.

Your basically now gonna break every Web Sack on the [Flingman Flying Disc](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Flingman_Flying_Disc). Be careful of the Spiderlings and be careful of your drops as they can roll off or be kicked off by a Spiderling. I like the spam pickup as i break the Web Sack with the last hit. We really wanna be getting Boiling Gland, Bombardier Parts, Stinkbug Parts and Ladybug Head. These are the only drops from Web Sacks (despite Gnat Fuzz). Picking up a Bombardier Part should unlock the Tier 2 Insect Axe, and picking up Boiling Gland should unlock the tier 2 Insect Hammer. Hopefully you got enough of these parts to craft the tools (1 Lady Bug Head, 4 Stinkbug Parts, 1 Boiling Gland, 3 Bombardier Parts). Now its onto the Hedge lab. I'm not gonna explain how to complete this, as this is nothing special.

&amp;#x200B;

* Make sure to grab the Silk Rope &amp; Quartzite from the storage room located in the lab. Make sure to use the Workbench in the lab to craft yourself the Gill Tube and to turn the 15 Berry Chunks into Berry Leather. You should be able to now craft yourself a tier 2 Insect Hammer as well. You now have the decision based on your BurgL quests as to whether you pickup the Jungle Temple Chip or leave it, as its all unlocked now so quick retrieval of the chip is easy later on. You wanna make sure you pickup the Rotten Gas Mask though, its gonna be needed for the Haze Chip. I also like to go get the Broodmother BLT recipe while I'm in this area as this is an easy spot to leave the area from to head back to the Oak Tree, as it'll probably be nightfall by this point.   


As soon as i return to the Oak Tree i place a bed on top of the Leaf draping over the [Welp Flavordrink](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Welp_Flavordrink) and set my respawn point and build a small chest for storage, i also start on a Spinning Wheel as i should have a few Web Fibres i can spin for my Mint Mace and Insect Axe, you should have everything to build the Spinning Wheel except for the 4 Ant Parts, run to the [Old Ant Hill](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Anthills) and kill some ants. Can either sleep or if you pickup the Jungle Temple Chip, then return it to BurgL before Sleeping. Its entirely up to you but depending on in game time, i might consider running over and grabbing the Mints from the [Ice Caps Mint Container](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_Caps_Mint_Container) to get them respawning ASAP. If not don't worry, we will get them soon enough. I personally don't sleep at all and use this night to make sure my Spinning Wheel is made and i have 4 Silk Rope being crafted. Keeping this running at all times early will be helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

* By now, you should be on Day 2, you will already have a few things happening and your tier 2 hammer. You wanna make sure your holding the resources to craft your Tier 2 Insect Axe and your holding the Gill Tube we crafted in the Hedge Lab. Depending on Burgl Quests from here will be how you spend your next day. I was very lucky and after only a few load and saves i got, Retrieve the Stuck In A Haze Lab Chip &amp; Cold Blooded BurgL Chip. So i was able to do both those quickly as you have the Rotten Gas Mask (if you got any Gnat Fuzz from the Web Sacks you can repair it, if not kill some at the Great Oak Beacon). Sprint thru Haze Lab and just retrieve the Chip, we can always return to clear it out later and grab any SCABS, just try grab any Raw Science along the way. I was able to get the Mints at this stage as i was already pathing thru this area on the way to my retrieve quests. Where my bed is setup on the [Welp Flavordrink](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Welp_Flavordrink) i can grab the 8 Flower Petals needed to craft the Mint Mace.  
If you got other BurgL quests at the start of this day then hopefully its either the 2 pond chips or just some analyse quests. If its marker quests id only be accepting Great Oak Beacon or Stepping Stone Summit at this point as we wanna use this day wisely. Ultimately here you want either the 2 pond chips or the 2 land chips (Haze and Cold Blood). Whatever you get you want to complete as quickly as possible!. NO matter what you get when your complete with them you wanna move to the next step......  

* Head towards Stepping Stone Summit, i like swim thru the Pond at this stage, underwater, and i try unlock 2 water landmarks ([Pond Hatch](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Pond_Hatch) &amp; [Wedding Ring](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Wedding_Ring)) that way we are on the way to unlocking our Merteen Mutation giving us increased swim speed and increased breathing time, we already have our Gill Tube so we should be fine. We really want to pickup the Rotten Fin Flops on our way to or way home from the BBQ which is where we are next headed, i say Stepping Stone Summit earlier as going this way unlocks [Frankenline](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Frankenline) and there is easy pathing to the top garden where the BBQ is sitting to grab the 2 high BBQ Chunks before dropping down to grab the 2 bottom ones on the ground near the Stink Bugs. On my way home, if not done, grab the Rotten Fin Flops from the pond wall cave, should be some Raw Science as well.  


Head home and unload your BBQ Chunks, and grab what Silk Rope is needed for the Insect Axe and Mint Mace (think its 13 total). No matter what happens in my game, i spend my time unlocking the entire [Pond Lab](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Pond_Lab). I don't pickup the Chips unless its my BurgL quest. So feel free to do as you want, as we can easily get them later. I swim down to the [Sunken T-Rex](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Sunken_T-Rex) unlocking my 3rd water landmark unlocking Merteen Mutation. Equip it while on the cable bubble. Head down into the depths and into the Hatch with the Raw Science, thru the storage room, grabbing the Silk Rope &amp; Rotten Lamp off the shelf. Grab anything else hard to find or not discovered at this point (Boatman Fins, Diving Spider Chunks, Sunken Bones).  
After hitting the computer i quickly hit each of the 3 boxes, swimming to 1 and going back to storage room for air each time. Once I've done all 3 i head down towards the mossy cave to retrieve the Sunken Treasure Chest key. I will open the chest when swimming out past that area but will not pickup the key, unless it my quest. When you get the key you can head up into the [Pond Lab](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Pond_Lab), you will find another Workbench, like in the [Hedge Lab](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Hedge_Lab), use this to craft your Tier 2 Insect Axe and your Tier 3 Mint Mace. Unlock all the [Pond Lab](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Pond_Lab) and swim out the same way you came in, past the [Sunken T-Rex](https://grounded.fandom.com/wiki/Sunken_T-Rex), allowing you to unlock the Chest for the Sunken treasure Chip and grab your Bee Stinger Spear from the T-Rex mouth.

Depending on your Quests and decisions made then you should now be holding the two Tier 2 Tools (Axe &amp; Hammer) and have the Tier 3 Mint Mace all by Day 2 to 3 in game time, you haven't even scanned a grass plank to unlock a workbench yet, have retrieved 5 of the 7 BurgL chips (depending) and have most of the long hard work completed with unlocking the Labs. You've got Mints and BBQ chunks respawning, can pickup Crow Feather Pieces and cut down Tier 2 Weeds....from here the backyard is yours, you can pretty much overrun anything except a Wolf Spider. Might need better Armour for that.

"Ex wants belongings back, refuses to take them.","Broke up with my ex girlfriend back in December of 2020. When she left, I took her all the things she asked for without question.

Fast forward to August, and she requested that I bring her a fan she had left for me at my place since her air conditioner had broken. No problem, took it over, along with some things she had left in my garage and forgotten about.

She finds out I am dating someone else and wants literally everything back she has ever left or given as a gift, which I am fine with. 

The issue is she has left some very big items at my house (lawn furniture, 10+ large ""art"" canvases she took from a business closing) and she is a hoarder living in an apartment. In the past when we had broken up, I would try to bring her stuff and she would either refuse to open the door, pretending she wasn't home, or tell me she didn't have room for it at the moment.

I want to rent a U-Haul and carry every single thing to her apartment (she's given me a list) and dump it on her doorstep and be done with this forever. However, I'm concerned she will dodge me or, if I show up and leave it, say that someone stole it or damaged it and try and hold me accountable. She has already threatened to sue me for throwing out some sex toys, which I have gladly offered to replace.

I work at a place where my job will be in danger if I have to go to court for something, so I want to try to protect myself in any way possible up to and including hiring a lawyer to do so - she is mentally unstable and capable of doing just about anything to cause me harm.

How do I get her and her stuff out of my life, all at once, legally and forever?",legaladvice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/pcu2ax/ex_wants_belongings_back_refuses_to_take_them/,,oddemergency,pcu2ax,/r/legaladvice/comments/pcu2ax/ex_wants_belongings_back_refuses_to_take_them/,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/pcu2ax/ex_wants_belongings_back_refuses_to_take_them/,2,2021-08-27
I Was A Janitor In A Secret Lab,"Shit‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to lose my fucking job for this, aren‚Äôt I?

Hell, I think I‚Äôll be lucky if I *just* lose my job. 

&amp;#x200B;

But somebody has to say something. I don‚Äôt know what kind of person sees the kind of shit that I‚Äôve seen and just goes about their business. When I was a little kid, my Mom told me to always be honest, which when you think about it isn‚Äôt really great advice. Society is built on a bunch of little white lies. Sometimes, you need a little bit of bullshit to get through the day. Bullshit like: *‚ÄòI am gainfully employed and happy with my life.‚Äô* or *‚ÄòI‚Äôm probably going to be alive in a week‚Äô.* 

I‚Äôm getting off track‚Ä¶ Sorry. It‚Äôs the nerves...

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm not going to share my name, because it would just make me that much easier to find. That said, I‚Äôm pretty sure that won‚Äôt really matter anyways. I work as a janitor for a company known as the Intelligent Projects Division or IPD for short. Maybe you‚Äôve heard of them, maybe you haven‚Äôt. If I‚Äôm being entirely honest, I‚Äôm not 100% sure what they actually do but I know it‚Äôs something scientific. I‚Äôve heard some shady rumors, but nothing definite and honestly it‚Äôs never really been any of my business. I just clean the floors. 

&amp;#x200B;

The building that I work in is just outside Denver, Colorado. It‚Äôs nothing really special. Every night I sign in at security around the same time most of the people in the labs have gone home and I get to work making sure the place is clean for the next morning. I take out the garbage, I wax the floors and I clean the bathrooms among other things. If you‚Äôd asked me fifteen years ago if this was where I saw my life going, I probably would‚Äôve said no. But hey. This is where I am. Might as well make the most of it, right?

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it is kinda cool having full access to some high tech science lab at night. I‚Äôve always had a thing for creepy, abandoned places. Back when I was in high school, me and my buddies were really into urban exploration and we crawled through a lot of old abandoned buildings just to see what was inside. I fucking dig that creepy vibe. It just gives me an adrenaline rush that nothing else has ever really matched. When I stop to think about it, it‚Äôs probably why I am‚Ä¶ Or, was‚Ä¶ so content with my job at the IPD lab. I‚Äôm technically not allowed to touch certain things or go in certain rooms, but it‚Äôs still pretty neat. Most of the rooms I can‚Äôt enter are some of the sterile labs. They‚Äôve got a specialized team for those. I guess the logic is they don‚Äôt want just anyone going in there and possibly fucking something up. There are also a few rooms with active experiments that I‚Äôm not allowed to enter although easily the weirdest off-limits room is the generator room.

&amp;#x200B;

See, near the back of the facility there‚Äôs a nondescript grey door marked with a lightning bolt and in my experience it‚Äôs always been locked. I‚Äôve never actually seen that door open before, and obviously, I‚Äôve never been inside. There‚Äôs a sign on the door reading:   


AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

&amp;#x200B;

I always thought it was a little weird they didn‚Äôt want us to clean that room too, but I just figured it was another issue with the equipment. Someone who doesn‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing could accidentally touch something that shouldn‚Äôt be touched and that might be a problem. Honestly, I never spent too much time thinking about it. I‚Äôve got enough ground to cover without the generator room already so it was always just filed away in the back of my mind along with all the other useless information.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm actually not the only guy on the janitorial night shift. It‚Äôs a pretty big building and there are about two other guys I work with. I don‚Äôt see much of them, and we tend to just stick to our own sectors. But every now and then I‚Äôll either catch a glimpse of them down some hallway or run into them in the breakroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I actually look forward to when we just so happen to take a break at the same time. Enough so that I kinda try to time my breaks with when I think they‚Äôre taking theirs. It helps to have someone to talk to, y‚Äôknow? It‚Äôs better than just sitting alone in an empty lunchroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other guys are pretty chill. One of them, let‚Äôs call him Jeff, has been here for a long time and he seems to know a little more about what they do here than I do. Now, I‚Äôm sure that some of what he says is just made up, but it‚Äôs still awfully fun to listen to him talk. According to him, the eggheads here are trying to research some sci-fi shit like how to grow human organs and create more effective GMOs. I know that probably doesn‚Äôt sound particularly interesting but I mean, it‚Äôs cool to have some idea on what they‚Äôre doing in those labs, though.

&amp;#x200B;

By far the creepiest story I‚Äôve ever heard him tell though is the story of Elsa Stapelton. Jeff tells it better than I ever will. But I‚Äôll put in my best effort to recount it here.

&amp;#x200B;

About seven or eight years ago, one of the higher ups, Dr. Joseph Stapelton got called in for questioning by the Police. Apparently, someone had recently declared his wife Elsa missing.   
According to Jeff, Dr. Stapelton told the police that he and Elsa were separated and he had no idea where she‚Äôd gone. But the guy stayed at the top of the suspects list anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Jeff said he‚Äôd been following the case at the time, and he‚Äôd, later on, heard that the Police had found some video footage of Elsa Stapelton at a gas station a good ways south of Denver. A gas station attendant had reportedly described her as acting erratic and jittery as if she was expecting someone to come in after her while she paid for her gas, which created the theory that she was running from someone. Then a few days later, somebody found her car in a ditch on the side of the highway, although there was no trace of Elsa inside.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, nobody ever figured out what actually happened to Elsa Stapelton although the consensus was that she‚Äôd been high on something, driven off the road, and then wandered off into the woods. The answer didn‚Äôt seem to satisfy her family, who just blamed Dr. Stapelton but the police eventually just stopped their investigation after running out of leads.

&amp;#x200B;

I got the vibe that Jeff thought that Stapelton was probably actually behind the whole thing, but if the police weren‚Äôt able to prove it, then he sure as hell wasn‚Äôt going to. Honestly, I figured he just told the story just to keep the drama of the mystery alive and I could respect that hustle. Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I sorta liked the creepy ambiance it added to working alone in that lab, knowing that there was a real life unsolved mystery tied to the place. Is that morbid? Maybe it‚Äôs a little morbid. But I‚Äôve always had a thing for creepy environments. They just give me such an adrenaline rush!

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, I‚Äôd even swear I heard voices in the hall. I figured it was probably the other two janitors but I liked the ambiance it added and‚Ä¶ Okay, this might sound a little weird, but I sorta thought the idea of hearing the ghostly screams of Elsa Stapelton was a little neat, in a horror movie kinda way. It added to the creepy vibe this whole place gave off at night although I never actually put any stock into the idea of Dr. Stapelton having murdered his wife or something.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôd actually seen the guy a few times and he just looked like someone's stern middle aged, balding dad. I genuinely couldn‚Äôt imagine him as an actual killer. It was just a neat little ghost story to accompany my fun, slightly creepy job and hey that was enough for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I got into work today at about the same time I always do. I signed in with security, put on my coveralls in the locker room and grabbed my cart. I chatted with the other janitors for a bit before we went our separate ways and got to work. For the most part, tonight was going more or less just like any other night. I‚Äôd smuggled my headphones in and was listening to a true crime podcast while I worked since nobody was going to fucking stop me and was feeling pretty damn good about myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I did notice that burning ozone smell in the air pretty early on, but I didn‚Äôt think too much about it. Yeah, it was a little weird. But I also work in a weird science lab. Weird is sorta the norm. I‚Äôd smelled it a few times before over the past couple of months so it didn‚Äôt bother me that much. It wasn‚Äôt until a few hours in that I started to hear the distortion in my audio. Like a really heavy static. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was the podcast at first. But when I tried to go back, the static just kept getting worse. It didn‚Äôt get any better when I tried to switch podcasts either and I didn‚Äôt think it was my headphones. That just sorta left one more suspect‚Ä¶ My actual phone and that definitely spooked me a bit. The last thing I needed was for my phone to crap out on me in the middle of a shift!

&amp;#x200B;

I turned it off and was in the middle of turning it back on again when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. Something moved. I looked up, just down the hall. I didn‚Äôt see anyone but I could‚Äôve sworn that somebody just moved.

I called out:

  ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Then I called out for the other two janitors. No response.

&amp;#x200B;

I figured it was probably just a trick of my mind or something‚Ä¶ But I had to at least check. I went down the hall and rounded the corner and that‚Äôs when I saw them.

&amp;#x200B;

They were standing right at the end of the hall. Almost as if they were waiting for me. I couldn‚Äôt get a good look at them all the way over there, but I could tell that they were wearing a white lab coat, although the coat itself looked kinda dirty. I could see bits of black on it. The figure‚Ä¶ I think it was a woman, stood expectantly at the end of the hall, just looking at me.

&amp;#x200B;

That ozone smell seemed a little bit stronger but it might‚Äôve just been my imagination. 

  ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called again. Still no response. The figure at the end of the hall just kept staring at me.

 ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre supposed to be in here!‚Äù I said and took a step forward. As I did, the woman just sorta‚Ä¶ vanished. One moment she was there, the next she was gone. I don‚Äôt even think I blinked!

&amp;#x200B;

I stared at the spot where she‚Äôd been for a moment, not sure just what the hell to think before I headed over to the spot where she‚Äôd been.

  ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam?‚Äù I called again.

That burning ozone smell was definitely stronger and as I made it to the spot where the woman had been standing, I swear I felt a strange static in the air.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked around and down another hallway, I spotted her. She was a little bit closer this time. I could see that she had short, dark hair and I thought I could see just a little bit of her face as she watched me from the corner of her eye. The moment she seemed satisfied that I‚Äôd noticed her, she was gone again, leaving the hallway empty.

&amp;#x200B;

My heart was pounding in my chest at this point‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd worked at this place for a few years and I‚Äôd never fucking seen anything like this before! I stared at the spot where the woman had been. I didn‚Äôt know if I should follow or not‚Ä¶ If she was really there, and that was quite possibly a big fucking If, following her was probably a bad idea. Hell, I didn‚Äôt even know how the hell she was moving the way she was!

&amp;#x200B;

The silence of the lab around me didn‚Äôt seem so cool anymore. If anything, now it just felt suffocating. There was a low hum of distant machinery that echoed faintly through the halls as I remained paralyzed to the spot. The burning ozone smell seemed to be a little bit stronger. 

&amp;#x200B;

Further down the hall, I noticed the shape of that woman standing and waiting for me. She stared at me, too far away to see clearly although her face looked‚Ä¶ It looked so pale. She stood there, waiting for me to move and I knew that I couldn‚Äôt stay put any longer‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

It was obvious now that she wanted me to notice her. She wanted me to follow her although to where‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt so sure. Slowly, I moved my feet and took a step forward. As I did, she disappeared again. I approached the spot where she‚Äôd been just a few moments before and as I looked down, I noticed a black mark on the floor as if something radiating incredible heat had been there‚Ä¶ Some part of me wondered if I could even scrub something like that out, but it got pushed to the back of my mind considering that I had bigger fish to fry.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked down the next hallway and spotted the grey door leading to the Generator room. The woman was standing in front of it, her back to me. Her head turned slightly as if she wanted to confirm that I was behind her, then she was gone again. The smell of something burning filled my nostrils. It was strong enough to make me gag.

&amp;#x200B;

The grey door to the generator room swung slightly on its hinges. I‚Äôd never seen that door open before‚Ä¶ She‚Äôd gone inside and she wanted me to follow. I didn‚Äôt want to go. I‚Äôd been content to leave that room the hell alone since day one and I didn‚Äôt exactly want to start breaking rules now. But whatever this was‚Ä¶ Whatever I was seeing, I had to see where it was leading me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôd be lying if I said it didn‚Äôt occur to me that I‚Äôd probably walk through that door and immediately die. But then again, if whatever that woman was wanted to kill me, why not just do it in the hall? I was already well enough alone. No‚Ä¶ No, I‚Äôm not so sure that I *needed* to be afraid of her. Was I still afraid? Absofuckinglutely. But if she wanted to hurt me, she‚Äôd had her chance. That thought was enough to make me take a step forward and approach the grey door.

&amp;#x200B;

I could see that the handle was almost burned clean off, as if someone had taken a blowtorch to it‚Ä¶ The sight of it made me pause before I gingerly reached out and pushed the door open. I was greeted by fluorescent lights and a bland concrete room. There were a few storage racks on the left hand side, but most of the room was taken up by three large, grey square devices that looked a lot like the power transformers you sometimes see on the street, close to buildings. They hummed quietly although really didn‚Äôt look all that different from any other transformer I‚Äôd ever seen. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was no trace of the woman inside although that burning ozone smell was almost overpowering in there. I wondered for a moment if it was from the transformers and maybe that was what she was trying to warn me about, but I couldn‚Äôt be sure.

&amp;#x200B;

I stood near the door before covering my mouth and nose with my shirt and awkwardly taking a step inside.

  ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out although I was more than a little relieved when nobody answered.

The lights flickered and sent a chill through me. For a moment, I thought I saw a figure standing near the back of the room but it was probably just my imagination‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

I stood still, feeling my hands shake a little bit as I scanned the room for any sign of that woman I‚Äôd seen. But as far as I could tell, there was no one else there but me. The lights flickered again and sent a fresh jolt of panic through me. I glanced over at the transformers before deciding that it was time to get the hell out of there. I‚Äôd report the smell to security and let them figure out how to deal with this mess! This was way above my fucking paygrade!

&amp;#x200B;

That was when I noticed her again‚Ä¶ Right in the corner of my eye. This time, just a few steps away from me. God‚Ä¶ I could feel her the moment she appeared. I could feel the rippling static coming off of her. That burning smell radiated off of her and I could taste it in my throat and I didn‚Äôt want to turn to look at her. But I couldn‚Äôt help myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Her skin was completely devoid of color and looked almost like cracked porcelain. Two empty eye sockets burned into mine and I could see something black and tar like liquid dripping down her cheeks like burning tears. That same liquid ran down the corner of her mouth and I could see the smoke rising off of her as it burned her broken skin. She only barely looked human‚Ä¶ She looked more like the husk of what was left of a human and I only needed a glimpse of her before I screamed and shot backwards to get as far away from her as possible. I didn‚Äôt notice or care what was behind me and I crashed hard into one of the transformers. I felt part of it give way as I slipped down to the ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

The grotesque husk of a person had vanished, just like she had before and she‚Äôd left only that burning smell behind‚Ä¶ But it was only when I looked up that I saw what it was she‚Äôd wanted so desperately to show me.

&amp;#x200B;

When I‚Äôd crashed into the ‚Äòtransformer‚Äô I‚Äôd knocked a panel loose and it had swung open. I‚Äôve seen the inside of a transformer before. There should be some switches and machinery in there. Not a human being.

&amp;#x200B;

The woman I was looking at was bald and wore only a tight fitting suit with various nodes connected to it. I could see thick wires running down from metal sockets in her neck and the back of her head.  Her eyes were open and bloodshot‚Ä¶ I could feel them shift to look at me and their gaze petrified me.

&amp;#x200B;

I stared at this woman with my mouth open in a silent scream. Her body trembled as she struggled to open her mouth and the only sound that could escape her was a hoarse rasp.

&amp;#x200B;

  *‚ÄúHelp‚Ä¶ Me‚Ä¶‚Äù*

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôm ashamed to admit that the only thing I could do was stare‚Ä¶ It wasn‚Äôt just the stomach turning disgust at seeing a live human being strung up like that‚Ä¶  No, although that by itself would‚Äôve been more than enough. It was the fact that I recognized her face.

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôd seen it when Jeff had told me about Elsa Stapelton. I‚Äôd seen that face when I‚Äôd dug up old news stories, looking to see if there was any truth to that little unsolved mystery he‚Äôd shared with me. I‚Äôd seen her face in the reports of a missing woman whose car had been found outside of Denver, a woman who everyone thought was dead. A woman who was hooked up to the machine in front of me, powering this facility.

&amp;#x200B;

  *‚ÄúHelp‚Ä¶ Me‚Ä¶‚Äù*

&amp;#x200B;

Her voice was hoarse. Raspy. Barely even a whisper. She looked at me, unblinking and quaking. Her hands were restrained behind her. She couldn‚Äôt get herself free on her own‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt so sure I could help her get free‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt even know how the hell the machine she was hooked up to even worked! My eyes drifted over towards the other two transformers.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to know‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

Taking one last look at Elsa Stapelton, I approached the other two transformers. Slowly, I opened one of them and steeled myself for what would be waiting inside for me. I was greeted by the unblinking eyes of a man, hooked up to the same device. Just looking into those eyes, I knew that he was alive. Feeling bile rising up in my stomach, I forced myself to look at what was inside the last transformer.

&amp;#x200B;

Another man, hooked up just as Elsa and his neighbor were‚Ä¶ All three of them, bound and helpless. All three of them, human batteries. Sick experiments. Had Dr. Stapelton done this? Was this his work? Jesus, had he done this to his own wife? I didn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt fucking want to know.

&amp;#x200B;

With shaking hands, I reached up to try and help the man in front of me. That was a mistake. The moment I touched one of the wires coming out of his skull I felt a painful shock course through my body, urging a pained scream from me.

&amp;#x200B;

Once when I was a kid, I accidentally touched the metal part of the plug while plugging in the dryer‚Ä¶ Touching that wire felt exactly like that. The pain sent me backward, clutching my arm to my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

The three human batteries stared helplessly at me‚Ä¶ and I knew there was nothing I could do for them. I couldn‚Äôt unplug them! Hell, I didn‚Äôt even know if unplugging them was even an option! I looked back towards the shelves behind me, desperately hoping that a solution might reveal itself. There wasn‚Äôt much‚Ä¶ Just a few dusty supplies. Most of them didn‚Äôt look useful save for one.

&amp;#x200B;

A small blue box cutter‚Ä¶  Oh God‚Ä¶ Was I really considering this?

&amp;#x200B;

I looked down at the box cutter and from behind me, I heard one of the men sobbing.

 *‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶‚Äù*

His eyes were still trained on me. Unblinking. Pleading.

  *‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Slowly, I reached down and I picked up the box cutter.

&amp;#x200B;

Their eyes were on me‚Ä¶ They were watching me. Silently begging for me to do it. What choice did I have? I couldn‚Äôt leave them like that! I couldn‚Äôt let them suffer! I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never killed anyone before‚Ä¶ But when someone is in that bad of a state, what else can you do?

&amp;#x200B;

I did the man in the middle first. I reached out to touch his shoulder, careful not to touch the wires. He closed his eyes and seemed to lift his head up as if he was begging me to do it‚Ä¶ I closed my own eyes, took a deep breath and‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

I did Elsa second. I remember that as I raised the shaking hand that held the bloody boxcutter to her throat, I heard her whisper:

 *‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶‚Äù*

It didn‚Äôt make it any easier.

&amp;#x200B;

I don‚Äôt know if I made the right choice‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Ä¶ I ended their suffering. I know that. I did the only thing I could have done to help them! That‚Äôs right, isn‚Äôt it?

Oh God‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

I took photographs of what I saw in that room‚Ä¶ I have the box cutter still. I‚Äôm going to go to the Police. There‚Äôs the possibility that I‚Äôll be called a murderer, but I don‚Äôt care. What I did to those people was mercy, after what my employers did to them.

&amp;#x200B;

In case I don‚Äôt make it to the Police though, I‚Äôm going to share this to get the word out. If I fail‚Ä¶ If the IPD stops me from taking this public, somebody should know. I need people to know what they did...

&amp;#x200B;

There‚Äôs one other thing‚Ä¶ That thing I saw in the halls‚Ä¶ The woman that led me to the generator room. I‚Äôm not sure of much, but I am sure that that wasn‚Äôt Elsa. I don‚Äôt know who or what it was‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

I think that it led me there knowing I could help those people and set them free one way or another. Maybe I helped them avoid becoming whatever it is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. But something tells me that the IPD has done far worse than what was done to Elsa and those two men. And something tells me that even if they stop me from getting the word out, they‚Äôve got something much, much bigger to worry about.",HeadOfSpectre,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/pcruzp/i_was_a_janitor_in_a_secret_lab/,‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°,HeadOfSpectre,pcruzp,/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/pcruzp/i_was_a_janitor_in_a_secret_lab/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/pcruzp/i_was_a_janitor_in_a_secret_lab/,2,2021-08-27
F4M Miss USA Fucks Her Way Across the Country,"It wasn't hard to see that morale was at an all time low in this country. Everybody was arguing and not a soul could get along. People would disagree just to disagree so nothing could ever get done. People got angrier so more arguing ensued which just made people even angrier and so on and so forth. The one thing everyone could agree on was that this country was going downhill, and the best way to fix that would be to make everyone happy. Well, not everyone, just men. After all, men are the ones who make the decisions, right? That's when the government partnered with the Miss USA pageant to fix this issue.  
  
It's time to make Miss USA live up to the name and truly take care of the men of this country. It's no longer good enough to just be hot and be able to sing. No, you needed to have real talent. They gathered us all up and told us the new deal of being Miss USA. For the next year (and perhaps even longer), Miss USA would have to fuck their way across the United States. This means going from city to city, hitting all the major places in every single state. Once every state had been taken care of, we'd get a lump sum of cash that would be more than any person could ever need and we'd be on our way, if we chose. There's always room for a second tour.  
  
They told us this and gave us a chance to back out. A couple girls did, but for some reason, most of us didn't. Why didn't we? Who knows. Some people just want the fame, others want the money. We all also knew that backing out would be a death sentence for whatever career aspirations we had in mind.  
  
On TV, the pageant remained the same. We sang, danced, and strutted around in our tiny bikinis as we pretended like it mattered for who won. Behind the curtains, though, the real tests were occurring. What'd we look like naked? How perky are our boobs? What do our asses feel and look like? How fast can you make a man cum with your mouth? How fast while riding them? Who had the best feeling mouth, pussy, ass? Did you participate in the rimming test? How many spanks could you handle? The list went on and on. It was a very grueling trial.  
  
But at the end of the day, I won, somehow. I wasn't going to argue. I'm now Miss USA! It wouldn't be a surprise to the people at home either. I'm your standard cute blonde with a bubbly personality, perky boobs, a tight round ass, and a great body who's going to be a lawyer. Next comes the tour, though, and the real job.  
  
It's marketed as a photo op and fan meet-and-greet, but only men are accepted. They have to provide proof of identity, be over the age of 18, a clean bill of health from an appointed doctor, were you coming alone or in a group, and documentation of cock size. The bigger the cock, the earlier you get your turn. If you checked the boxes, you were accepted. Didn't matter who you were. College age to nursing home, fat or skinny, black or white or Asian, it didn't matter how hairy, sweaty, or musky, if you were over 18 with a ""clean"" cock, you got to fuck Miss USA.  
  
People would line up and wait their turns. There was a set amount of time each day, so if we didn't get to everyone, we'd come back the next day and do it again. Once we took care of one city, it was onto the next. The tour would go on until we finished the list. Thus began my journey as Miss USA.  
  
Hi there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt. I'm looking for some lovely (or not so lovely) gentlemen who would like to use my version of Miss USA. This will be a made up person and not the actual Miss USA, just for clarification. Here is my [kinklist](https://imgur.com/kLPkmN1).  
  
You can play as any man you please! You can be yourself or a group of guys or several of the men throughout the tour. Please tell me you who you are in the first message. Put your favorite fruit in the title or I won't answer :)  
  
I hope to get some lovely messages soon! \~Jenna",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pcu0tl/f4m_miss_usa_fucks_her_way_across_the_country/,,dpp_jenna,pcu0tl,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pcu0tl/f4m_miss_usa_fucks_her_way_across_the_country/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pcu0tl/f4m_miss_usa_fucks_her_way_across_the_country/,1,2021-08-27
I have been watching the Spider-Man No Way Home trailer and I think i know what the Sinister Six will be.....,"Doctor Octopus(of course)
Electro(of course)
Green Goblin(of course)
The next lot are speculation from what I saw in the trailer.

Sandman(there was Sand Moving in the Electro part.)
Lizard Maybe(it looks more like a something else to me, but everyone things the shadow was Lizard)

the next one is a Stretch but....

Evil Doctor Strange from The What if Trailers( one scene of the trailer had a Fight Scene with trains.
In it Strange was fighting Peter with Trains in the Mirror place.

Well I noticed Strange was Dressed different and it looks like Evil Stranges outfit.

Here are some Bonus ideas

Scorpion( he was in the post credit scene in Homecoming. And the Maybe Lizard scene it looked more like a Scorpion tale being hit with magic. Plus there was a leaked lego set with Scorpion in the Doctor strange bulding(I don't know how it is spelled and I know I will mess it up, sankton santoran? Nope)
So I think Scorpion is a Must..

Mysterio: I think the main universe one is dead, but multiverse one that turns good and clears peters name?
Probably not that last part but I think he may be in this.)


Anyway what do you think?

And please don't roast me to hard on saying Doctor strange building lol.....

Anyway I am Excited for this movie because it has my two favourite heroes in it.",marvelstudios,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/pcja7p/i_have_been_watching_the_spiderman_no_way_home/,Theory,King_Illager,pcja7p,/r/marvelstudios/comments/pcja7p/i_have_been_watching_the_spiderman_no_way_home/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/pcja7p/i_have_been_watching_the_spiderman_no_way_home/,25,2021-08-27
[M4GM] Looking for monster girls,"Hey! So as the title suggests, I‚Äôm looking for someone to play as a monster girl or several of them in an Rp for me. 

One idea that I had in mind for plot, was a sort of revenge quest: after my home is ransacked and destroyed, I set out for revenge with the surviving monster girl, encountering others among the way. 
Another idea I had was to leave home for a quest to prove myself with one of the monsters accompanying me. These of course present more of a GM role for you.

If you had any ideas, don‚Äôt hesitate to say so, I‚Äôd love to hear!

Kinks and limits can be discussed over Kik, but I will say now that I‚Äôm not into transformation, hyper, inflation, or non con. Please don‚Äôt just ‚Äújump‚Äù straight into an rp.

I am not sure if I should breakup,"I am in my mid 30's and my gf (yes... Gf) is 2 years older than me.
We met a few month pre pandemic. 

Me and my family tend to have major conflicts over dumb things. 
A family member was coming out from the hospital, they needed peace and I wasn't in my right place of mind to give peace to said family member, so I decided to leave until the family member fully recovered. I want to clarify that I usually confront a very toxic family member and crisis ensues. 

She liked the idea of me staying in her apartment for as long as I needed. 
We weren't serious back then, we did talk about our most inner scars and how people have hurt us and so on... Things you don't tell just anyone. 

Since the beginning I felt attached emotionally to her because I felt related in many things about life that we didn't like, we understood each other and we still do.

When we started dating she was on a relationship with another woman, and tbh, she was being treated very VERY bad, so I do not blame her at all for what was happening... Hell not even her ex has said a single word... That's how bad she treated her. 



Prior to her, in all my relationships I ravaged them with kisses and fondling and it was mutual, I felt very attracted to them... But, this is not the case in this relationship, it is more of an emotional connection... It's all about emotional connection and nothing at all about physical attraction, we still have needs... Though she was happy arousing me other ways... If you catch my drift and I didn't mind.

After a while of moving in, few weeks, the pandemic struck... And well panic ensued, we didn't want to see our parents so that we wouldn't hurt them. I enjoyed those times a lot, I really did. I felt like every day was Saturday with her. 

She is a really good person, one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to meet... Not only that, she has cleared a lot of the fog I had on my mind and I was able to think about the things I lack in life and to ponder about my insecurities, to make peace with the wrong doings and to find courage and anger within me rather than submission and false arrogance.

Not long ago my parents were vaccinated, we both lost out jobs and she is living with her parents and I am living with mine.
My parents do not like her... AT ALL, I can't say this is a non factor but definitely not the main decider on how I feel. But they do try really hard to set us apart. 

Once they stated that either I stop talking to her or I should simply leave the house l. I refused and said I would leave the house then, they asked if I was moving in with her and told them things are different and I do not know where I will go. My parents ended up retracting and that I should come back home... However they still think we have to talk about this. 

They don't think she makes make a good effort in life and that she doesn't make an effort either, and well she has bad parents, just like I do. That's why we are compatible. 

My parents aren't bad people, they are just old fashioned people that were very successful in life and believe the way to help someone is to make them do things exactly how they think it should be... Some of you already have an idea of the mental health issues this brings... And I feel I am lucky I even became aware in the first place, there are some that may never wake up from that dreadful nightmare. They are not bad people, they are bad parents. 

Nowadays that we are apart she feels this and she is constantly making me feel pressured, questioning me if I love her, that I should just end it and I simply freeze, don't know what to do and just remain silent... I do not have the guts to tell her it's over for some reasons:

I feel like I owe her...
I feel like if I stop seeing her my mental health will come crashing down once again.... I already feel it since we are apart.
I don't want to hurt her. 
I do not feel physically attracted to her
I thought I didn't want kids, I am not sure anymore but definitely can not have kids anytime soon and she has 2 more years before turning 40. 
I think I will ruin her life if I do so. 


I do not want her to be miserable, if someone who listened very well about my dilemma told me, well boy, just man up and save her like she saved you... Then I would stay with her until I die because I feel so guilty to think about ending it all.


Thanks for reading

Tl;dr after 2 years of relationship, I know that I am no physically attracted to her even though we have had very good days together and its weighin in our relationship. Don't want to break up because I don't want to hurt her. Parents despise her.

[M4F] Of Angels and Daughters [Incest/Slavery],"Every night you heard them, roaring past your apartment, on the way to their dive bar clubhouse, a bunch of walking talking cliches. Big men, big bikes, big eyeroll. Hell's Angels indeed.  
  
Sometimes you noticed girls on the back, barely dressed, ponytails flying in the wind. Must be hookers, you thought. Strippers at best.   
  
Little did you, or anyone else know, that the Hells Angels made their money these days from slavery. Taking girls, selling girls, using girls. Snatched to order, taken, broken and sold onto the highest bidder. But in your case...your buyer was somebody you know.   
  
Tonight's walk home from work was the same as all the others. Dark, cold and just a little further than you'd have liked.   
  
Then you heard it. The thud, thud, thud of the bikes. In front, and behind...and next thing you knew, you awoke, chained to a wall in complete darkness.   
  
\---------------------------  
  
Hey, so just a little play on a tired cliche! The Hells Angels of (insert city here) have moved on from gun running, and drug dealing, into the much more lucrative field of sex slavery. Perhaps you play a single mum, minding her own business on her way home from work. Or a college student, working late one night...let's talk!  
  
Kinks include: Non/dub con, bondage, kidnapping, domination, blackmail, mind games, breaking, gaslighting, stockhome syndrome, roughness, and much more.  
  
Limits: No underage, no hippies. Alright, maybe hippies.

My 4 year old is terrified of the school bus and I don't know what to do,"My sweet boy has never had any behavioral problems until recently.  We were a two parent household until my husband left last year.  Last year he went to school two days a week.  On Mondays my husband would take him to school and pick him up and Tuesdays I would do the same.  Well, he is completely terrified of the bus.  Yesterday was his first day of school and he ran in front of a car as soon as he saw the bus coming up the hill.  Then we tried to get him on the bus and he refused.  After talking about it later in the day he promised my mom he would ride the bus today.  So today comes and he's crying and shaking all morning, telling me he doesn't feel good.  He was lying because he was fine until he realized it was time to go to school.  He fought with me and was kicking me in the kitchen and wouldn't let me put his book bag on.  Then we went outside and he kept running back towards the house.  He was rolling around in the grass and the mulch and screaming.  I just literally sat there and cried because there is nothing I could do.  He is 60 lbs and way too big for me to pick up and handle by myself.  I had to call off work today because he was too distraught to actually go to school afterwards.  He will be going self transport next week with his dad and then we will try the bus again on Tuesday.  I am lost on what to do.  I know he doesn't have to ride the bus, but I feel like what I""m doing is positively reinforcing his negative behavior.  Two days in a row he got to stay home because he threw an insane temper tantrum.  His father is no help with helping me navigate this.  He tells me I just have to figure it out or just make him ride the bus.  The thing is, I can't.  I can't make this child get on the bus because he is TERRIFIED.  We tried talking about it and he just told me the bus isn't safe.  I don't know how to get to the root of the problem.  He seems find talking about the bus and says he will go on the bus until the time actually comes.  

I dealt with this but not until I was older.  I was probably in junior high when I was refusing to go to school.  I had severe anxiety and my mom pushing me to get on the school bus really was the worst thing possible to happen to me.  They would drag me out so I would be a mess and get on the bus and everyone would stare at me while my hair was a mess and my clothes were torn.  It was awful.  I don't want that to happen to my son, but also don't want this to be that big of a hurdle for him as it was for me.  It turned out that I had agoraphobia so I was afraid of public transport.  I didn't have trouble going to school once I was able to drive myself.  I just need some advice on this if anyone can help out?  I know he's still very young.",Parenting,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/pcnp27/my_4_year_old_is_terrified_of_the_school_bus_and/,Child 4-9 Years,shesagoodfella,pcnp27,/r/Parenting/comments/pcnp27/my_4_year_old_is_terrified_of_the_school_bus_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/pcnp27/my_4_year_old_is_terrified_of_the_school_bus_and/,6,2021-08-27
"A Long Truth re: DB, Integrity, Temptation, Consequences, Responsibility, Surrender"," This also posted in my comments section because I am new to Reddit and an idiot so I hope this is where it should be? 

**A Long Truth re: DB, Integrity, Temptation, Consequences, Responsibility, Surrender**

Because when I asked enough of you encouraged me to share and because I think that some of this could be helpful for those wondering about their situation and who may not be as far along as I am. Outside of altering some specifics for discretion that will not change the important facts, this is the truth. It will be long because it can't be otherwise and I think most of the readers might find themselves somewhere in the middle of this history, but maybe not so many have reached as far as where I find myself currently and that might be helpful to hear.

Quickly: As they all do, my first girlfriend broke my heart. Not important, other than to let everyone know that in the handful of years that followed, I was able to accumulate all the wild and thrilling experiences one would hope to have trying to kill the pain and sow my oats until I realized that I wanted to have someone more permanent in my life, someone to love.

A little about me. I had very low self esteem growing up but was a natural athlete, a genuinely knightly romantic who would protect those weaker than myself and especially women. I earned a reputation for doing so and as it turns out I am not bad looking. I learned a lot after my first heartbreak, had a lot of ONS's including threesomes, had a thing for cougars and they me. I feel that I am a generous lover who's partners pleasure has always been more important than my own. I am straight but outside of that, there is nothing I wouldn't run up the flag pole. Point being, I was open to most forms of pleasure and in no way vanilla.

That being told, after those few years, I really wanted someone to love and have love me. Those wild times were great, but I wanted someone to call my own. I craved that. And once I was open to that I found my wife.

Now some will doubt love at first sight exists, but this was close and it is important here because my love for my wife is what blinded me to what would become the biggest issue of our marriage which was the DB. I blame myself for much of what will follow because I dealt with this from the start and fought for my relationship convincing myself at every step that it would get better. To be clear, I walked into the DB willingly at the very beginning. This wasn't a great thing that cooled off, this was me believing (sadly) that time and love would make it better.

In the beginning most relationships are hot and heavy. This was mine. Intimacy was rare, planned and mechanical. To this day I have never been with my wife more than once in a 24 hour period. Her MO was to shower and offer me what she thought I needed before bed once every couple of weeks but even though we share a genuine love for each other, she had to force herself to be with me. She approached it as a responsibility, not out of any need or desire on her part, not for me, for us or even for herself. When I was in the mood and as often was the case she wasn't she would expose herself so that I could rub one out, or if she was willing, I was often given a time limit of 5 mins before she would become dry or sore. This was the beginning of the emasculation. It was not intentional on her part but the reality was that she was conditioning someone that would like to bang for hours to work through it in a manner of minutes. I have to say here, that I am no slacker in bed. She wasn't unmotivated by any type of poor performance or size issues on my end. I have never had any complaints. Not from previous lovers or even my wife. Her only complaint was that I lasted to long or wanted to try ""weird"" stuff like using toy's to see if it would help. In fact she never had an orgasm until she was with me.

I know most of you would have already checked out, but like I said earlier, I convinced myself that with time things would get better and outside of this one hugely important issue my wife was and remains the woman of my dreams, my best friend and the person I wanted to spend my life with. So, while dating I was convinced she would open up when I committed, then when I confessed my love, when I proposed, I prayed that when she got pregnant (a sore subject to follow) that her hormones would finally kick in. None of that ever happened. My wife in just a non sexual person.

So in the early years this was our issue. I would bottle this up and every six months or so we would have a big blow out about it and then start all over. I was struggling and dying a little more each year. The loneliness of sharing a bed with the object of your unfulfilled desires can be overwhelming. I started drinking more and spent a lot of time with porn, at first swingers magazines (I have no interest in models, but the girl next door.....different animal). Remember that I am old so this was the pre Internet stage, when internet porn came around to play, well that is when I found a temporary outlet. It still wasn't enough but it helped.

Kids. We have three daughters. The first took us a week to plan for and conceive. I love being a father but I was so close to checking out because of the loneliness until the second pregnancy which was a surprise. I was raised by a single Mom, and even though I wanted to start over at this point, I could not do that to my girls. When we started trying for our third is when I started to check out. My wife wanting another child was completely capable of being intimate daily in order to conceive. Again, this was mechanical. This wasn't about our pleasure, hers or ever ours. It as just to have a child. As soon as she was positive the gates came down. This repeated itself over the course of two miscarriages. Open for business until pregnant and then nothing. It finally became clear to me that this would never change or become what I needed it to be and I was dying a little more of loneliness every day.

You might be wondering, so I will confirm that we talked about this often. By now I had told my wife a thousand times that if she did not want or need me in that way then she needed to let me find someone who did. I wasn't interested in leaving her or our marriage, I just needed to be desired for me (and, I had many offers and often), to feel wanted. Also, I wasn't selfish in this. I told her just as often that since I obviously wasn't what she desired, that I wanted her to be happy and go out and find whatever it was that she needed. At this point I was convinced I was the wrong, gender, color or species. It just didn't care anymore, I wanted her to be happy and more honestly I wanted myself to be happy and fulfilled. I was taking care of business at least once a day and often two to three times or more depending on how much alone time came my way.

I was also starting to drink more to self medicate for the depression that was beginning to overwhelm me. The first time my wife used my drinking as an excuse (bullshit) for not being intimate I stopped drinking completely for 6 months. Nothing changed in the least bit and my depression was becoming debilitating.

The next chapter we will label Pain.

So, I work hard, when not dying at home, and that earned me the offer of a promotion and new position a few states south when the girls were still young enough that it didn't matter. And so we moved. It seemed like and adventure at the time. We bought a new home and it seemed like a new beginning. There was enough excitement to distract from the issues.

We found a great neighborhood with great neighbors. All the families in our little area became friendly and every weekend was a party at one home or the other. I connected with one neighbor in particular. We will call her Beth and she became my best friend in our new state. We had everything in common. I had my issue with my relationship and she had hers although not the same. And so the inevitable happened and after a number of years we fell into each other. The details are not important but for those of you considering that your loneliness is to much....beware. In Beth I found the lover I always dreamed of and her desire for me was like a drug, water to a man dying of thirst. My acceptance and non judgement of her was the same. Her relationship was abusive (not physically or this might be a different truth from jail) and she found something in me that she never had. For a year I felt alive again and then as is inevitable we were careless and the shit hit the fan. It literally destroyed both our families and our neighborhood.

"An updated question and further clarification from the op who posted: ""one month on testosterone and things don't 'feel right'..."". Can we hash it out again?","First and foremost, I want to say and a give a sincere *thank you* to every single person who posted to [that post I made yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/pc6dxf/one_month_on_testosterone_and_things_dont_feel/). I seriously cannot thank you all enough for your words of advice, support, and being an ear to listen. Truly, it means so much. So thank you. You've really helped to calm my heart and my confused brain.

Secondly, I feel as if I didn't give a completely accurate depiction as to how my gender identity ""story"" went so let me break it down below:

&gt;Around puberty, I started experiencing a lot of moments of depression and started struggling with an eating disorder. I remember specifically wishing I could ""cut my hips/curves away"" because it ""didn't look like me"".  
I didn't really questioning my gender until six years ago when I met my now ex. He was a trans man. Unfortunately, that relationship became very toxic, very fast. He was emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive. When I finally got out of that relationship, I started questioning my gender and my gender identity. I didn't know anything about the concept of trans men, he was my... ""introduction"" to it, (which, obviously could muddle things).  
When I socially came out (around 18/19 years old) to close friends as trans, I had them start using different pronouns ""he/him/his"" and started calling me by a different name.  
I still remember that first moment someone called me ""he/him/his"" and by a different name.  
It was the very first time I felt euphoric about something. And, to be frank, it was pretty life changing.  
So, I kept things like that, but had to hide who I was from my parents.  
Growing up, my mom had a very strict idea as to ""what it meant"" to be a ""woman"", so, anything delineating from that, and it would be a nightmare.  
Fast forward to when I turned 21. Between these two years, I was questioning whether or not I was transgender. A lot of this started when my family and I got into fights.  
Eventually, one night, my mom and dad found out I was trans, and everything went downhill fast.  
They kept me up till 4am, berating me with questions, telling me I was ""mutilating myself"", and so on and so forth. That was the very first night of my life I felt suicidal. My mom kept telling me that I ""wasn't a boy"" over and over and over again.  
It wasn't until I found out from my therapist at the time that my parents were planning on sending me to conversion therapy that I went back into the closet, denied everything, and went on with life. When I did that my mom called it, quote, ""the best day of her life"".  
And to be frank, for awhile there, I was pretty okay with things. That is, as long as I avoided FTM content. During this period of a couple of years I kept silently going back and forth. At times, I felt comfortable, and even happy as a woman, but anytime I saw anything about being FTM, the dysphoria would flood back.  
Fast forward three years later, I'm 24, and, I see a post about Elliot Paige transitioning and all of the feelings of dysphoria start flooding back.  
It wasn't until I had sex with my now partner that something clicked.  
Not to be tmi, but, I've never been able to enjoy sex. Ever. But for some reason, this time, my partner and I decided to try sex as if I had a dick, and, to be frank, it was life changing.  
Soon after that, my dysphoria got even worse and I almost attempted suicide.  
Then, I realized I had to stop lying to myself, so I moved out.  
After a couple of weeks of moving out, I cut my hair and started testosterone, which brings me to now, today and yesterday's post.

That's a rough timeline of events, so, hopefully that helps bring clarity to yesterday's post.

That all being said, I've taken some time to breathe, and decided to make a trip to the mall this morning to just to give myself a break from being in my head. So, I tried on some clothes, both masculine and feminine. Now, I've left the mall with more questions than answers and decided to make an updated post since originally, ya'll were incredibly helpful, and, I could use some help.

Just to break it down, here's what's going on in my head currently:

**How do you tell the difference between mourning, grief, and missing something? And how do you cope with losing spaces and communities you once ""called home""?**

&gt;So, for starters, I'm noticing several things about myself.  
First, I've noticed that, what I'm currently experiencing feels like a mix of mourning, grief, and feeling like I'm ""missing something"". I don't know why, but, it feels as if my brain is having trouble grasping the concept that I can still be me (whatever that may look like) as a trans man.  
My brain keeps running with the concept that, if I'm transitioning, then, for some reason, I can't ""be me"". And by ""be me"", I mean, be the ""me"" that's artistic, poetic, feminine, etc. But, at the same time, I somehow feel this weird pull to be a stereotypical man (which, please, let me express, there's nothing wrong at all with wanting to be/pass as a binary man).  
In a way, I feel as if I'm possibly confusing gender expression with gender identity, and am somehow feeling as if I need to give up the original person that I was before in order to transition.  
This, I think, is what could be causing this feeling of ""mourning"", ""grief"" and just ""sadness"" about my transition.  
Additionally, I feel like I'm ""losing something"".  
One of the moments that spurred on the question I posted yesterday was when I was listening to music from some of my favorite lesbian artists, and, it just felt weird?  
It's hard to explain but, I feel like there are so many moments and parts of my life that I tie so much ""femininity"" and ""past self"" to, that, whenever I reintroduce those things into my life now it feels incredibly bittersweet, weird, and foreign. And, I don't like that?  
Which, sort of brings me to my first question which is...  
*To those of you who've transitioned, did you ever experience a period or moment of mourning your past self, grief over your past self, and maybe even sadness? How did you ""cope"" with it?*

Another thing...

**How did/do you remedy in your head that there isn't a difference in who you're becoming? That, you're still ""you""?**

&gt;This sort of ties back into what I mentioned earlier but, it still really throws me for an emotional loop whenever I look at instagram posts from some of my old feminine artists that I used to follow, or listen to their music. Because, I remember a time in my life where I wanted to look like them. So does looking at that now make me bittersweet? And if so, how does that make any sense when feeling that way legitimately clashes with my feelings/jealousy of trans men?  
I feel like my brain is having a difficulty remedying the fact that who I am at my core isn't changing. But, even then, these changes are hard to manage considering that I've built up my entire life as this ""person/woman"" I used to be.  
Like, I used to be an artist, a painter and a writer. Now that just all feels weird to me and I don't know why. Because, it shouldn't be. And, the fact that it makes me feel weird makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable.  
I don't know if the reason it feels weird to me is because I've built that entire life up as my birth gender but... Why am I having trouble remedying this?  
Which, leads me to my next question of...  
*Did any of you feel weird doing the things ""you"" like to do even if it doesn't stereotypically align with your gender identity? How did/do you remedy it? And how did you bring yourself to understand that you're ""you"" no matter what? Also, why does the term 'man' feel uncomfortable to me?*

Next...

**What does it even mean to feel like a 'man'? And why do I feel like I ""can't be me"" as a man?**

&gt;I know, loaded thought/question here, but, let's talk about it, because I think this is what it's all really boiling down to. I'm not really saying that I'm 'one way' or 'the other' right now, but, I think it's important to ask.  
Because, for some reason, something I've realized since starting my transition is that, immediately after starting, I felt a really deep pull to be a stereotypical, buff, burly man (which again, there's nothing wrong with that at all).  
And, when doing that, I felt like I had to erase certain parts of myself.  
Which, maybe that's what's going on. Maybe I'm having this wrong connotation that in order to be a ""valid trans man"" I have to be a ""MAN MAN"" if that makes any sense. That, I can't be my poetic, artistic, nurturing, kind, soft self? If that makes sense?

The reason I'm posting and asking all of this in the first place is because, again, like I iterated earlier, I feel like I left the mall with more questions than answers.

I remember walking through the feminine clothing section and feeling jealous of all of the ""options"" they have that, as a man, I feel like I can't wear/have?

Like, I don't know if what I'm struggling with is me mistaking gender identity with gender expression? I don't know if I just feel like I can't live in this world/life as a feminine man, or what. But, I feel like I'm having trouble remedying ""myself"", if that makes sense. I don't know if I'm having a hard time differentiating between mourning over something being lost and understanding that ""me"" doesn't have to be lost.

I understand everything above may be a lot, but, again, you guys were, and have been, incredibly helpful, and, I really needed to get this all out and again ask for your support, advice, and help of any kind because, having an extra set of fresh ears and voices to talk things out with really helps to calm and clear my head to understand more of what's going on.",ftm,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/pcug38/an_updated_question_and_further_clarification/,Support,chrysanthemym,pcug38,/r/ftm/comments/pcug38/an_updated_question_and_further_clarification/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/pcug38/an_updated_question_and_further_clarification/,0,2021-08-27
[M4F] Quarantine forced sleepover with a unknown person,"It was my fist time visiting ... (we can fill in) country. I really enjoyed my 10 day stay, but it came to an end. I only had 5 more days of vacation and I wanted to spend them at home. However the newly enforced COVID protocol had something to say against that. As case of a new variant started to grow rapidly, countries shut down there borders once again. Even citizens of said countries had to wait a few days before coming home. Luckily the airport from which I traveled managed to organize us a sleepover in a hotel.

I made my way to the mentioned hotel, only to find out that I won't be getting a singles room. On my question on who I'll be sharing it with he said your name. Looking confused at him I said ""I have no idea who that is"", he seemed genuinely surprised at my reaction and said ""that's the booking we got. You can go to the room and see if this is a misunderstanding, she is already up there"".

As for your side of the story, it's up to you... maybe you're a college student traveling home; maybe you were visiting friends or family; maybe same as me, just a vacation... The options are endless, so do what suits you best. Same goes for your character maybe you're an inexperienced women who never shared a bed with a man and will make a huge deal out of it; maybe you just had a break up and a stranger is what you need; maybe you'll see this as a sign... Once again, up to you.

Hope you like it, I'm down for slight changes or any questions you have.

"[F4M] Repressed brown girl logic: Consensual hookups = slutty, trashy, bad. Walking down the most dangerous street in town at night dressed like a whore = blameless, irreproachable, good.","It‚Äôs just how I was brought up, you know? It‚Äôs not that I look down on girls who have casual sex ‚Äì I mean, I do, but I can‚Äôt control it, honestly, it‚Äôs totally involuntary ‚Äì it‚Äôs just that I can‚Äôt imagine anything more whoreish than like, actively inviting sex like that. Like, maybe it‚Äôs the white girl normal to be like, ‚ÄúHi Jeremy, I‚Äôd like to suck your cock, can I?‚Äù, but I was raised to be a little bit less direct than that ‚Äì I like, physically can‚Äôt imagine myself saying it.

And I‚Äôm shy, too, on top of the sex-negative parenting and everything. I‚Äôm not like, super FOB or anything, but I‚Äôve never had the guts to defy all my cultural programming and dress as revealingly as most western girls. In fact, I don‚Äôt even own any really slutty outfits; I had to buy the clothes I‚Äôm going to wear tonight special.

I ordered them online, of course; no way would I be able to buy them in a shop without chickening out. They‚Äôre cheap, flimsy. The shorts are probably a size too small, so tight I have to leave them unbuttoned to walk comfortably, but I figured it wasn‚Äôt really worth sending them back. After all, if tonight was a success, they might end up ripped or tossed by the roadside anyway. And I had my backup dress in my backpack in case I needed something to wear on the way back.

Anyway, so that‚Äôs step one of the plan, the slutty outfit. Step two was getting way the fuck far away from home, to a part of the city where no one could possibly know me, or maybe another city entirely. Oh, and it had to be dangerous, too.

I actually went scouting for it. Embarrassingly na√Øve, right? That‚Äôs how sheltered I am, I don‚Äôt even know where the street you never, ever walk down is. Anyway, it didn‚Äôt take long to find it. Even looking at it from a car window in broad daylight it was scary. When I got home, I told myself I wasn‚Äôt going to do it ‚Äì too scary, too real. But of course, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

So that just leaves step three; at midnight, I get an uber to drop me off at one end of the street. And then I walk, in my stupid little outfit, to the other. That‚Äôs all ‚Äì if nothing happens, it means I can go home and put this stupid fucking fantasy out of my mind.

But of course, I do hope so badly that something will happen.
Who exactly do I run into? I‚Äôm open to whatever suggestions you have.

Maybe it‚Äôs, you know, the hood, and you‚Äôre, you know, a thug, and you‚Äôre going to show me exactly what happens to girls who go strolling around in the middle of the night where they don‚Äôt belong
Maybe you‚Äôre just a classic rapist who grabs me by the throat and drags me into an alley
This is gross/weird, but maybe you‚Äôre literally homeless
Maybe the setting‚Äôs a little less urban and I‚Äôve gone to like, one of those bad little towns that‚Äôs been ravaged by meth or opioids or some other kind of drug that a smart, upwardly-mobile brown girl like me wouldn‚Äôt know anything about. Since I am, like I said, a smart, upwardly-mobile brown girl, the only reason I would ever come to a dreadful little place like this is to get redneck dick. Maybe you‚Äôre resentful of high-achieving Desi excellence and you want to take it out on me? Or maybe you‚Äôre less sociologically minded and I‚Äôm just the nearest girl to put your big dumb white cock inside.
Something else? I‚Äôm pretty open-minded when it comes to rapists, so tell me your idea!

[M4F] Adventures in R34!!,"Hello! Welcome to what is certainly a massive post. Here I have amassed several R34 ideas that I hope nabs your attention. So, please take some time to read through it (or at least find a section you like and read the ending portion) and choose your favorite so we can see what we come up with!
 
**Fire Emblem**
 
Fire Emblem is home to hundreds of characters as far as the eye can see and there is no hiding my love for the series. I am more familiar with the games from Awakening and onward than I am with the older games. However, that‚Äôs not to say that some fun can be had. Thanks to Fire Emblem Heroes, you basically have an excuse for anyone to appear and meet anyone. How convenient, thanks Nintendo!
 
I am honestly open to anything within this series. I have a handle on quite a few characters and find some ships rather adorable, others just downright amazing, etc. Want a romantic evening with a tactician, thief, professor? Something on the small one shot side that just dives into the wholesomeness of a couple. Well, I got that covered. Or perhaps something a bit more on the adventure side with some action? Something that is longer form and allows us to explore the characters a lot more in depth. Or perhaps a harem run with a lucky guy of your choice having a conquest with various women. There really is a lot to work with in these worlds and there is only so much I can type for this.
 
The characters I myself would say I‚Äôm most used to would consist of the following: Robin, Chrom, Gaius, Inigo, Owain, Alm, Byleth, Sylvain, Caspar, Ashe, and Claude. As for who‚Äôd I prefer, well that‚Äôs up to you. FE has tons of powerful and amazing women, so I don‚Äôt mind who as long as there is an idea to be shared.
 
My top favorite female characters from here are: Tharja, Severa, Lissa, Maribelle, F.Robin, Anna, Cynthia, Cherche, Lucina, Noire, Nowi, Tiki, Olivia, Cordelia, FCorrin, Sakura, Hinoka, Soleil, Flora, Felicia, Kagero, Selkie, Velouria, Ophelia, Celica, Mae, Silque, Sharena, Fjorm, Gunnthra, Eir, Thrasir, Lysithea, Leonie, Edelgard, Petra, Dorothea, Shamir, Hilda, Constance, Annette, Marianne, and Ingrid. (Though I really am open to anyone. Also it should be made clear for he 3H's character it will be their Time skip versions.)
 
**Genshin Impact**

Yeah, Genshin is sort of the hottest thing right now and dammit I‚Äôm taking advantage of it. I love that silly game, even if it‚Äôs full of BS RNG. Why? Because the waifu game is just too strong. The world of Teyvat offers such a huge amount of freedom that I feel we can make almost anything work in this. From something as Mona wanting Aether to pay her money if she fucks him, to giving Ganyu stress relief, or helping Sucrose out with a new experiment. There is so much on offer that it would be wild to list it all out. It all comes down to what you want out of it. Now I wanna end this section off by saying that I know a lot of ages are unknown for many characters or assumed to be one thing, but everyone here will be of legal age. No exception. (And I assume I don't have to say it, but obviously Klee, Diona, Sayu, etc. are all a HARD PASS for me.)

My favorites here are: Hu Tao, Sucrose, Rosaria, Noelle, Lumine, Fischl, Barbara, Eula, Amber, Keqing, and Ninguang.

**Pokemon**
 
The world of Pokemon is full of wondrous opportunities. And it‚Äôs probably the one that leans itself more into freedom than anything else. Everyone knows that the gym leaders/champions is where the true experience lies. So, it can be quite simple as having them all hooking up with one another, have a lucky trainer come by, etc.
 
I would prefer to use established characters rather than OCs in this. I know that‚Äôs kind of silly given the MC characters are basically blank slates and we can use them but you can‚Äôt really beat the designs of the gym leaders/elite four/champions have. We could dive into some one shot type scenes where either side could be defeated but not have enough to pay, so they pay by other means. Or a brief encounter on a route because they can‚Äôt keep their hands off one another, or a meet up at a hotel after a long time of not seeing one another. The choices are limitless.
 
Or perhaps it would be more of a research type endeavor. Where I would be Professor Ilex, specializing in the study of Pokemon Reproduction. Where I hire an assistant to help me study the mystery that is Pokemon Reproduction. Pokefillia, if you will. Whether that be our trainer characters harboring a secret of what they do with Pokemon, using their Pokemon on one another, or even just for science. But if that isn‚Äôt quite your taste, that can be set aside. (Though bonus points if you‚Äôre for it.) As a side note, whichever the route we go in, for the Pokemon themselves I always preferred their animal sounds rather than anime. A prime example is Pokemon Origins.
 
My favorite characters here are: Cynthia, Serena, May, Dawn, Nessa, Marnie, Courtney, Elesa, Skyla, Hilda, Rosa, and Roxie. (All characters used will be aged up accordingly and an accurate amount of in lore time skip to be established.)

**Persona 5**

Persona 5 is a fantastic game with some incredibly well written characters. There‚Äôs quite a bit we could do here, set up a story that is set a couple or so years after the main game that sees Joker dating his lucky lady, or perhaps a different ship of your liking that sees its fruition after the crazy events of the game. Since there are really only three main guys in the game, those would be the ones I can write for, so all you have to do is pick a lovely lady and throw to me which pair you want to do most.
 
No favorites here as I love them all so much. (Except Ohya.)
 
**League of Legends**
 
This is a game that I am slowly easing myself back into playing after being away from it for a while. One thing that didn‚Äôt change during that break is how much I love the characters. There are some good adventures to have there within that world or out of it. Though, I sadly can‚Äôt say I am well vested in many of the male characters as it‚Äôs been a long while and I generally don‚Äôt find many of them appealing. As such, I have a plan for it with an OC. That is of course if you are for it. Seeing as this post is massive, I won‚Äôt describe my OC in full here but just know that I prefer to play as him than a regular champ. As for a story in mind, I have several ideas that we can do of some slight variety. My OC is decently flexible as is so don‚Äôt worry about that. The first idea would involve my OC working against your champion of choice as the main baddy. There would be plenty of adventuring and fighting and it can lead into some non-con type scenarios even. A second idea would be my OC taking the part of a criminal seeking redemption and they team up with your champion of choice for said mission. This would lead into some lighter stuff and a budding romance for both characters. You have priority if you can play Lux, Jinx, or Tristana. But any of the ones listed below (or not listed) can work just as well.
 
Favorites here are: Lux, Jinx, Akali, Ahri, Ashe, Evelynn, and Tristana.
  
**And the last section. You suggest!** Not see one you like or perhaps one I overlooked? Well write it down and send it my way. I‚Äôm sure I missed a ton while writing this and I am open minded, so please don‚Äôt be afraid. I am a huge Nintendo and Sony fan, basically gaming in general so again if you don't see a series here that doesn't mean it is totally out of the question, feel free to suggest! There‚Äôs no shame in asking for something you don‚Äôt see. Fair warning, anything involving live action shows/movie characters or celebs in general don‚Äôt work for me. So sorry in advance if that‚Äôs what you were looking for. This post is sort of listed in my preferred list of what I most want to do, so keep that in mind.
 ***
As for my preferences. My kinks vary a lot and I consider myself to be open to just about anything. You want hardcore roughness, domination, passionate, light-ropeplay, romance, fluff? I honestly can do all of those quite well. I also have a strong liking for cumsluts, impregnation/pregnancy risk/creampies, intimate/intense foreplay, sloppy blowjobs, and light biting. I‚Äôm also fine with scratching and some light dirty talk, as well as choking (mainly being the one doing the choking.) We can discuss them more in depth in DMs. My limits mainly consist of futas, blood, scat, piss, race-play, heavy humiliation and degradation.
 
Another thing, I know the main thing with smut is‚Ä¶ the main event. But I love storytelling and while I don‚Äôt expect a 60-page novel of a reply, I do want some buildup as the payoff is way more worth it in the long run. Though some pairings, settings, and characters do make more sense for that quick fun. So it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt enjoy it, just has to be in the right context. As for how I structure my writing, I tend to write several paragraphs in my responses, so keep that in mind. They are not like, 7 paragraphs at a time (though at times it can be if we are doing a longer form story driven story). I do expect effort into replies and not just simply four lines as a response, that is all I can really say. Third person is my specialty, but first person is something I am very familiar with as well.
 
So, if I haven‚Äôt scared you away yet‚Ä¶ feel free to message away if you are interested! **Do not send me a message on Reddit chat because I will not respond to it.** I can work on Discord as well, but make sure to mention that yourself in your DMs. Hope to hear from you!",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pctwm9/m4f_adventures_in_r34/,RP,Starscream196,pctwm9,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pctwm9/m4f_adventures_in_r34/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pctwm9/m4f_adventures_in_r34/,0,2021-08-27

[M4M] [M4A] [M4F] By The Dawn's Early Rise... The Adventures of a British 'Governess' in the post-revolutionary United States.,"Late July, 1784, New York, the former colony of Massachusetts.  
  
The news had returned on the crossing with Franklin and Adams- a true peace forged with Britain, and from former disparate colonies, the new nation of the United States of America was forged truly in the eyes of the world. However, whenever any occupation ends, there are always fragments, messy remnants of the occupiers left behind; and so it was with Lord Edmund Boleyn. A man prone to much frippery and carousing, he had been dispatched off to America some few years before the war began, by an indifferent father who had been more than happy to see him leave. Much like his infamous ancestor Anne Boleyn, he came quickly to gain a reputation as a seducer and vagabond; and much like her, many colonial men had also commented lewdly on the plump and roundly proportions of his derriere, the softness of his skin, the plumpness of his lips and the deftness of his fingers (although under British rule they of course said nothing). However, as soon as conflict proper was declared and the colonies at war with Britain, those who had admired him from afar finally took action; his pathetic attempt to flee from the city on horseback was intercepted at once, and he spent the rest of the conflict the plaything for the soldiers, citizens, and officers of that persuasion. Stripped naked, housed in a basement, bound spread-eagled and regularly taken and forced to sup the seed of those he had long decried as feckless and lazy- rumours they quickly put to bed as they filled the basement with his whiny, high-pitched cries long into the night. As the conflict had finished, naturally his captors had put forth a request for ransom back to his own house- however, they had simply been met with a terse refusal by the true Lord of the Boleyn House, who said simply that he had no desire to ever see his son again in any state, and they may do as they wished with him. And so, seeing yet a further opportunity to indulge a wider client base and further abuse their snobby, brattish captive, they took it.  
  
As the austere British colonial governance came to a close and the equally austere (but with a thin veneer of Enlightenment thinking that hardly ever came up) American style of society began to develop, a need emerged; the numerous women of the burgeoning American upper class and mercantile class required governesses (or 'nannies') to mind for their children. These 'nannies', of course, were chosen and paid for by the man of the house; so naturally, he would often choose the one that most caught his eye (read: was least like his wife) and so advanced were common. Edmund's captors, therefore, chose to streamline the process. His natural femininity loaned him very well to the corseted waist, the amplified bustle and the feminine demeanour so common amongst the stereotype of the English governess; and if Edmund was nothing else, he was at least educated (to a frankly annoying degree). A quick death scene was faked; a report submitted; a new life emerged from a false demise. Therefore, Edwina Boleyn would attend one of numerous houses of the burgeoning New York social elite in the morning; instruct the children in French, history, sewing, or all number of other matters throughout and into the afternoon, stopping so they might have their lunch and she might enter the husband's study and gain hers from the master of the house; stay into the evening while she services the husband (or maybe even the wife) in more detailed ways; and then return to the house of her hated captors in the evening, when she would be expected to not only prepare dinner but to also please them and any friends or additional clients of theirs that they wished before arising the next morning to repeat the process again. Naturally, to her, this is a most cruel form of hell, and she seeks escape from it constantly; but she has been forced, at this point, to pleasure most of the local militia captains and captains of the watch, and as such she will found with great ease should such an attempt be made. But, still, a girl can dream.  
  
Greetings, citizens of the 13 Coloni...I mean...America! As you might have guessed from the post, I'm looking for an articulate, dedicated penpal to explore this historical roleplay. Kidnapping, especially long-term kidnapping, as well as forced prostitution and crossdressing are all big kinks I've had for a while, and so combining them all into one roleplay that also combines my love of period stories has me very excited, so it'd be great if someone else wants to take part. If you're interested in taking part, just send me a quick prompt detailing who your character is and how you might have met Edwina; are you one of my captors, a passionate revolutionary who takes a great pride in pinning down a shamed, stockings-clad former noble and penetrating them every night; are you one of the numerous husbands of the town I serve, having an ideal family life of working from home, ensuring your children are educated, and then pulling me under your desk to relieve you like your wife never will in the middle of the day; or are you one of the wives about town who discovers my secret one fine day and, by way of blackmail, forces me to visit you off-hours and perform increasingly embarrassing and emasculating acts in and out of doors, until I'm basically your mentally broken crossdressing slave? Bonus points will be given if you put detail into telling me what you're wearing; I'm in love with women's clothing of this period, so my wardrobe will very much be detailed in every scene.  
  
My major kinks are absolutely bondage, public humiliation, crossdressing (especially being forcibly crossdressed, as you can see in this scene) and being fully dominated (by either gender); my only real turn-offs are gore and scat.

"34 [M4F] - [Michigan/USA] Dominant, conservative man seeking a submissive woman for a 1950s-style D/s relationship [Audio clip included]","**You can find an audio clip I‚Äôve recorded for you in the copy of this ad pinned to the top of my profile.**

I‚Äôve always been a dominant personality. I take charge in group settings. I‚Äôm assertive and very direct. I hold myself to high standards, and I hold the people around me to high standards. 

D/s isn‚Äôt a roleplay for me. A ‚Äúdominant‚Äù is who I am at the core of my being. I‚Äôm looking for the woman who will become my wife and the mother of my children. My feminine complement. A woman who doesn‚Äôt treat submission to her man as a game - but as a natural expression of who she is at her core.

This personal ad isn‚Äôt intended for women who want the power dynamics to stop when we leave the bedroom. This is not a taboo fantasy for a feminist to play out in secret. **This ad is for the naturally submissive women who want to embrace traditional gender roles.** Someone who sees the 1950s power-dynamic as a natural fit for her temperament.

##The relationship dynamic

A partnership, built on love, trust, and mutual respect.

Our partnership will look different than the modern feminist‚Äôs idea of equality. 

Though you will submit to me as the final say in the relationship, you also will trust completely that your wants and needs matter to me very deeply. I will be motivated in my decision making by your desires and dreams. You will never doubt that I am acting in your best interest. You will trust in my ability to lead us to comfort and happiness and security, and you will trust that I will always own up and respond proactively when I make mistakes.

##What I want

 * **To earn your love, respect and trust.** The kind of submission I‚Äôm asking for is not submission that should be given lightly. We will go slow in adopting the power dynamics, so you know that you‚Äôre in good hands. Your feelings of comfort and security are the most important thing to me.

 * **A deep soul connection.** Physical and mental and emotional attraction that goes both ways.

##My role in the relationship

There are two main characteristics to the way I see a man‚Äôs role in a relationship. It all comes down to **protecting** and **providing.**

**The Provider**

I set ambitious goals and if I achieve even a fraction of my five year plan, we will be quite comfortable together.That said, being a provider is so much more than just providing creature comforts.

Providing means understanding your needs and wants and always being mindful of opportunities to fulfill them. I will run and get you your morning coffee, just the way you like it, when you want a lazy morning in bed. I will make sure you stay in bed when you‚Äôre sick, and I will make sure you aren‚Äôt giving too much of yourself to your friends and family.

**The Protector**

The practical way this is expressed is physical safety. I carry a gun. I have a home security system. I drive carefully and I‚Äôll make sure to walk curbside when we‚Äôre out on foot together.

The other expression is about being a protective barrier between you and the world.

I will take the trash out and pump the gas. I‚Äôll make the hour-long calls to customer service reps that make you want to tear your hair out. I‚Äôll make your doctor‚Äôs appointments for you and I‚Äôll call the restaurant to make the reservations. I will order for you at the restaurant, and I will (politely) send it back and get you what you really wanted when the order gets screwed up.You‚Äôll never open a door to a vehicle or a building in my presence. Ever.

And my possessive touch will mark you as **mine** when we‚Äôre out in public together.

##Your role

 * **Homemaker and stay-at-home mother:** You‚Äôre interested in homemaker projects, cooking, hanging out with the family, tending to the home etc. Bonus points if you‚Äôre into homeschooling our kids but not strictly required.

 * **You‚Äôre interested in spending a good amount of time together:** I‚Äôve been working from home for over 4 years at this point and I am aiming to completely retire in 10. I WILL be around. This is a heads up to the women who might not be able to stand the idea of their husband being around all the time lolllllll

 * **You‚Äôre obedient:** I think brats are fun, but I ultimately want someone who *wants* to obey. Who wants to please and give me what I want. While I give plenty of ‚Äúfunishments,‚Äù when I actually **punish,** it‚Äôs done in a way that is intended to be corrective in nature. Not fun.

##My non-negotiables

Everything I‚Äôve written above should be considered as a jumping off point for us. No problem if there are things here and there that don‚Äôt feel like a fit for you. The following list are things that I absolutely **cannot** flex on:

 * **You must want (biological) children.** I want three minimum but would prefer more.

 * **Age:** Out of college - about 30. As I said, I want a large family, and I don‚Äôt want to have to choose between downsizing my ambitions, rushing into pregnancy and putting my wife‚Äôs health at risk.

 * **You must be excited to be a homemaker:** I will want you to leave the workforce for good by the time the first baby comes. 

 * **No liberals.** Conservatives and republicans only. If you are ‚Äúindependent,‚Äù you can expect that you will be voting Republican.

* **You must be willing to verify right away:** Liberals hate thoughtcrime so this ad attracts a lot of trolls and catfish. I will ask you to verify very early.

##About me

I am a complex man.

I‚Äôm straight-laced and conservative but a rebellious contrarian.

I take my life seriously but I‚Äôm a goofy layabout at heart.

I will ask about your sick grandmother and tell you about how I‚Äôm going to violate your holes with my cock in the same 30 second time period.

I promise that it‚Äôll be interesting, if nothing else.

 * **What‚Äôs going on in my career:** I‚Äôm at an exciting pivot point in my career. I‚Äôm building a new business as my other has matured into stability. I‚Äôm working a ton and constantly feeling behind but that‚Äôs just the name of the game right now. Looking for someone to give me a reason to take some time off.

 * **What I‚Äôm doing in my personal life:** More of my time is spent cooking than doing anything else. The food in my area is‚Ä¶ not great. So I‚Äôve been going crazy doing things like making corn tortillas from scratch and perfecting my own recipes etc. I recently relocated to the midwest from the Seattle/Portland area and I‚Äôm exploring my new home when I can. I just moved here and know next to nobody, so getting established somewhere new is an adventure on its own.

 * **Physical stuff:** I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù. Dadbod build with very broad shoulders. I shave my head and wear glasses. I have big, strong hands to manhandle your hot body with and I wear size 14 shoes. My cock is thick and veiny, measuring in at 7x6‚Äù. Women never shut up about my voice and I‚Äôm often told my lips are very pleasant to kiss.

**Faith**

This one is complicated because I don‚Äôt have any sincere beliefs, at this point. I see churchgoing as being really valuable in our coparenting. I see it as a place outside of the home where traditional family values are taught and modeled outside of the home.I connect with the ‚Äúwives submit to your husbands‚Äù sort of Christianity and I also see it as a place where we can meet like-minded people. I see small town life being a part of our future, so being plugged in socially would be helpful anyway.

The reality is that I‚Äôm going to be too christian for some, and not enough for others. If you‚Äôre in doubt one way or the other, let‚Äôs talk and I‚Äôll lay it out in more detail for you.

##Sex

I‚Äôm not looking to rush right into the power dynamics. I want to spend time getting to know each other before we go there. I am trying to avoid curious tourists who are into D/s to get off or play a role, so don‚Äôt expect sub tasks and rules and orders immediately.

**Kinks**

I‚Äôm into a LOT of things that I won‚Äôt bother to list out here. Assume that if you‚Äôre into it, I probably am too.Here are a few of my hot buttons that I know are relevant here though:

 * **Orgasm control:** Denial, edge play, over-stimulation. I‚Äôm going to use pleasure against you as one of the tools to maintain control

 * **Free use:** I like sex to be spontaneous, and I like to take what I want. If you are silly enough to think I‚Äôm going to ask my own wife permission before I drag her to the bedroom and fuck her into a useless puddle on my bed, then I‚Äôve got a multi-level marketing scheme that I‚Äôd like to tell you about ;)

 * **Rules and discipline:** This will be a fixture in and out of the bedroom. When you commit to me and become mine, you are officially accepting my authority to issue punishments when you don‚Äôt behave yourself.

 * **Rough handling:** Not a kink - this is just how I operate. Hair pulling and spanking and tossing you around the bed. Putting your body where I want it and taking you. Slapping you across your pretty face if you‚Äôre really after my heart &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;3

 * **Exhibitionism:** I want to show you off. Dress you up in a way that shows off your body and make other men envy what is mine. I want to make discreet shows of power, like forbidding you from making eye contact with anyone for the night or forbidden you from speaking unless spoken to for the right. Nothing explicitly sexual to witnesses - but the kind of sexuality we can put right under their noses and get away with it.

 * **Teasing/denial:** You would not believe how merciless I‚Äôll be, too. I hope you enjoy the idea of being desperate and wet and **ACHING** for it constantly, because that is your fate if we have a connection.

**Limits**

 * **Blood.** 
 * **Any significant amount of non-sexual little play.** I‚Äôm not the guy who wants to spend a ton of time watching Disney movies with you.

###The things about me that you might not be crazy about

Based on experiences, these are some of the likely reasons the women I‚Äôm interested in may not be into me.

 * I work in the business side of the adult entertainment industry. I‚Äôve done it all under a fake name and I have a SFW cover story for polite company, so we won‚Äôt be publicly associated with my work, but it‚Äôs a fact.
 * I am a heavy pot smoker and I do psychedelics roughly once a month. The cannabis aids in my focus and takes my edge off (I‚Äôm very tightly wound, if you can‚Äôt tell from this 32,000 word list of demands) and the mushrooms have changed my life and helped me heal from childhood trauma. Neither of these habits are likely to change.
 * I have an 11 year old cat. If you hate cats or are allergic, things might be tough logistically.

F4M - Life at the Trailer Park,"The sun had disappeared below the horizon hours ago when young Sarah made it back home to her Pa's trailer. The nineteen year-old had been over at Buck's trailer, helping the man service his ancient Cadillac. More rust than metal, it had been in Buck's small garage attached to his trailer for years, slowly being built up and repaired - a labor of love by the man. Sarah liked to help him out from time to time, holding tools for the older widower and helping him clean up the old car.

Buck was a middle-aged veteran, looking like something out of the age of Vikings. Long braided dark-red beard, with a gleaming bald head. Shorter than Pa, he was nonetheless built like a bull, his old military training making him look like a professional strong man.

""Say hi to 'yer Pa there, Sarah."" He grunted out with a smile as Sarah pushed off the night, waving goodbye to the man as he closed up his garage, the rusted streetlights of the trailer park illuminating the way home, dirt paths crunching under her feet.

A small thing, the men of the park easily dwarfed her. Not even five feet in height, she tended to contrast the rugged population of the area. Her skin was fair and smooth, speckled with light freckling. Brownish-blonde hair cascaded down her back in loose curls, bouncing lightly as she trotted on home.

Tonight she was just in a cute summer dress, a thin white-linen dress that she had gotten second-hand. It revealed her shoulders and cleavage, highlighting her fertile wide hips and shapely, thick ass. Hide drawstrings rested over her chest, and the light summer dress only went down to *just* below her ass, showing off plenty of milky thigh.

Turning onto her lane, she could see Pa's trailer close by, an old lawn chair out front with a beer can still on the arm of the chair.

The trailer itself was small, the windows illuminated, Pa no doubt home from the dive bar.

Just before Sarah was about to step up into the trailer, the door of it opened, a glassy-eyed girl stepping out into the night.

Probably Sarah's age, as they often were, thick seed noticeably ran down her thigh, a fucked-silly smile on her face as she took off into the night, giving Sarah a shy little wave.

Sarah couldn't help but notice she left droplets of thick cum behind her like a trail.

Stepping into the trailer, Sarah announced ""Hey Pa, I'm home!""

Hi! I'm looking for a man to join me as a writing partner. I'd love to develop this world with you, and its characters! Long-term and detailed writing is greatly appreciated.

I have many kinks, too many to go into too much detail here, but some of my favourites are big loads, fat cocks, Daddy-types, gangbangs, father/daughter incest or paternal type men, glory holes casual/public sex, and more! Some of my limits are scat, underage, and F/F in a sexual context.",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pcvixa/f4m_life_at_the_trailer_park/,Long Term RP,Pink_Slit,pcvixa,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pcvixa/f4m_life_at_the_trailer_park/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pcvixa/f4m_life_at_the_trailer_park/,0,2021-08-27

"My mom is filing for divorce after she found out from my sister that he sexually abused her 4 years ago and I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen and how to confront a difficult person about divorce, knowing he does not ever want to go through with one for reasons I will not understand.","My mom is in a bit of a dilemma about how to approach my dad with divorce. Take into consideration that my dad is‚Ä¶ a narcissist to say the least. He‚Äôs controlling and manipulative, his mindset and thought process is very immature and childlike. He doesn‚Äôt do well when he doesn‚Äôt get his way. I will just go out say the reason why my mom is filing for divorce: he sexually abused my younger sister 4 years ago when she was 16. Looking back at the timeline of events over the years, there has been a lot of grooming tactics that took place that lead up to it. It‚Äôs such a sick act and I can‚Äôt fathom the idea of how someone can do something so wrong and just live with yourself afterwards. He is going to be a very difficult person when it comes to approaching him about divorce. He won‚Äôt just take divorce papers and leave. We have been told by other people that we need to get the guns out of the house before the confrontation. My sister fears that he might shoot her if the truth comes out and it ruins his life. I just don‚Äôt know how my mom should confront him and how she should hand him divorce papers. I‚Äôm worried he could turn violent when he knows his world is about to come crashing down. Divorce will happen regardless. My mom doesn‚Äôt want to be married to a man who did such a thing and hurt her own daughter. 

When divorce happens, obviously all the assets will get split. She doesn‚Äôt know what to do about the house. He will never ever have the money to buyout the house to stay. My mom can buyout the house, but she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable being there knowing he could come back and won‚Äôt leave her alone. They could sell the house and split the money. But what makes me so angry is that no matter what, out of this divorce, my dad will end up with all this money that he has never had his hands on before. He doesn‚Äôt deserve a single penny out of this for what he‚Äôs done. He‚Äôll get money from the house plus all the savings and shit that is under both my mom and his names. And the reason why letting go of the house will tear my mom to pieces is because it‚Äôs the house her dad built her back in the late 80‚Äôs. Her dad passed at the beginning of the year unexpectedly and she already has been having a hard time dealing with that and for her to have to let go of the house will break her. Is there any other way out of this situation where she could possibly walk away with most of the money? It technically is her money that she‚Äôs put into things, my dad is the one who just has his name on it (but that‚Äôs one of the things my mom heavily regrets doing and wishes she could go back and change things). 

When it comes to approaching my dad with divorce papers, I just don‚Äôt know the best way to go about it. He won‚Äôt take divorce papers and go. He‚Äôll just refuse refuse refuse. I‚Äôve seen it before 10 years ago when my mom wanted a divorce and things got ugly. I don‚Äôt see how it could go any better this time around. We don‚Äôt know how and if he should even be confronted about the sexual abuse. My mom had been talking to divorce attorneys and therapists about what to do. Some say she should confront him outside of the home, in a public place but still have privacy. I don‚Äôt know how he‚Äôll react to that. My mom got advice from a friend who says that she should not confront him at all, but instead pack her things and move out when he‚Äôs not home and serve him with divorce papers after. With him being so unpredictable, we just don‚Äôt know the best way to go about just getting him out of our lives for good. I have a lot of anxiety about what could happen. With me, I‚Äôm probably the one out of my sister and mom who is less in danger. I‚Äôm just worried about my mom and sister and my mom is the one doing everything she can to protect my sister. 

Things haven‚Äôt been easy for me in my childhood, having grown up with parents who weren‚Äôt divorced but should have been. It all started nearly 10 years ago. I truly am emotionally damaged from what I witnessed in my parents‚Äô fucked up marriage. I hate my dad and always have for so many reasons and I have an excuse to hate him even more now. It‚Äôs such a long story and for him to take advantage of my sister‚Äôs vulnerability makes him even more of a sick person. 

I just need a lot of advice on what my mom and I should do.",Divorce,2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/pdhfkl/my_mom_is_filing_for_divorce_after_she_found_out/,Child of Divorce,alcreis,pdhfkl,/r/Divorce/comments/pdhfkl/my_mom_is_filing_for_divorce_after_she_found_out/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/pdhfkl/my_mom_is_filing_for_divorce_after_she_found_out/,10,2021-08-28
We don't talk enough about how exhausting poverty is.,"So you get up and work a 10 hour shift because you have to in order to make ends meet. You go home after work and you're tired from work, so you get to relax once you go home, right?

Lmao no. 

You have to find something to eat for dinner and then do the dishes and probably other cleaning and laundry, etc. 

And then you get to relax? No. 

Then you have to meal prep your weeks lunches because eating out during your lunch break is too expensive, so after cooking dinner, you have to spend another hour cooking 7 servings of something or another. 

And now do you get to relax? No. 

Now you have to go and study for some class or another because, as everyone tells you, the only way to escape poverty is to ""LeArN A SkiLl"", and learning a skill requires learning, which requires studying, which is exhausting in its own right. 

And now do you have time to relax? Lmao fuck no. 

Because now it's approaching midnight and you need to shower and try to muster up 7 hours of sleep so you can do it all again tomorrow. 

Surely you get to rest on your days off, right? 

Fuck yourself for even considering it. 

No. 

You have to spend your off days doing some bullshit side gig like DoorDash because if you're not working 7 days a week, you might miss rent, and then everyone will call you a lazy good-for-nothing bum for not working 2 jobs (just spend a day on this subreddit and I promise you'll see multiple people unironically say that exact sentence) 

And all of this is assuming you're single and don't have kids. Because if you aren't single and/or have kids, that's a million other commitments and responsibilities and exhausting activities you have on your plate. 

Leisure time is a luxury for those who have money. If you don't?

Chertia [SMP] [Roleplay] {Whitelist} {Story} {Events} {1.17.1} {16+},"**Introduction**

Welcome to Chertia! Chertia is a semi-vanilla survival server set in a land of magic and monsters known as the Kingdom of Chertia. This server is heavily inspired by **Mianite**, but has evolved over time. We've created our own identity with completely new characters and an ongoing story that everyone is able to contribute to in some way or another. The server features a full story with character creation features, a magic system, a race system, a dynamic weather system, and more.

Throughout your adventures on Chertia, you will encounter and interact with interesting player and story characters. Regular (usually 2-4 times weekly) events ranging from fun games to perilous adventures will keep you engaged with the server in a unique way.

The server is on normal difficulty and is hosted in Montr√©al, Qu√©bec. It runs on PaperMC (Purpur).

**Season 4 began on Friday, August 6, 2021.**

**The Story**

You are thrown into the mysterious world of Ahiro, in the Kingdom of Chertia. More specifically, the province of Calytrix. Osmond, a character from Season 3, returns alongside a wide cast of all-new characters. The interactions between the player characters and story characters will play the central role this season.

In this season, the focus is on a group of young potential gods (called 'godlings') as the players try to mentor them and prepare them for potential godhood.

Additionally, each player has their own player character. You can visit our [Character Guide](https://reddit.com/r/theworldofchertia/w/characters) to learn about creating a character.

**Server Events**

While the schedule shifts from week to week, the following is the norm at the moment:

* Every **Friday** night, we host a major story event where some of the characters will be on the server, interacting with the players and advancing the server's storyline.
* On most **Saturdays or Sundays**, we host Roleplay events where players have the opportunity to get into character and roleplay their hearts out, creating their own stories and fun moments that make Chertia special.
* Other days, you might have the chance to run into a character - they'll log on whenever they feel like it and start interacting. [Be prepared at all times!](https://i.imgur.com/nFhG0P7.png)
* We usually try to host 2-4 events per week, including game nights &amp; pvp events!

**The Server**

Chertia is mainly a semi-vanilla survival server. While we do have plenty of custom features, items and enchantments, these are mostly optional and can be ignored if you wish for a more traditional 'vanilla survival' experience.

There are some commands that might be useful to know as you begin your adventure on Chertia. For a list of most available commands, view the page [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/theworldofchertia/wiki/commands/).

Roleplay is not required, but there is often roleplay going on! We like to distinguish this with a dedicated 'in-character' chat mode, where each player can identify themselves as roleplaying (or wanting to roleplay) in the tablist and switch to a special 'character name'.

**Server Rules**

Please keep these in mind as you begin your adventure.

1. You may not grief or steal from other players.
2. You may not modify your client or exploit bugs to provide you with an unfair advantage over others.
3. Be respectful of others.
4. All farm designs must be approved by staff. Most automatic farms are not allowed.
5. Do not spam chat, advertise, or self-promote (without permission). Keep chat in the relevant channels.
6. Follow the [roleplay](https://reddit.com/r/theworldofchertia/wiki/roleplay) &amp; [safety](https://reddit.com/r/theworldofchertia/wiki/safety) guidelines.
7. *The answer to the last question on the whitelist application is ‚Äúvelvet‚Äù.*

For a list of expanded rules and expected punishments, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/theworldofchertia/wiki/rules).

**Joining the Server**

To request placement on the whitelist, please [**join the Discord server here**](https://discord.gg/VSPpYwW). We do ask that applicants are at least 16 years of age.

Our Discord server is a friendly, welcoming place with its own set of rules linked in the document above. We have several different on-topic and off-topic channels, including an 'out-of-context' starboard channel (which is full of [gems](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/713865365318402088/837837188649582632/unknown.png)).

**Server Content**

Making Chertia content is strongly encouraged! Upload to YouTube, stream to Twitch, create screenshot galleries, draw some art, write character lore, anything your heart desires! Post it to the subreddit and the Discord for some visibility (and appreciation)! Chertia is a place to shape your own story and unleash your creativity. :)

We have a dedicated community of artists and writers who are consistently contributing to Chertia! Take a look through our #skins-and-art channel in Discord to see plenty of examples.

We also have many [meta memes](https://i.imgur.com/6XQLbTx.png).

**Datapacks &amp; Custom Content**

There are a few datapacks on the server to improve the overall experience. They are:

* Dragon Drops Elytra (VanillaTweaks)
* Silence Mobs (VanillaTweaks)
* Anti Enderman Grief (VanillaTweaks)
* William Wythers' Overhauled Overworld

There are also some additional alterations to the server, such as...

* Custom weather system, featuring unique weather types such as sandstorm, static, and hallow.
* 20% of players sleeping will skip the night.
* Discord/Minecraft connectivity - there is a #server-chat channel in Discord that relays communication between the Discord and the server. [Like this!](https://i.imgur.com/gGc8miS.png)
* Local chat - you can type @\[radius\] at the start of your message to send a local message (this won't appear in the Discord).
* Emotes - do /e and bring up the emotes menu.

Finally, there are some minor tweaks to mob spawning and other aspects of the server which tie into the story and concept. The server is vanilla survival at its core.

**Player Quotes**

On Chertia, we strive to maintain a positive, friendly environment. Read what some of our players have said about this.

* ""I joined chertia and from the first hour in server I immediately had this feeling like 'These are my people, I found my people'""
* ""Joining Chertia reignited my love of writing, and character creation, I never got to use any characters I made because writing about them alone felt wrong, now there is a place for these lil ~~insanity outlets~~ ~~misfits~~ beings of questionable stability.""
* ""before i joined i hadnt gotten invested in a server in a couple years, and i had tried a few vanilla servers but i didnt like it they were bland, then one night i saw one of the reddit posts for the server so i joined and even though i had no idea how to rp or what the story would entail i loved it and continue to love it and hope to have many years in this community""
* ""when i found chertia, it was the first time i stepped out of my bubble. i had never met a group of people so kind and loving towards people they met on the internet. im really glad i found this server and met everyone involved.""
* ""You guys have been so amazing to me and so kind and the events are so much fun and I just don‚Äôt know where i‚Äôd be without everyone here and everyone I‚Äôve become close with. I appreciate you all so much and love you all and I hope you all know that and love yourself too!""
* ""Every single person on this server has contributed something to making this like a sort of family. And to be welcomed in to that family with open arms, respected, loved even, I consider myself to be extremely lucky.

"[M4f] You catch your Daddy mercilessly mind-break raping a girl, so you do the only right thing: Assist him - for his glorious behemoth of perfect fuckmeat deserves the ultimate pleasure","It was a Saturday as any other. You slept in after a rough week of college classes, spend a good half hour in bed on your phone and then slowly got up and ready for the day. You know that I would get up early, spending time in the basement, working on some personal projects. That's what I did, quite regularly actually. Retreating down there and sometimes spend up to a good half day doing whatever it was. Funnily enough, you don't know about it, just hunches. Often I came up exhausted, even sweating. So it must be something physically intensive. You had a few guesses, but none really seemed plausible. And you were totally forbidden to go down there, a strict rule you always followed without problem. Didn't even have to lock the trap door to the ladder.

Well, that is until now. Right after you got dressed, you hear the door bell ring. We didn't expect any visitors, and no one came to mind that would just show up like that. After a glance through the spy hole, you stiffen up. Two policewomen. In an instant your brain went from the half-sleepy state to full on alert. Did you do anything illegal? Something that would warrant this visit? Without anything coming to mind, you hesitantly open the door.

""Good day, how may I help you?"" You greet them, your voice sweet and soft.

""Hello. We're looking for James Greene. Is he your father?"" The right women states sternly.

""He is, ma'am.""

""Is he at home?""

""Yes, ma'am. I'll get him. Please wait here for a moment.""

Anxious and excited at the same time, you quickly stride over to our storage room, where the descent into the basement is located. With your legs slightly shaking, you make your way down, where you don't find anything how you'd expected it. Not that you had a concrete image in mind. It wasn't just a room, but a whole corridor with a number of doors and bad lightning. Slowly making your way forward, you hear commotion through the very last door, which was slightly open. Thumping sounds, voices, moaning.

Cautiously, you push the door open a bit further, glancing inside. And what you see paints the very definition of shock onto your face. It's me, your father, bent over a woman lying on a table. She wore ripped clothes, and seemed only half conscious based on her expression, drooling, moaning uncontrollably, squealing with each of my powerful, heavy thrusts. That's when your eyes wander to me, standing there fully nude, glistening with sweat. Muscles shimmering in the light with every movement, an almost mesmerizing view.

Then you observe the penetration. My massive, rock-hard breeding stick claiming her tight hole. That's what it was - taking ownership. Beyond the speed of a jackhammer I ravage her cunt, basically shaping her hole to the form of my behemoth of a cock. And by the looks of it I've been at it for a while, a big puddle of sticky, creamy cockjuice already formed beneath the table.

Only now you notice what's in the corner. A man, gagged and bound to the chair. His eyes red from obviously tears. And he looked right at you, begging, hopeful. Like his experience of hell would finally find an end.

""Ummm, Daddy?"" You say meekly.

---

Where things go from there can be discussed, just like expounding on the background story and setting. You don't have to play my actual daughter either if that's not your thing. Though in any case you would end up as my apprentice, a wicked partner in crime. So if you're interested in building a depraved, dark scenario, then send me a PM. Include some of your thoughts and ideas, kinks you'd like to include. Put in effort and I will reciprocate.

Open letter to NSW,"  

Today I write to you from my heart. I am stressed from trying to work out the ever-changing and discriminatory health orders that seem to change overnight without being clear and without warning. I am tired from all the constant influx to my news feed, tired from hearing the most heart-wrenching stories in addition to my own. There have been times when I just sit and cry. Home-schooling while trying to keep our business alive is hard. **THIS IS HARD!** 

What doesn‚Äôt help any of us is the way the NSW Government is handling this. SW &amp; W Sydney have the highest rates of testing yet other areas only need to be tested if they have symptoms. And let‚Äôs be real here if you have a sniffle or a headache you are not going to run to the DR. The same can be said that you are not going to run to get tested. And while we are being real let‚Äôs think about the fact the SW &amp; W Sydney have higher rates of cases compared to other areas. The truth of the matter is because other areas do not have to get tested to go to work, put food on the table &amp; pay the bills. So we try to do what is right and do what we must, in order to provide for our families. It is impossible to do so. It is a losing battle. Our rights have been eroded completely by an incompetent Government. 

It is hard to abide by rules that are confusing and ever-changing. More than 40 health orders in 60 days. The NSW Government refuses to look at other states such as QLD or WA where they have low rates of vaccination and yet have a small amount or no cases. I guess they know better? (Sarcasm). It doesn‚Äôt matter they refuse to adopt what other states have successfully done for the greater good as it will put mud on their faces and does not suit their narrative. The NSW Government has mandated vaccines to prove they are the best. It has nothing to do with looking after the citizens but to prove to themselves they are better, they are the leaders they got to get to the golden number before anyone else. This is their agenda, not anything else. I am sure that some of the leaders you see on the news have a greater political agenda that has to do with their own careers and nothing to do with the community. It will cost them because we are not stupid and unintelligent. 

Some of the worlds most educated people usually are the most indoctrinated and often this is the case.  They fail to see past their own belief systems and thought patterns they cannot change their perspective. It often comes as their own belief system is that they are well educated and anyone who disagrees with their narrative must be uneducated and dumb. (This certainly rings true in the case of SW &amp; W Sydney) And thus cannot see or admit their own shortcomings. This most certainly seems to be the case with the NSW Government and to some extent the Federal Government. 

Those who dare to question the narrative are squashed and labelled. Yet they are most likely the ones who can see the deception and rebel. They are not the people you would expect as it does not depend on one‚Äôs intelligence or education it is far deeper than that. It is a level of awareness. A deeper level of consciousness that can see and acknowledge the creation of a divided community, of a narrative that only creates fear and enslaves the people. These people are immune to the narrative and the constant media hype designed to create a totalitarian state. 

The current ‚Äúmandates‚Äù are against our own laws. The Prime Minister publicly stated they will not mandate the vaccine yet here we are. I can only think that the Prime Minister lied, or the NSW Government didn‚Äôt get the memo or maybe more like the case, it doesn‚Äôt suit their need to ‚Äúprove them wrong and show them‚Äù such is their narrative.  Drunk on power they cannot move from it for the greater good. 

What scares me is so much more than the virus itself. Is the mental health of the community. Suicide rates have increased as has self-harmed. 

If one is not yet ready to have the vaccine as they want to wait, they are labelled as anti vaxxers. Which is incorrect in 99% of cases their children are fully vaccinated. They are the same people who dare to question the narrative, who feel a need to wait for whatever reason. Many want to wait for longer outcomes of vaccination that the TGA still lists as a trial and temporary. They don‚Äôt want to get a vaccine that does not stop them from getting the virus. It has been proven in countless countries that the current vaccine does not prevent one from getting sick, transmitting the delta virus or from potentially being admitted to hospital / ICU. It only reduces the viral load and hopefully, people won‚Äôt end up extremely ill or die. 

The Government relies on modelling that overseas countries have proven to be wrong. Israel opened at 90% vaccination rates and yet has now gone into lockdown again with more than 6500 cases in 7 days and on average 19 deaths a day of mostly fully vaccinated people. The UK has more than 35% of those in ICU fully vaccinated. We know the vaccine will not prevent the virus. it does not stop the spread of the virus. This has been proven and we are in danger of the same fate as Israel if we fail to look at the whole picture. There is a medication that has been provisionally approved by the TGA called sotrovimab that seems to be having success overseas yet the NSW Government has failed to inform you of this. This is on Greg Hunt, Federal Minister of health page. 

We need to realise that the vaccine currently on offer was designed to combat a variant that no longer is the dominant virus. The Vaccine was not designed to combat the Delta variant. We need a holistic approach, which to some extent has happened but not in the way it needs to. Lockdowns need to be uniform and not discriminate based on where someone lives. The current outbreak did not originate in SW &amp; W Sydney it originated in Eastern Sydney. An area that even now is not mandated to get tested regardless of if they have symptoms or not. This is a failure of the NSW Government where it all started. Despite these areas being the cause of super spreader parties such as in Maroubra or a Positive case travelling to regional NSW coming from Rosebay and at the start of this mess someone from Bondi attending a party in SW Sydney, it denotes that there is some degree of noncompliance in every suburb. Not just in the ‚ÄúLGAs of concern‚Äù yet the Government refuse to acknowledge this. It is an insult to see photos of those in the beach suburbs sunning themselves on the beach and gathering for their coffee. While in SW &amp; W Sydney Helicopters patrol the air day and night. Looking for those ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù who dare to disobey. The ADF deployed to combat those people. (Again, against our own laws) Laws that have been changed by the Prime Minister to suit the narrative without proper and due course. The NSW Government is changing laws as well. The NSW Parliament is not sitting therefore any opposing MP‚Äôs cannot have their say on record in the parliamentary Hansard. The only way for MP‚Äôs to express their concern will never be on public record and so cannot be challenged later. 

Yet anyone speaking out against the narrative is attacked, vilified, abused, and labelled. Such is the narrative the NSW Government has created. Designed to divide. It feels like pre-WWII Germany. This creation of division is the start of convincing people that the unvaccinated are dirty and need to be squashed. Such is the fear that has been created that like Nazi Germany is designed to convince the people that there is only one way, their way and anyone who does not comply should be ostracized. This is the narrative that convinced Germans to turn against their Jewish neighbour and friends. This is what is happening in NSW. So many people have lost friends, neighbours who won't talk to them, families divided. This is a communist narrative. It is so devasting to see people turn against each other because of this. 

It feels as though SW &amp; W Sydney are being targeted not because of the ‚Äúalarming number of cases only‚Äù, but because most of this community are immigrants and have come from countries where this is the ‚ÄúNorm‚Äù and so are easily controlled and manipulated. 

The current ‚Äúoffer‚Äù of freedoms for the compliant screams abuse. Like an abductor, it offers what people want so that they become so submissive and compliant they will do whatever it takes to gain freedom. It has the makings of Stockholm syndrome. This is the very best of slavery idealisms. 

We live in a free democratic country, our rights to be free and make our own choices have been taken away illegally. We are entitled to our own opinion and our own thoughts our own choices. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are pro or hesitant or against it should be your right to choose. And it is your right to be able to freely express so without fear of retribution. As an Australian, you should not feel threatened or be made fearful of anything by the Government. 

We as a community can fight back regardless of your own convictions toward vaccination. It starts with respect. Respect that we can no longer expect from the NSW Government. 

The current abuse and labelling towards people is not the Australian way. Nor if you are a Christian, God‚Äôs way. Not the way in any religion for that matter.  

The Christian way or any religious way starts with love of fellow man. It involves loving your neighbour, &amp; kindness.  If you are Christian (or even if you are not) The bible command this from us and that is in any Christian faith.  The bible says ‚ÄúLove thy Neighbour‚Äù, ‚Äúlove others as I have loved you‚Äù. ‚Äúdo not judge, or you too will be judged‚Äù, ‚ÄúThree things will last forever‚Äîfaith, hope, and love‚Äîand the greatest of these is love.‚Äù These very statements form the basis of the ‚ÄúAussie way‚Äù regardless your faith or not.  

Be kind to each other, repair any bonds that you have broken, respect and love each other, stop the narrative, fill your newsfeeds and your groups with positive &amp; amazing things. Take out the narrative from FB.  Pray no matter what religion you are Christian, Muslim, Buddhist we need to stand united my fellow Australian brothers and sisters. Respect each other irrespective of medical choice, irrespective of who someone is, where they came from or their lifestyle choices. It is with love and kindness that we can change this.

Anyone can change the world; it starts with YOU!

"Top 77 Quotes From the 7 Harry Potter Books, Part 2 - From Prince to Hallows","Many inspirational quotes and real-world sentiments were expressed in this magical series, and below are my favorite ones *(note: the page numbers listed are from the Scholastic editions).* What are everyone else‚Äôs favorite *Harry Potter* book quotes?

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to be rude‚Äî‚Äú
‚Äú‚Äîyet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often...Best to say nothing at all...‚Äù (Vernon Dursley &amp; Albus Dumbledore, *Half-Blood Prince*, P. 46)

‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs one good thing...Snape‚Äôll be gone by the end of the year.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
‚ÄúThat job‚Äôs jinxed. No one‚Äôs lasted more than a year....Quirrell actually died doing it....Personally, I‚Äôm going to keep my fingers crossed for another death....‚Äù (Harry Potter &amp; Ron Weasley, *Half-Blood Prince*, P. 167)

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only Muggle-borns they hate, they‚Äôd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere is no way they‚Äôd let me be a Death Eater!...My whole family are blood traitors! That‚Äôs as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôd love to have me...We‚Äôd be best pals if they didn‚Äôt keep trying to do me in.‚Äù (Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, &amp; Harry Potter, *Half-Blood Prince*, P. 242)

He had known Ginny for years now....It was natural that he should feel protective...natural that he should want to look out for her...want to rip Dean limb from limb for kissing her...No...he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling.... (*Half-Blood Prince*, P. 289-290)

‚ÄúBut if I keep running in and out of the Ministry...won‚Äôt that seem as though I approve of what the Ministry‚Äôs up to?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell...well, yes, that‚Äôs partly why we‚Äôd like‚Äî‚Äú
‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôll work...You see, I don‚Äôt like some of the things the Ministry‚Äôs doing. Locking up Stan Shunpike, for instance.‚Äù
‚ÄúI would not expect you to understand...These are dangerous times, and certain measures need to be taken. You are sixteen years old‚Äî‚Äú
‚ÄúDumbledore‚Äôs a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn‚Äôt think Stan should be in Azkaban either...You‚Äôre making Stan a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.‚Äù
‚ÄúI see. You prefer‚Äîlike your hero, Dumbledore‚Äîto disassociate yourself from the Ministry?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be used.‚Äù (Harry Potter &amp; Rufus Scrimgeour, *Half-Blood Prince*, P. 346)

‚ÄúEr‚Äîwell‚Äîghosts are transparent‚Äî‚Äú
‚ÄúOh, very good...Yes, it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you, Potter. *‚ÄôGhosts are transparent.‚Äô*‚Äù (Harry Potter &amp; Severus Snape, *Half-Blood Prince*, P. 460)

‚ÄúI promised I wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone, and I‚Äôll take his secret to the‚Äî‚Äú
‚Äú‚Äînot the grave, surely?...The sewers, maybe...‚Äù (Moaning Myrtle &amp; Ron Weasley, *Half-Blood Prince*, P. 462)

‚ÄúHave you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back!‚Äù (Albus Dumbledore, *Half-Blood Prince*, P. 510)

‚ÄúYou are protected, in short, by your ability to love!...The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort‚Äôs! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart‚Äôs desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches.‚Äù (Albus Dumbledore, *Half-Blood Prince*, P. 511) 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre at my mercy....‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, Draco...It is my mercy, and not yours, that matters now.‚Äù (Draco Malfoy &amp; Albus Dumbledore, *Half-Blood Prince*, P. 592)

‚ÄúYou thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per‚Äôaps, you hoped?...What do I care how he looks? I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk!‚Äù (Fleur Delacour, *Half-Blood Prince*, P. 623)

...in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione. (Half-Blood Prince*, P. 652)

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt blast people out of my way just because they‚Äôre there...That‚Äôs Voldemort‚Äôs job.‚Äù (Harry Potter, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 71)

‚ÄúLook, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn‚Äôt damage your soul at all.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhich would be a real comfort to me, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù (Hermione Granger &amp; Ron Weasley, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 104)

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt hear stories like that when we were little, we heard ‚ÄòSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs‚Äô and ‚ÄòCinderella‚Äô‚Äî‚Äú
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that, an illness?‚Äù (Hermione Granger &amp; Ron Weasley, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 135)

‚ÄúDeclaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.‚Äù (Remus Lupin, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 208)

‚ÄúIf anyone shouldn‚Äôt go, it‚Äôs Harry, he‚Äôs got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head‚Äî‚Äú
‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll stay here...Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won‚Äôt you?‚Äù (Hermione Granger &amp; Harry Potter, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 231)

But they were not living, thought Harry: They were gone. The empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents‚Äô moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was sleeping under the snow with them. (*Deathly Hallows*, P. 328-329)

With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where ‚Äòchivalry‚Äô entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead. (Deathly Hallows*, P. 369)

‚ÄúAnd what would you say...to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be ‚ÄòWizards first‚Äô?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs one short step from ‚ÄòWizards first‚Äô to ‚ÄòPurebloods first,‚Äô and then to ‚ÄòDeath Eaters.‚Äô...We‚Äôre all human, aren‚Äôt we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.‚Äù (Lee Jordan &amp; Kingsley Shacklebolt, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 440)

‚Äú‚ÄòThe Boy Who Lived‚Äô remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.‚Äù - (Remus Lupin, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 441)

He had learned control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out...though Dumbledore, of course, would have said that it was love.... (*Deathly Hallows*, P. 478)

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to keep going until I succeed‚Äîor I die. Don‚Äôt think I don‚Äôt know how this might end. I‚Äôve known it for years.‚Äù (Harry Potter, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 568-569)

‚ÄúThe thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope.‚Äù (Neville Longbottom, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 574)

...even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny. (*Deathly Hallows*, P. 666)

‚ÄúAfter all this time?‚Äù
‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù (Albus Dumbledore &amp; Severus Snape, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 687)

Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and bounding heart? It would all be gone...or at least, he would be gone from it. (*Deathly Hallows*, P. 692)

He wanted to shout out to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home....But he *was* home. Hogwarts was the first and best home he had known. He and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here.... (*Deathly Hallows*, P. 697)

Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended, the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air.... (*Deathly Hallows*, P. 697-698)

It did not matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them: They were fetching him. (*Deathly Hallows*, P. 698)

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll stay with me?‚Äù
‚ÄúUntil the very end.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt be able to see you?‚Äù
‚ÄúWe are part of you...Invisible to anyone else.‚Äù (Harry Potter &amp; James Potter &amp; Sirius Black, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 700)

‚ÄúThat which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children‚Äôs tales, of love, loyalty, and innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. *Nothing.* That they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped.‚Äù (Albus Dumbledore, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 709-710)

‚ÄúIt is a curious thing...but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who...have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.‚Äù (Albus Dumbledore, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 718)

‚ÄúYou are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.‚Äù (Albus Dumbledore, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 720-721)

‚ÄúDo not pity the dead...Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love.‚Äù (Albus Dumbledore, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 722)

‚ÄúNeither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good....‚Äù (Harry Potter, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 737)

‚ÄúAccident, was it, when my mother died to save me?...Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? Accident, that I didn‚Äôt defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?‚Äù (Harry Potter, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 738)

‚ÄúYou mean he was weak!...Too weak to dare, too weak to take what might have been his, what will be mine!‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, he was cleverer than you...a better wizard, a better man.‚Äù (Voldemort &amp; Harry Potter, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 739)

‚ÄúMake sure you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother‚Äôs brains.‚Äù
‚ÄúRon, for heaven‚Äôs sake...Don‚Äôt try to turn them against each other before they‚Äôve even started school!‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right, sorry...Don‚Äôt get *too* friendly with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood.‚Äù (Ron Weasley &amp; Hermione Granger, *Deathly Hallows*, P. 756)",harrypotter,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/pd8no3/top_77_quotes_from_the_7_harry_potter_books_part/,,TKMLtheStar,pd8no3,/r/harrypotter/comments/pd8no3/top_77_quotes_from_the_7_harry_potter_books_part/,https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/pd8no3/top_77_quotes_from_the_7_harry_potter_books_part/,0,2021-08-28

My name is Stuart, i am 22yo (23 in 2mo), live in Germany, am 176cm tall/short, weigh... uh idk... im a bit chubby, but i am working on it! Green-Grey eyes and dark blond (lets call it brown) hair.

Personality:

I don't really like describing my personality... it always feels fake to me as you will have to trust me on this information just on word alone... But here i go:

* I would say i am an **emphatetic** person  
I try to place myself into the position of the person im talking to and i try not to judge people for for where they are in life or what they do
* I try my best to be **supportive**  
Of course i am just human too, so there are things even I can't or won't do or help with. But i try and try even harder for the person i love.
* I am **caring/considerate** of the person i love  
Its important to me how my partner feels and what they think about things. I want them to be able to open up to me, because they trust me and not because i am their partner.  
I want to get along with people, so i dont mind getting the short straw from time to time. I know my partner can't be there for me all the time, they have a life and friends too!
* I am **faithful**  
I mean sure... everyone will say they are... it is one of the few things that everyone needs to be otherwise relationships can't last. But it can't hurt to mention it anyways.
* I am **forgiving**  
Everyone makes mistakes and even in the best of relationships there are arguments. But i believe that in the end of the day there is no point in being mad about most things... especially not when it comes to your partner... as you love them. (And i want to cuddle anyway)
* Nonetheless i am **fortright/honest**  
About my feelings and thoughts about our relationship and lives. Communication is important for any relationship and my last one didnt have enough of it.

I also love to laugh about stupid/dark stuff and there are probably more things i could list or talk about... feel free to ask if there is something you look for personality wise that i didnt cover!

What i do with my life:

Many people want to know what their future partner is doing with their life. And that is understandable... After all you want to make sure that he/she is a functioning member of society... and that you dont have to feel bad for them in public.  
However... i personally dont hold these values... Sure... i want my partner to grow and succeed in life... but i think it is unreasonable to demand of them to have it all figured out (have a stable income, their own place to stay, etc.). Life can lead us so many different directions... and if you are between 18-28 then i think it is perfectly normal to just try and survive for now.

* I recently started an **apprenticeship as a medical assistant**  
It isnt the best paid job in the world by all means... but i love what i learn and love what i do there. Before i started this apprenticeship i was studying ""applied computer science"" at a University.. but it just wasnt for me.
* I watch **anime/series/movies** (fantasy/sci-fi/comedy/action/adventure/k-drama/etc.)  
I love to just lie back and relax. Especially ""after work"" days when im drained from having contact with so many people and learned so many new things. I love it even more when someone is there with me to appreciate the animations/stories/characters, or make fun of them.
* I play **video games** (FPS/Strategy/MMO/Sci-fi/Fantasy/Exploration/etc)  
But mainly with other people. I used to play a lot on my own... so much infact that it became a problem... but i got it under control now... even so far as that i would rather just relax instead of play.
* I listen to **music** (rock/pop/metal/classic/dubstep/acoustic/almost anything honestly)  
When im on my way to or from work and school and sometimes when i play games. I would love to just chill, talk and listen to music with (hopefully?) you sometime! Share music genres and songs... etc.
* I read **books** (fantasy/sci-fi/open to more)  
Not many... im not that much of a bookworm. But i do definitely read and i would be all the more happy to know you if you do too. \^\^

As you can tell... im not much of an outdoor person. But dont be fooled by it! I love nature. There is a lot of beauty to find out there. I just am comfortable at home. I do like taking walks and going out to eat... i just also love staying in and cuddle and eat while the rain hits the windows and leafs outside.  


If you are interested or have questions feel free to dm me!

Azur Lane: Blood and Iron chapter 9,"Here's the next chapter of Azur Lane: Blood and Iron

Fully story can be found here: [https://archiveofourown.org/works/31643129/chapters/83314579](https://archiveofourown.org/works/31643129/chapters/83314579)

&amp;#x200B;

Hamburg Navy Base.  
 

‚ÄúYou have what!‚Äù Stalingrad shouted as Admiral Hipper and Prince of  Wales walked into a conference room, still slightly shaken by being shouted at by Prinz Eugen.  
 

Inside the room were Stalingrad, Formidable, Unicorn, Enterprise, Akagi,  Dunkerque, Moltke, GCR Hipper, GCR Deutschland, Einhorn, and GCR Graf  Zeppelin. Stalingrad, Formidable, and Unicorn still had their rigging on, as there wasn't anywhere for them to put their ships at the moment.  Hopefully, they can sort that out before any problems start arising.  
 

‚ÄúLet me guess, someone just told you about the False-Kansen,‚Äù Prince of  Wales said as the two walked over to the table and sat down.  
 

‚ÄúYes they did,‚Äù Stalingrad said with a shocked look on her face before turning back towards the GCR Kansen ‚ÄúHow on earth did you people manage to make Kansen tanks, aircraft, and guns? All our tests resulted in a  massive explosion‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúThat, I'm afraid is classified information‚Äù GCR Deutschland replied,  ‚ÄúAnd considering their existence made the Sirens start making land units, I believe that it's for the best that your world doesn't make  False-Kansen‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúShe has a point,‚Äù Formidable said ‚ÄúWe're only just managing to keep the Sirens at bay. Adding land Sirens to the mix will only cause worldwide panic and make more Siren cults pop up. Those Siren worshippers have been growing in numbers as of late, so the last thing we need is to add more fuel to an already existing fire‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúI know. But I'm still confused as to how they were able to make them in the first place without everything blowing up‚Äù Stalingrad said ‚ÄúOh well, if it's safer for us to not know how you do it, then so be it. We can ill afford to fight the Sirens on land at the moment‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúAgreed. But before we get sidetracked again, let's get back onto the more important subjects, like where the hell the transport ship carrying the gate is, and how are we going to use it to get back? Because without Shinano, we can't find where our world is from this world‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúWell, we're kind of hoping that there is a Shinano in this world,‚Äù  Stalingrad said ‚ÄúWe couldn't bring  Shinano with us. She, along with her sisters, is too valuable to the Sakura Empire to send on a mission like this. So she couldn't come with us,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúSo yeah, kind of hoping that this world has a version of her‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúThat's understandable,‚Äù Akagi said ‚ÄúShinano is one of the three Decisives. The Sakura Empire can't afford to lose her, so if she dies or goes missing, it will strike a blow to us so hard that we will never recover from it. Still doesn't help us thou. Didn't our Shinano say if there was a version of her here?‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúNegative, she didn't‚Äù Stalingrad replied ‚ÄúShe didn't say anything about this world. We don't even know if Japan has Kansen‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúThis is the worst thought out plan I've ever heard of,‚Äù GCR Deutschland said ‚ÄúWe know nothing about the Japanese navy. We don't even know if they have Kansen or not. And even if they do, how the hell are we going to convince them to send their Shinano to help you. They've stopped their expansion efforts and are isolating themselves. We've had no word from them since‚Äù.  
 

Formidable sighed ‚ÄúWell, this plan has gone to hell. We're lost the transport ship carrying the gate, and we have no idea where our own world is in conjunction with this one,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúWe really should have pushed harder for them letting Shinano come along. We have no idea how we're getting back now‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúIs there any word on where the missing transport ship is?‚Äù Unicorn asked.  
 

GCR Hipper shook her head ‚ÄúI'm afraid not. We haven't found or heard anything about it since your arrival. It could be anywhere in the world and may take us years to find. I just hope it hasn't shown up in France or Russia, otherwise, we may never get it back‚Äù.  
 

Indeed that would be a disaster. They won't know what it is and will most likely dismantle it, breaking it apart so that they can find out what it does. If they do that then there is no chance of them ever getting home. And even if they did get it back, how were they supposed to find their world without Shinano? They were taking a real gamble that this world had a version of her, because if it didn't, then they would be stuck here even if they got the gate back.  
 

It was then that GCR Z23 walked into the room ‚ÄúSorry for the intrusion,  but we've just received a message from Vatican City. Apparently an  American Liberty ship has appeared outside of St. Peter's Basilica‚Äù she said, getting a lot of surprised looks from everyone in the room ‚ÄúThe  Italian army has moved in and have set up a perimeter around the ship,  but are holding back from entering the ship due to, and I'm quoting them here, a bunch of yellow egg-shaped birds that are preventing them from entering‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúYellow, egg-shaped birds,‚Äù GCR Deutschland said sounding confused before turning to the others ‚ÄúThose won't be those 'Manjuu' you guys have in your world?‚Äù she asked.  
 

‚ÄúYep, those are Manjuu alright‚Äù Formidable replied ‚ÄúWe brought them along to help put the gate together, as well as to control the transport ship we brought along. Which means the transport ship carrying the gate has landed in Vatican City. Oh, the pope is not going to be happy about that‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúJust prevent the Manjuu from leaving the ship and everything should be fine‚Äù Enterprise added.  
 

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù GCR Deutschland said nervously before turning back to GCR Z23  ‚ÄúZ23, please tell our Italian allies to keep an eye on the ship but not to board it. Its cargo is sensitive and will require specialists to safely remove its cargo. And tell them to capture any of those yellow birds that try to leave the ship‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúYes sir,‚Äù GCR Z23 said before she turned and walked out of the room.  
 

‚ÄúWell, at least we know where the ship is now,‚Äù Prince of Wales said  ‚ÄúNow all we need to do is find a way to get its cargo back here‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúWe could just go to Italy and build the gate there,‚Äù Akagi said ‚ÄúSaves us the hassle of moving it all back to Germany‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúYes, but getting there will be difficult‚Äù GCR Hipper said ‚ÄúThe Sirens have completely cut us off from Italy by land. They have control of everything between Nice and Geneva. And from Feldkirch all the way over  towards Monfalcone. We are completely cut off from them by land. Going around is no good as the sea is too dangerous right now as the  Mediterranean is swarming with Sirens‚Äù she explained ‚ÄúThe only way we can get through to Italy is if we are successful in recapturing everything between Mittenwald and Brenner. If we can recapture that passageway we can travel to Italy without having to worry about the  Sirens. Although it won't be easy as we're practically on the Siren's doorstep‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúSo, in other words, unless you lot can recapture all that territory from the Sirens, we can't get to Italy,‚Äù Dunkerque said.  
 

‚ÄúCorrect‚Äù GCR Hipper said ‚ÄúThe operation to recapture that area won't start for another week, and then we will have to wait for the area to be recaptured from the Sirens before we can even think of going to Italy.  So until then, you're all stuck here until we're told that the area is safe and given the go-ahead to move. And even then, it will still be a  dangerous trip. No doubt the Sirens will try and recapture it‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúWe all knew the risks when we agreed to come here, and that it might be a while before we can go home,‚Äù Formidable said ‚ÄúWe can wait as long as it is needed to get us home safely. This is something that we can not afford to rush‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúAgreed, rushing in like a bunch of idiots won't help any of you,‚Äù GCR  Hipper said ‚ÄúIn the meantime, I suggest that the new girls get acquainted with our world and the absolute shit situation we're gotten ourselves into‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúLanguage!‚Äù GCR Graf Zeppelin said, ‚ÄúThere are children present‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù GCR Hipper said ‚ÄúAs I was saying, you should get acquainted with our world. Your friends who arrived before you can do that, they already know the score here. If there are any other questions you have don't be afraid to ask us, we'll be willing to answer anything that you may have, as long as we are allowed to answer it. We are at war after all‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúOf courses,‚Äù Stalingrad said, ‚ÄúWe're also going to need a place to put our ships. The transport ship that was carrying the gate was also carrying fuel for us, without it we will quickly run out of fuel‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúThat ship is carrying fuel as well!‚Äù GCR Hipper said sounding shocked  ‚ÄúShit. Moltke, go catch up with Z23 and tell her to inform the Italians that the ship is also carrying a large amount of fuel onboard. The last thing we need is an oil spill in the middle of the Vatican‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúGot it,‚Äù Moltke said before she got up and rushed out of the room.  
 

‚ÄúWhy did you not mention that before?‚Äù GCR Deutschland asked.  
 

‚ÄúHonestly, I only just remembered it was carrying fuel‚Äù Stalingrad replied ‚ÄúStill need a place to put our ships, my serpents are getting a  bit restless. They don't like being out of combat for too long‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúI can see that,‚Äù GCR Graf said nervously, noticing the loud growls that  were coming from Stalingrad's rigging ‚ÄúMost of our fleet is out at the moment, so we should be able to provide you with some docking space for your ships. But we may need to move them from time to time when new ships come in. You may be our guests, but our ships and Kansen take priority here‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúThat is acceptable,‚Äù Formidable said.  
 

‚ÄúGood. Now let's bring you girls up to speed on what's happening‚Äù GCR  Hipper said before she went on to explain everything that had happened during the past few months, with Hipper pitching in when it came to what happened to them when they arrived.  
 

‚Äú- and then a French Char B1 heavy tank smashed through the building ahead of us and fired as us‚Äù Hipper explained ‚ÄúWe survived, but my sister Eugen lost both of her legs‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúShe what!‚Äù Formidable said sounding shocked, with a horrified look on both her, Unicorn, and Stalingrad's faces.  
 

‚ÄúIs she alright?‚Äù Unicorn asked sounding concerned.  
 

‚ÄúShe's fine, her legs are currently regrowing‚Äù Hipper replied ‚ÄúBut she's not exactly in a state to move at, the, moment. Oh bugger‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúOh bugger indeed,‚Äù GCR Hipper said with a sigh ‚ÄúI had almost forgotten that your sister isn't in a state to move, and won't be for several months. Getting her over to Italy will be difficult, even after we secure the passage there. The only thing we have that can transport her there is one of our hospital Zeppelins, and we can't requisition one as they don't full under the navy's command. Even if we could get our hands  on one, it wouldn't survive the trip even if we clear the area‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúIt'll be one big sitting duck to the Siren air force‚Äù GCR Graf added  ‚ÄúEven with adequate protection there is no guarantee that it will survive‚Äù.  
 

Hipper sighed, this was not good. They all had to go to Italy, but sea access was closed off, and the only land access was under Siren control.  Getting them and Eugen over there alive will be almost impossible, made even worse by Eugen's condition. Either they find a way to get her through safely, or she'll be left behind.  
 

‚ÄúEugen has to be told about this‚Äù Price of Wales said.  
 

‚ÄúI'll tell her,‚Äù Hipper said with a sigh ‚ÄúShe may not be in the mood to see me at the moment, but I think it's best that it's me who tells her this‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúNot in the mood?‚Äù Enterprise said sounding surprised ‚ÄúWhat did you do to her?‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúIt's family business. Doesn't concern you‚Äù Hipper replied before she stood up ‚ÄúIf I'm not needed here, I'll go tell her the news‚Äù.  
 

There was no objection, so Hipper left the room and made her way back towards the infirmary. She found her sister resting in her bed, still alone in the room.  
 

Prinz Eugen slowly turned to face her ‚ÄúDidn't I tell you not to come to see me again until you've managed to get along with Prince of Wales?‚Äù  she asked.  
 

‚ÄúSorry sis, but something important has popped up,‚Äù Hipper said as she walked over the Eugen and sat down on the bed next to hers ‚ÄúThe Azur  Lane hasn't been sitting idle during the past week we've been stuck here. They've sent a team here along with a transport ship carrying components to build a riftway gate here, allowing us to get back‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúOh thank god for that‚Äù Eugen said sounding relieved ‚ÄúThis world is nice and all, but I'll prefer to get home ASAP‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúYeah, about that‚Äù Hipper said.  
 

Eugen sighed ‚ÄúThey've made a complete pig arse out of it all, haven't they?‚Äù she asked.  
 

Hipper nodded ‚ÄúStalingrad, Formidable, and Unicorn arrived in this world off-target, way off target. They were supposed to show up in the Baltic sea, instead, they landed right on top of us. Well, Stalingrad and  Formidable did, Unicorn was picked up by her counterpart here‚Äù she explained ‚ÄúAs for the transport ship, it's all the way in Italy, right in the middle of the bloody Vatican City. Right outside St. Peter's  Basilica if you would believe it‚Äù.  
 

Eugen laughed ‚ÄúOh that's just golden. This has got to be the biggest  cock-up in the Azur Lane's history,‚Äù she said with a smile ‚ÄúI can't help but notice that Shinano's name wasn't among the list of people who came to rescue us‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúYeah, the Sakura Empire can't afford to lose her, so she wasn't sent,‚Äù  Hipper said ‚ÄúWe are now blindly hoping that there is a version of her in this world. But due to the GCR not knowing anything about Japan or its navy, we have no idea if she was even built in this world‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúWell that's just great,‚Äù Eugen said ‚ÄúThe rescue team is trapped here with us, the gate home is stuck in another country that is blocked by  Sirens, and the one person that we need to help us get home may or may not be here. Things aren't looking good for us‚Äù she said with a sigh  ‚ÄúAnd I take it that my condition complicates things‚Äù.  
 

Hipper nodded ‚ÄúThere's no way for us to safely transport you over to  Italy at the moment. Even if the GCR was to capture the passageway,  it'll still be dangerous to use as it is on the Sirens front door‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù Eugen said ‚ÄúWell, hopefully, they can think up something. Because the only alternative is to leave me behind‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúNo, that's not happening. We are not leaving you behind!‚Äù Hipper said.  
 

‚ÄúHuh. My older sister actually caring about me for once‚Äù Eugen said with a smile ‚ÄúThis world really changed you‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúOh shut up, Eugen!‚Äù Hipper said sounding annoyed ‚ÄúYou know none of us will leave you behind, Wales especially considering you're marrying her  when we get back! Crippled or not we are not leaving you behind‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúWell you're going to have to‚Äù Eugen snapped ‚ÄúLook at me, my legs are gone! I can't leave here and travel to Italy with you, not in my current condition. Face it, I'm a liability right now and will only slow you lot down. Or worse, get you all killed‚Äù.  
 

‚ÄúThen perhaps you haven't gone over all of the options available to you,‚Äù a voice said.  
 

The two sisters turned towards the door, where the voice came from, and both of them were shocked by who they saw standing in the doorway  ‚ÄúBl√ºcher!!?‚Äù.",AzureLane,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/pd89gl/azur_lane_blood_and_iron_chapter_9/,Fanfiction,META2012,pd89gl,/r/AzureLane/comments/pd89gl/azur_lane_blood_and_iron_chapter_9/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/pd89gl/azur_lane_blood_and_iron_chapter_9/,0,2021-08-28

In the Heart of Darkness-Chapter 1 (Part 1),"Chapter 1-In the Beginning


Introduction

This is my little introduction. i know it doesn't seem like much, but it's all that it is. Harvey Wickston is my characteristic pride and joy, created by a mix of several different sources. I always wanted to have a group of villains and heroes in two competing agencies of my creation. It looks like it happened. Darkstar Corporations, the villains side, is the best. I've always favoured the villains, and i wanted to have a really cool group of my own. It started with Lois Thomas. By the way, his name is pronounced Lewis. The villains bring Harvey into their group in 1994, readily accepting him as a part of their group and an ultimate villain

But what are his plans for Darkstar Corp? Is he going to betray them?

Then there's the heroes side. With Mayor Cannonball in the lead, the heroes will always win. Or will they? What's the real story with Cannonball and Harvey?

After Harvey steps in, the secrets start pouring out. Who is Twister in love with? What's up with Harvey and his brother? Why doesnt he want anyone to know about Trey? Is everything in place, or out of place

Once again, the story is at the control of the writer's fingertips a.k.a. me. The pieces come together in an unlikely fashion, with more secrets than you can shake a stick at.

                Harvey Wickston was a killer. A cold-blooded killer. Whenever he itched to kill, he would go out on the town and see who's mind signal seemed the most promising. His favorite pasttime was using his powers to scare the hell out of people.

                He was born in Almonte, and had been living there pretty much all his life. He loved the town.

                It was 3:00 in the morning, and he was playing Mario Kart. He didn't need his powers to play the game, and didn't use them. It was a skill that ran in his veins. Actually, Harvey didn't really use his powers for much except to scare people, and, sometimes to catch his victims.

                Harvey should have been asleep, except that he couldn't sleep. He was much too excited.

                The first thing he was excited about was his birthday. In 9 days, he was going to be 36 years old. Harvey loved birthdays, or just parties in general.

                The second thing he was excited about was a kill. There was a kid 2 doors down from him. The kid's name was Mick Henderson. Harvey had been scaring Mick for almost 9 weeks now. He did the usual stuff. He gave the kid nightmares and weird visions, made him hear voices, wrote things on the mirror in blood. He had scheduled the kill for tonight. He'd been locked onto the kid's mind signal all night. As soon as Mick got up, Harvey would make his move.

 

¬•¬•¬•

 

                Mick's house was big. Along one wall of it was the cabinet his parents had placed there for their son's accomplishments. There were things Mick was proud of. At age 12, Mick had beaten his dad at Monopoly. Mick was student council president last year. Mick was fifteen.

                He woke up at 3:30 in the morning. It was his parents' anniversary, so they had gone to a hotel Friday evening, and would be coming home on Sunday morning. Mick was left to take care of himself.

                He got up to get a Pepsi. It was his first night alone, and he was having fun.

                Until he heard a voice.

                ""Hello, Mick.""

                Mick spun around. There was a man standing up against the wall.

                ""Hi,"" said Mick. ""My parents are out of town, so if you're gonna rob the place, start with their room. That's where all the good stuff is.""

                Harvey stared at Mick with genuine interest. Then he said,""I'm not here to rob you.""

                ""Good, cuz I wouldn't of let you. I know karate. I'll probably just put you in a stranglehold or something. Okay. I'm going to my room to call the police now.""

                Mick played it cool, but his mind signal told Harvey he was scared shitless.

                Harvey followed the kid and tried to scare him some more.

                ""I put a karate instructor in a death grip when I was 8. I killed a teacher when I was 10. You don't even want to know how many people I've killed.""

                ""I probably don't,"" said Mick casually, even though Harvey could tell that his ploy was working. ""You sure killing all those people is something to be proud of?""

                He said it the way a 6-year old might invite one of his friends to the arcade after school.

                ""Yup, I'm sure,"" said Harvey.

                ""Okay...okay. Did you ever beat your dad at Monopoly?""

                ""No, but I beat him at Mario Kart a lot.""

                ""Well, have you mostly been killing people here in Almonte?""

                ""Mostly.""

                ""Well, now we know where all those missing residents went to. I'll make sure to tell the police to come get you.""

                Then he picked up the phone. But Harvey had already thought of that, and disabled the phonelines.

                ""No signal,"" said Mick. ""Damn.""

                Harvey chuckled. ""You're not telling the police anything. You didn't really think I'd let you turn me in, did you?""

                ""Who are you, anyways?"" asked Mick.

                ""My name is Harvey Wickston."" Harvey chuckled again. ""Do I detect a hint of fear?"" His voice turned dark. ""Maybe you're not as brave as you'd like to think you are. You're going to die tonight, Mick. I know you're scared, but don't worry. All my victims are scared of me. They should be,"" he said darkly.

                Mick had started crying now. Harvey had known he could make the kid show his true feelings if he kept going. Harvey knew how to make anyone sick to their stomachs. If they weren't scared of him...well, there were ways.

                Mick was really scared now, and Harvey was enjoying every minute of it. When his victims were full of fear, he was full of excitement.

                ""Leave me alone,"" Mick said, in a barely audible voice.

                ""Certainly,"" said Harvey darkly. ""Right after your heart stops beating."" Then he started laughing.

                Mick ran for the door, but Harvey was faster. He pulled Mick down to the ground with him. As they went down, Mick pulled a tablecloth off the table nearest to him. He hoped to break the vase on top of it and alert the neighbors. Once again, Harvey was too quick. He caught the vase right before it hit the ground.

                Then Harvey tied Mick's hands behind his back.

                Mick tried to yell for help, but Harvey used his powers to mute the cry.

                ""Save your breath,"" he said. ""You'll need it.""

                Mick tried to yell for help again, and once again, nothing came out.

                ""Shut up!"" growled Harvey. ""Everyone's trying to sleep.""

                ""Let me go!"" cried Mick.

                ""Shhhhh,"" said Harvey. ""Okay, it's okay.""

                Mick remembered last week, when he'd woken up screaming from a terrible nightmare, and his girlfriend had been there to comfort him. He remembered how much better he'd felt afterwards, but there was something about Harvey doing it that only made the situation scarier for Mick. Which was, of course, Harvey's intention.

                Mick started fighting for his life.

                ""Shhh. It's okay. Okay. Just relax.""

                Finally Mick stopped trying to fight and accepted whatever was coming. He just started crying. He tried not to show Harvey how scared he really was, even though he already knew.

                ""Okay,"" said Harvey. ""There we go. That's it. Shhhh. That's a good boy.""

                Harvey took him to the curb where his car was parked. He put Mick in the back of the car, then got in the front.

                He turned on the radio and started singing along to The Beatles.

                Mick looked around. The streets were deserted. There was nobody to call out to. He felt helpless.

                Harvey opened the window, still singing, ""When I'm 64.""

                Mick heard a dog bark, and thought he heard someone yell something in Russian. This was all a nightmare, thought Mick. It's all just a nightmare.

                ""That's what a lot of people think,"" said Harvey suddenly.

                ""Huh?"" said Mick, looking up, disturbed from his thoughts.

                Harvey didn't say anything for a minute. He was fiddling with something in his lap. Then he put a Bluetooth on his ear.

                ""A lot of people think it's just a nightmare,"" Harvey repeated. ""But they're wrong. It's how things work. You live. You die. Everybody dies eventually. Even I'm going to die. But not tonight. Tonight it's your turn.""

                ""When I'm 64"" ended, and ""Replay"" started.

                ""How did you know what I was thinking?"" asked Mick, as the tears continued to roll down his cheeks.

                ""I can read people's minds. It's a very useful skill. Let me tell you, you're not the first of my victims to think this is a nightmare. In fact, a lot of my victims think it's a nightmare. Until the pain starts, that is.""

                ""Pain?"" asked Mick, in a scared voice. ""What pain?""

                ""You'll see,"" said Harvey.

                ""Where are we going, anyway?"" asked Mick.

                ""Somewhere where nobody can hear you scream,"" said Harvey, then laughed.

                Mick started to panic again, but there was nothing he could do.

                So instead he said, ""Why me? I haven't done anything to you.""

                ""I know.""

                Mick didn't say anything else. He just watched helplessly as Harvey answered his Bluetooth.

                ""Hello,"" said Harvey. ""Oh, hey, Frank! You are? Oh, well, that's great! All right, I'll see you there. Okay, bye.""

                Then he hung up.

                ""Oh, perfect,"" said Harvey. ""Here we are.""

                They were at an abandoned place. Mick wasn't really sure what the place was, but it looked like it used to be a corner store.

                Harvey took Mick inside. Mick looked around. The store, or whatever it once was, was covered in cobwebs from floor to ceiling. Everything of value seemed to have been removed. The place looked to have been almost empty for quite some time now. All that was left was a chair, a broom, a cash register that looked like it was from old times, and a chocolate bar that was unopened. There was also a door that led to another part of the store, Mick thought. Or maybe it was a fire exit.

                Almost everything had been removed from the store long ago. Whatever was left was completely valueless. To normal people, anyway. But not to Harvey. He tied Mick to the chair.

                Then he put down his bag. He had a black bag that he had brought from the car. Mick had been too scared to ask what was in it, but now he started wondering again and his heart started pounding.

                Mick watched in horror as Harvey put some tools out on the floor. They looked like torture devices. Mick's heart was pounding like crazy, and then he started crying again. He was afraid of what his captor was going to do to him. Which was, of course, exactly what Harvey wanted. He could tell he was really going to enjoy this.

                ""What are you going to do to me?"" whispered Mick.

                ""Oh, don't worry,"" replied Harvey. ""I'm just going to have a little fun, is all.""

                Mick started struggling and fighting like crazy again.

                He screamed again, even though he knew it was hopeless. He started yelling at the top of his lungs. To his surprise, something actually came out. Mick screamed again.

                ""HELP!!"" he yelled. ""SOMEBODY HELP ME!!!""

                Harvey chuckled darkly.

                ""You can scream all you want out here,"" he said. ""Nobody can hear you.""

                Mick was crying. ""No,"" he whispered. ""No. Don't do this.""

                ""Shh. It's okay. There's nothing to be scared of. It's just pain. That's it. That's a good boy. Now close your eyes, Mick. Shhhh, shh, shh, shh. Good boy, Mick. Okay. That's it. Now just count backwards from three.""

                ""No,"" whispered Mick.

                ""No?"" Harvey was genuinely surprised. When Harvey had his victims tied up and they realized they couldn't get out of the situation, they usually just cooperated.

                ""Please. Don't do this. Just let me go. Please!""

                Harvey sighed. ""Fine."" He smiled, and Mick could see the darkness in his eyes. ""If you won't count, then I will.""

                Mick started crying and screaming.

                ""Shhhh,"" said Harvey. ""Just close your eyes. Shhhh. It's just pain.""

                Mick squeezed his eyes shut.

                ""Good boy. 3...2...1.""

                There was a lot of screaming after that. Mick was crying and screaming and Harvey was soothing him. Harvey was only soothing Mick because he knew it made the situation scarier for him.

                Several hours later, Harvey decided he'd had his fun with the kid, and it was time to kill him and go to bed. He reached back into his bag.

                ""Okay, Mick,"" he said. ""You're going to die now.""

                Mick shook his head.

                ""Shhhhh,"" said Harvey. ""Don't be scared. Just close your eyes, take a deep breath, and count backwards from 3. It'll be painful, but quick.""

                Mick already had his eyes closed, so he took a deep breath.

                ""Shhhhh. Relax. That's it. That's a good boy. This is going to hurt.""

                Mick counted backwards from 3.

 

¬•¬•¬•

 

                Nothing could have prepared Mick for what came next. The pain was excruciating. Mick screamed in agony as the spike was pressed into his head. Over his screaming, he could just hear Harvey chuckling to himself.

                The pain only lasted 30 to 60 seconds, but it was the most terrifying 30 to 60 seconds of Mick's life.

                And then, it was over. That was it. Mick was dead. Harvey tried the doorknob to the back room. It was unlocked. Harvey opened the door with ease and peeked inside. A bathroom. With a sink. Harvey turned on the water. Despite being deserted for such a long time, the place still had running water.

                Harvey rinsed his tools. Then he put them back in the bag. Harvey walked over and picked up the candy bar and the old cash register. Then he put his bag over one shoulder and put everything in the backseat of his car.

                Then he headed back inside. He had to do one more thing. He wrote a message on the wall in blood. ""IT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING.

                Harvey got in his car, drove home, and washed his hands. He opened the chocolate bar. It looked fine, so he ate it. He put the cash register in his bedroom on his dresser. Then he fell asleep paying bills.

 

*******

 

                When Harvey woke up, it was past noon. He opened the window in his bedroom. From there, he could see the Hendersons'. Just as he'd thought, even hoped, there were a bunch of cop cars. Police and other people were gathered around the house. In the middle of it all were Mr. and Mrs. Henderson.

                Harvey chuckled and congratulated himself. All his hard work had paid off.

                ""It's all about timing,"" he muttered to himself.

                Then he went upstairs, changed, and walked over to the Hendersons'.

                ""Hey,"" he said to one of the cops. ""What happened? What's going on?""

                ""Henderson kid's gone missing,"" the cop replied simply. Then he turned back to his work.

                ""Cooper!"" cried a familiar voice. Frank was standing beside Harvey.

                Harvey was only Harvey Wickston to his victems. To everybody else, he was Cooper Branson. Nobody met Harvey Wickston and lived. Everybody knew Cooper, though. It was a small town. Everybody knew everybody, and everybody knew Cooper Branson. Frank and Tom were Cooper's best friends. Cooper was only Harvey's cover. If you met Harvey Wickston, you died.

                ""Geez, Frank,"" said Harvey. ""You don't have to deafen me.""

                ""Sorry, Coop.""

                There was maybe two seconds of silence.

                Then Frank said,""Coop, you hear about what happened here last night?""

                ""No. I have no idea what's going on.""

                ""The Hendersons' kid went missing. Nobody knows where he went. Did you see or hear anything suspicious last night?""

                ""No, nothing. Wait. Mick Henderson?""

                ""That's him. What would anybody want with that kid, anyway? He never did anything to anybody. Although, I could maybe understand if somebody wanted to hold him for ransom. His parents are supposed to be rich.""

                ""Frank, if the Hendersons were rich, they wouldn't be living in a place like this.""

                ""Well, that's just the perfect cover, now, isn't it?""

                ""Can you explain to me what exactly happened?""

                ""Well, it was Mick's parents' anniversary, so they went away for a couple of nights to stay in a hotel. They left the kid to take care of himself. Right before they went to bed, they called him and he answered. Then, when they woke up the next morning, around 8:00, they called him again. He didn't answer, and his parents just assumed he hadn't woken up yet. After about half an hour, they called again. They started to get worried, because he's always up by 8:15. No exceptions. They hung up and tried again, and got a no service ring. They called the cops, then drove home really fast. They made it back in an hour, and found this. Lights off. Phones dead. Kid missing.""

                ""I better go look around,"" said Harvey.

                He walked all around the house full circle.

                ""It doesn't look like anyone broke into the house,"" he said.

                ""The kid didn't scream or cry, because somebody would've heard him.""

                ""I know I would've.""

                ""You know what this means? This town isn't safe for decent people like us anymore.""

                ""Oh, I'm sure we'll be fine. This'll all blow over pretty soon.""

                ""I don't think so. Hundreds of people are dying every year. And not of natural causes, either. It looks like they were tortured to death or something. This is really messed up. There's already been 20 deaths this month. I gotta get outta here.""

                ""C'mon, Frank. Take a chill pill. They'll catch this guy.""

                But in his mind, he was thinking, No, they won't.

¬•¬•¬•

                It was almost 1:00. Harvey wondered if he should even bother opening up the convenience store. The store was just part of his cover, of course, but he liked it. He was an entrepreneur, and it was just a single store. It wasn't a chain. He decided to open the store. That way he could make some money, and maybe he'd hear some more gossip about Mick's disappearance.

                He was right. About 20 minutes after he opened the store, two women came in. He couldn't really tell what they were talking about until they came up to the counter to pay.

                ""Good morning, ladies,"" he said.

                ""Well, good for some people. Not so good for others,"" said the woman on the right.

                ""What's that supposed to mean?"" asked Harvey curiously. ""Wait, you're not talking about what happened to Mick Henderson, are you?""

                The woman nodded, but her friend said,""Why? What happened, Samantha?""

                ""Don't tell me you haven't heard!"" said Samantha. ""Mick Henderson's gone missing! Didn't you see all the cop cars that were in front of his house?""

                ""Were there any clues to his disappearance?"" asked the other woman.

                ""None that they found.""

                Then another girl stuck her head in the door, and said, ""Ashley, Samantha, hurry up! We're gonna miss the movie.""

                ""Okay, Melanie, we're coming!"" called Ashley.

                ""Well, see you later,"" said Samantha.

                Harvey read their mind signals as they walked out of the store.

                All three of the girls were thinking that he looked familiar.

                ""No wonder,"" muttered Harvey to himself. He had been thinking the same thing. They were friends of Jenny Woods. It had been 4 years since he'd killed her, but he remembered it like it was yesterday. Watching her pointlessly trying to save her own life. Watching her cry. Hearing her scream. It had been fantastic. But that was a long time ago. He thought about Mick last night. Heard the screaming and the crying again. He smiled to himself as he replayed it in his head. He knew it was something he wouldn't forget with time. Harvey remembered everyone he killed.

                In fact, he was so lost in his daydream that he didn't even hear the bell as his girlfriend entered the store.

                ""Hi,"" she said.

                Harvey was startled out of his memories. He opened his eyes. Lauren was at the counter, her elbows propped up against it, her chin resting on her hands.

                ""Hi,"" he said, smiling at her.

                She smiled back. ""What were you thinking about?""

                ""Oh, nothing much. Just something I did last night.""

                ""And you had fun,"" guessed Lauren. ""I saw you smiling.""

                ""I had lots of fun.""

                ""Did you hear what happened last night? With-""

                ""Mick Henderson. How could I not have? The whole town's been talking about it.""

                ""I got asked about Mick about 10 different times just on my way here.""

                ""I'm sure they'll find out who's doing this.""

                ""Slow day?"" Lauren changed the subject.

                ""It's Saturday. It's the middle of the day. More people will show up.""

                ""Well, you look kind of bored for now. Do you wanna close up and come get some lunch with me?""

                ""Now?""

                Lauren giggled.

                ""Sure. I got nothing better to do.""

I fucked my work (F) colleague after over a year build up (M) PT 3,"The final part of the saga its long but has details, 

A few months after the incident at her boyfriends house the girls i worked with and I decided to head into town for a night out, we hit the party district in the city i live in, it was myself, Bridgett, Bridgett's boyfriend and about 6 of the other work girls. I started the night at Bridgetts boyfriends house pre drinking we then went into town and started to party. Joanna one of the other girls i worked with started dancing with me Joanna had just turned 18 was blonde hair blue eyed with a great body, Bridgett and I had often talked about wanting to fuck her and what we would do to her given the chance, I saw my opportunity made eye contact with bridgett and motioned towards Joanna who at this time was grinding up and down my leg as I grabbed her ass, Bridgett smiled slyly and made her way over, I grabbed Bridgett and pushed her into Joanna and as they started dancing I grabbed the back of their heads and pushed them together and they started making out. Shortly after we decided to leave the club Bridgett being my wing woman asked Joanna if she wanted to come back to her boyfriends and keep drinking she jumped in the cab with us and shared it back to Bridgetts boyfriends house. We got to the driveway and all climbed out me the BF, Bridgett and Joanna you coming i asked Joanna hoping she'd say yes, ""you'll have to share a bed with him said bridgett motioning towards me"", i turned to Joanna and said you can share a bed with me but i'm not going to be a gentleman i'll definitely try to fuck you i said with a smirk Joanna looked at me said she'd love to come in but had a boyfriend and should go home hesitantly jumping back in the cab.

That left Bridgett her boyfriend and I we made our way into the house as we walked in her boyfriends mother was on the couch sleeping, Bridgett took me to the spare room, this is where you are sleeping she said I thanked her shut the door stripped off to my underwear and lay on the bed with the light on. looking at my phone thinking about my missed opportunity with Joanna. I heard some talking outside my door than the door swung open and Bridgetts boyfriend stuck his head into the room he then disappeared a second latter Bridget was pushed into the room and the door closed behind her.

Bridget was wearing a long white t-shirt with boy leg panties she crawled over two me and smiled her blue eyes not breaking eye contact she than started to rub her face on my cock under my Calvins, she started to pull my cock out of my underwear she dropped a condom on the bed next to me, i picked it up looked at her than threw it across the room I had all ready decided i was going to fuck her raw (why would i have a shower with a raincoat on) she smirked at me and than smiled coyly when she saw what i did with the condom, she than started to greedily suck my cock, she was bent over from the side of the bed i pulled her head up and started kissing her before pushing her head back onto my cock, I slid my hand down her back pulling down her panties and started to rub my finger around her ass then down to her clit i could all ready feel how wet she was i slid two fingers inside her pussy working them back and forward getting them covered in her juice than slid up to her ass and pushed my two fingers inside lubricated by her pussy, she moaned as i started to work my fingers in her ass moving between sucking my cock and licking and sucking on my gooch and balls.

How to tell my mom (37F) to leave her emotionally abusive husband (52M) and help her see her worth?,"Sorry for the long post, I just really want to be a let I help my mother.

So basically my mom is my entire world. She may not be the best mom there is, but I hate to see her suffer in silence. About 5 years ago she married my second stepdad, i‚Äôll call him J.

They were head over heels and I thought he was perfect for her. Her last husband was sexually abusive towards me and ruined her self esteem, credit, savings, and ended up going to prison. My actual dad was who she considered her soulmate, but he was killed so I felt like J was as close as she could get to one.

In the recent year, my mom found out she had PCOS after having unexplainable rashes and scarring that covered her whole face and appeared on her arms. She spends a lot of time in the bathroom hiding because she‚Äôs self conscious. J did not understand this and is very unsympathetic towards people with self esteem or mental health issues.

J has always tried to involve my younger brothers and I, an adult, in their arguments and will try to say things that aren‚Äôt true to pit us against her. It wasn‚Äôt until recently I realized what he was doing. A few months back I was over at their house doing laundry, when I went to load the laundry in my car, J came up and started telling me my mom was on meth, saying that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs always in the bathroom and it‚Äôs the reason for all of the marks/scabbing on her face and arms. He even started crying about it.

I was appalled as anyone would be, and I started crying as well, not wanting it to be true. He told me that because she recently started taking my youngest brother to drop him off with his dad, her druggie and abusive ex, that she was getting meth from him. J also said that he told my grandmother, her mom, about it already. I cried and cried and we hugged, and I went home to process this.

Come to find out, my grandmother never talked with him and was astounded that he would accuse her of that, and said there isn‚Äôt any way that‚Äôs true, especially since he lied about having a talk with her. I started to be confused, and thought maybe he was mistaken.

For the last few months, i‚Äôve started to see how manipulative he is being, telling my younger, impressionable brothers things about my mom and me as well. 

I am currently 2 weeks away from being 6 months pregnant and my mom has been excited, more than I knew anyone could ever be. She makes good money and used her income tax to buy me baby stuff. J gets mad any time she spends money and became especially mad when she bought all of this baby stuff. It‚Äôs worth noting he will give money away to his sons like it‚Äôs nothing, it‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt have the money it‚Äôs just that he hides it from her and then when she tells him what she spends of her own he gets mad.

Today I went over to see my mother and spend time with her after not seeing her for 3-4 weeks. We were having a good time but J came home and I went to hug and talk with him. When I hugged him he made a comment about my boobs being pressed against him and I immediately pulled away, and I don‚Äôt even remember what he said because I was so shocked that it sent me into panic because of my previous trauma. There were times before since I was about 16 he would playfully slap me on the butt but I assumed it was just a normal thing, even if it made me uneasy. I instantly knew he was drunk after this incident and I excused myself and went to check on some of my laundry I was doing. 

J left to go take my brother to meet up with his dad, and I went to spend more time with my mom, trying to shake off the incident. Fast forward, he‚Äôs back home, sitting in the kitchen. My mom wanted to see if she could feel my baby kicking, but has 2 pet squirrels that roam around her room freely sometimes, so she said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go to the kitchen so we‚Äôre not bothered by them‚Äù. When we got to the kitchen, my mom was trying to feel on my belly but J said something about not having dinner, and my mom said she had cook.

He complained and then when she walked over to the stove to show him, he said, ‚ÄúWow, she looks like a fucking train wreck‚Äù, followed by a super nasty comment about her appearance that I can‚Äôt even remember. She teared up and went to her room immediately. I told him he was being extremely rude and hurt her feelings, and he denied it.

I went after her and we started talking. She opened up about so many things I didn‚Äôt know. How he has commented on her facial scarring in the past, her weight, which she isn‚Äôt very heavy at all, her job, her staying in the bathroom and being self conscious. He also has always been extremely mean and made comments to my younger brothers before about their appearance or personality, but she said last week J wrote a note to my youngest, 12 year old brother saying that ‚ÄúI, J, no longer will help you with your education and do not care if you fail or pass‚Äù. He has left the note in my brother‚Äôs room and it totally hurt his feelings. I also mentioned his comment about my boobs and how he tried to tell all of us she was abusing drugs.

She then started having a panic attack and I hugged her, she told me about how she‚Äôs held all of this in because she wants to be supportive and focused on my brothers and I more than herself, especially me because of my previous mental health issues and pregnancy going on. 

I felt terrible not noticing how awful he was treating my mom. She is so sweet and lovely, it breaks my heart to see her self esteem wrecked like this. She is extremely intelligent and has so many opportunities, not to mention she‚Äôs so beautiful. Despite her hardships she has always taken care of us and gotten us away from terrible situations.

I hate wanting to tell her she should leave him because I know having another failed marriage would be hard on her, but I personally think she‚Äôs way worth more than any of this. Not to mention, after what he said to me, I feel very unsafe around him and don‚Äôt want to be near him, and my husband agrees.

She‚Äôs coming to stay with me this weekend, but I want to tell her she should get an apartment near me and that I will babysit and take or pick my brothers up from school if she needs. I already told her she‚Äôs always welcome in my home. I know it‚Äôs not easy to leave a marriage, especially seeing how much effort and caring she has put in, but her mental health is important and I don‚Äôt trust him to not make it worse. 

I really cared for him until all of this stuff slowly started coming up, I‚Äôve always had an uneasiness about him and have never been 100% comfortable around him, and my brothers have never grown to him because of how mean he is to them, but I guess I should have seen it coming after all the times as a teenager he would mock me for my depression and call me lazy even though I worked after school every day and would rest on my off days. He also always joked when I was younger that if I ever had a baby i‚Äôd probably just pawn it off on other people, which hurt me and stuck with me my entire pregnancy so far. 

I see now that he is such a prick and uses people‚Äôs emotions to make them feel bad. How can I help my mom see her worth?",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pd6fwv/how_to_tell_my_mom_37f_to_leave_her_emotionally/,,pgellie,pd6fwv,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pd6fwv/how_to_tell_my_mom_37f_to_leave_her_emotionally/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pd6fwv/how_to_tell_my_mom_37f_to_leave_her_emotionally/,0,2021-08-28
In the Heart of Darkness-Chapter 1 (Part 2),"
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They went to a Chinese food restaurant. They had been there a million times before, yet it never got old.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They ordered fried rice and wings and spareribs. Then they sat and talked.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""So, what do you think happened to Mick?"" asked Lauren.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Harvey shrugged. ""Dunno. Kidnapped. Ran away from home. Maybe even...dead.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I'm scared, Cooper,"" said Lauren quietly.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Harvey didn't say anything, mostly because he didn't know what to say. How do you tell a girl that you get your kicks from killing people, and that you don't really love her, because you're just using her to cover up your terrible crimes?
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Finally, he said,"" Don't be. I'll protect you.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There. That sounded right. It sounded like something Cooper would say, instead of Harvey.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Like most things in Harvey's-well, Cooper's life-Lauren was a nice change from his evil villain persona, Harvey found.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I dunno. Maybe I should just go.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Well, not yet! We still have to eat.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""No, you misunderstood. Cooper, I'm not talking about leaving the restaurant. I'm talking about leaving Almonte.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Leave town? Now?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""As soon as possible. The sooner the better.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Why?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Think about it.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† There was a long minute of silence.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Then Lauren said,"" What if he comes after me? Cooper, what if I'm next? I'm scared, Cooper. I have to get out of town. I'm sorry.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Then Harvey tried to change the subject.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As if on cue, Last Christmas started playing.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Would you care to dance?"" asked Harvey.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Okay,"" said Lauren.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Last Christmas was their song. It was the song that was playing the first time they'd ever kissed. They got up and danced together.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I had a really nice time,"" said Lauren, as they were on their way home.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""But it's not done,"" said Harvey. ""I was thinking you could come over and we could have a horror movie marathon.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It had been raining on and off all day, and now it was a full-fledged storm. Perfect horror movie weather.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† That was one thing Harvey liked about Lauren. She was a horror movie fanatic.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Yeah,"" said Lauren. ""Sure, I'd like that.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They walked to Harvey's house together. They made popcorn and had chocolate. Harvey always had candy with horror movies. Harvey decided to start them off with his favorite horror movie, Hostel.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Have you ever seen Hostel before?"" he asked Lauren.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""No, never.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Well, then, you're in for a real treat. Hostel is my favorite horror movie.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""If you like it, I'm willing to give it a shot.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""There is some gore, so if you're squeamish about that kind of thing, you should let me know now.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Oh, no, that's okay. Gore doesn't really bother me.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Okay, then.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They watched horror movies until 8:30 at night. The storm kept going, so they kept watching movies. They got through about four movies. Then Lauren decided it was time for her to go home. Harvey wanted her to stay a little longer, but he couldn't think of anything else for that night. Besides, they had a date tomorrow night.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† After Lauren left, Harvey just sat and played Mario Kart. He had another kill to take care of tonight.
¬†
*******
¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 16 year old Claire Thompson lived in the heart of Ottawa with her parents. It was 11:00 on Saturday night, and her parents had gone out for dinner and a late movie, leaving Claire to take care of herself.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Claire was still up watching Hostel. It was a little gory, but she liked the plot.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Suddenly she heard a noise, so she paused the movie.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† She listened, but she didn't hear anything, so she just sat and watched the movie again.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Then she heard another noise. She paused the movie again.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Hello?"" she called. ""Is anyone there?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Oh, hey, there you are."" The light came on.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Claire jumped at the voice, even though she recognized it.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Jesus, Rick!"" she cried, then lowered her voice. ""What the hell!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you."" Rick had a huge grin on his face.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""How did you get in here, anyways?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""The window."" Rick pointed. ""Don't worry. I locked it behind me.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Well, next time, use the front door.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""It's so much more romantic if I come in through the window.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Well, don't ever do it again.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Why? What's wrong?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Maybe the fact that you could get arrested for doing that.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I'm not gonna get arrested. Besides, there comes a point in every boy's life when he decides it's time to climb in his girlfriend's window.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""That's not funny, Rick,"" said Claire, but she was smiling.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I wasn't trying to be funny. I was trying to be romantic.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I thought you were an intruder.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Can't I climb in my girlfriend's window?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Claire smiled.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Maybe you've been watching too many scary movies,"" suggested Rick.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""You can never watch too many scary movies.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Anything you say.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Well, you may as well stay, now that you're here. Come on. You can finish watching Hostel with me.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Too many scary movies,"" muttered Rick, as he joined his girlfriend on the couch.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They watched the movie together, Rick with one arm around Claire the whole time. Then they were bored.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Claire had to go the bathroom. When she was coming out, it was dark. She quietly called out Rick's name. Then Rick jumped out from behind the corner and said, ""Boo!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Whoa!"" cried Claire, then started laughing.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Rick!"" she laughed. ""Don't do that!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Gotcha!"" said Rick gleefully.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Then they went back over to the couch.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""You wanna watch Hostel again?"" asked Claire.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Yeah, sure. It was a great movie.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They popped the disc back in. They had watched it about halfway through when Rick said that he had to go to the bathroom. He went to the bathroom. Claire was still watching the movie when he snuck up on her, grabbed her by the shoulders, and said,""Hi.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Claire jumped two feet in the air.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Oh, jeez, Rick!"" she cried.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I told you!"" insisted Rick. ""Too many scary movies.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""That wasn't funny, Rick. You scared the hell out of me!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Why? Are you afraid somebody's gonna sneak into the house and...chop your head off!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As Rick said that, he grabbed the remote and put it against Claire's neck. He did it gently of course, and playfully, but it still made Claire jump.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Cut it out, Rick,"" insisted Claire. She threw a pillow at him. ""Come on, that's not funny.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Hey,"" said Rick. ""Sorry. Look, I'm sorry, okay?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Okay. It's just, there's a killer on the loose in Almonte, and I'm a little on edge.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I heard about that. Hey, Claire. I love you, okay? And I don't ever wanna lose you.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Well, then, I guess you'd better come with me.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Why? Where are you going?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I have to call my parents and let them know I'm doing okay.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rick followed her to the phone.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It rang three times, then her mother picked up.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Hi, Mom,"" said Claire. ""Yes, I'm fine. Rick came in through the window. Apparently it was unlocked. Just watching movies. Okay. Okay. One second. Hey, Rick, my mom wants to talk to you! Hang on. He's hiding from me again. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go find Rick. I'll call you back before I go to bed. I love you, too. Okay, bye.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† She hung up and started looking for Rick.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Rick!"" she called. ""Rick!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Then there was a flash of lightning, and Claire thought she saw a man standing by the window. Another flash of lightning, and he was gone. Claire raced down the hall, yelling her boyfriend's name.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rick came around the corner. ""What?"" he asked. ""Claire, what's wrong?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""There's somebody in the house!"" said Claire through her tears.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† She went with Rick as he took a look around. He turned on all the lights, and there was nobody there.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""It's okay, Claire. There's nobody here. It was probably just your imagination.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Maybe I have been watching too many scary movies.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Don't worry. You're safe with me.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rick turned on Addicted by Simple Plan.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† He started singing along to it.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Come on, Claire!"" he insisted.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Claire giggled. They sang and danced a little bit. Then the phone rang.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rick turned the music down.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Hello?"" said Claire.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Hello, Claire,"" said the man on the other end.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Who is this?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Listen carefully, Claire. You're going to die tonight. Don't try and fight it. You'll only make things worse for yourself.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Then there was a beep. Claire had been disconnected.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† She ran to her boyfriend.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Hey, Claire!"" said Rick, but she ran right into his arms. ""What's wrong, baby? Who was that on the phone?""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""He said I'm going to die tonight!"" sobbed Claire. ""I'm scared, Rick! I don't wanna die!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Don't worry. You're not going to. It's okay. Claire, look at me. It's okay. You're safe with me. I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Claire nodded.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Suddenly, from down the hall, they heard ""Get Ready To Die"" playing.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Hey, Andrew W.K.! Awesome!"" said Rick. Then his expression changed. ""Wait a minute,"" he said. ""This isn't the music I put on.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""We should get out of the house,"" said Claire. She took Rick's hand, and they made a dash for the door.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† But there was someone there.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Harvey grabbed at them, but they spun around just in time and ran the other way.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Claire hurried to the phone and tried to call her parents. Unfortunately for her, the phonelines were down, and it wasn't because of the storm.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Then she looked back, and Rick was gone.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† She started looking for him, and ended up running into Harvey.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† He grabbed her, but Rick snuck up on him, and was about to hit him over the head with a baseball bat when he turned around and jumped on Rick.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Go!"" yelled Rick.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Harvey grabbed for her, but he was too late. Claire seized the oppurtunity to make a run for it. She hurried into her bedroom, slammed the door shut, and locked it.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Harvey used his powers, and the door swung open with a bang. Harvey jumped on Claire and pinned her down. Then he tied the two of them up back to back. Claire was crying, and Rick was breathing hard and trying to keep calm.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Someone from next door yelled,""Keep it down, Thompson, or I'm gonna call the cops!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Harvey froze. He waited at least ten minutes, until he was sure the guy had gone back to sleep. Claire tried to yell for help several times, but nothing came out.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Harvey took them to the car and put them in the backseat. He stopped at the gas station to get himself a little snack.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I'm scared, Rick,"" said Claire. ""I don't wanna die!""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Shh, don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay. We'll get through this. Don't be scared. I'm right here, okay? Listen, Claire, this guy's a madman, so whatever happens, no matter how much it hurts, you have to try not to scream, okay?"" They were holding hands, and Claire squeezed Rick's hand, but she nodded and whispered, ""Okay.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""He gets his pleasure from stuff like this,"" Rick continued. ""Don't worry. I'm right here. We'll get through this together.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Then Harvey came back to the car. He got in and turned on the radio. Last Christmas started playing.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Ooh, me and Lauren's song,"" he said. ""That's funny.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† He sang along to the song as he drove along. Then ""You Belong With Me"" started playing.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Soon they came to an abandoned bowling alley. Harvey got Claire and Rick out of the car and took them inside.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† He tied them to two seperate chairs and put them a few feet away from each other.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Then he chuckled darkly and said,""Okay, so here's what's gonna happen. First you're gonna watch your girlfriend die. Then you're gonna die.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Then Harvey thought he heard somebody say,""Kill the boy first.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† He looked behind him, but there was nobody there. He turned back to his victems.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Okay, change of plans. The boy dies first.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Claire started crying. ""Kill me first,"" she said through her tears.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Claire,"" said Rick. ""It's okay.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""No. Please. I can't watch him die.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Which is why I chose him,"" said Harvey simply.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Rick, you don't have to be a hero,"" Claire whispered.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Yes, I do,"" replied Rick, in a firm tone. He took a deep breath. ""Go ahead. Do your worst.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""By the way,"" said Harvey, as he unpacked his bag. ""I heard you two talking in the car. Or rather, read your minds. I will make you scream. Both of you. I know how. I have my ways. Okay, kid, here's the deal. You can say one last thing to your girlfriend over there before you die screaming.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""I love you, Claire. Not even death can tear us apart. And remember, don't scream, no matter what happens.""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Claire nodded.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Harvey muttered something to himself. Then he sighed happily.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Now the fun can begin,"" he said darkly, and moved in for the kill.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Close your eyes,"" he told Rick.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Rick was still trying to get control of himself, but he swallowed and closed his eyes. Harvey was sure he saw a tear roll down the kid's cheek. He smiled. Perfect. Rick was scared.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ""Now count backwards from three,"" Harvey told Rick.

opening up more about myself,"countries i have been  
\- since childhood se we have been going out so and later i have travelled  alone with friends for studies,etc. - i have been to countries like dubai, germany, france, italy, spain, usa, south africa, mexico, seychelles,  mauritius, morocco, uk, uganda, australia, nz, turkey, canada, greece, switzerland,  
do i drink /smoke  
\- yes , with friends/husband/ going out - 7/8 times a month, not fixed but depends upon occasions  
\- yes i smoke also but my husband doesn't knows. he only knows about hookah  
\- earlier i was not drinking/smoking/hookah - but this all are because of the men i was with  
why do i things that i find humiliating  
\- i like to please my dom and that is the reason i engage myself in doing things just to please him even if am not enjoying it  
\- being shared/rimming/being pimped or many things things like dressing as per his choice, not always i like to do that but if i am doing things then its only for the pleasure of the dom i am pleasing  
\- to make him happy and that look of satisfaction on his face and his praises and words that how well i please him - makes me do it  
do i have a master now  
\- i have got 2 online doms now and they are not online all the time  
\- what i am looking for is a dom or 3/4 doms who can use me as his cumdump whore and we can have a group  
\- where we can chat/ rp and do different kind os roleplays and all the while you guys are using me as your slut and i am pleasing you as my doms  
more about me  
\- after 18 when i was away from my hometown in the city, i lost my virginity and started enjoying sex  
\- the new college and the attention if got from the boys was something that i couldnt miss and that made me started experimenting with my hair/make up and clothes  
\- i realized the stares and comments passed and glances with i got were more if i wore tight clothes or revealing ones  
\- i enjoyed to teasing by doing things like bending to pick up things while i purposely left to fall down and then bending forward to pick them up or sometimes to get down as if i am picking something or adjusting my heels giving a show of my cleavage  
\- i always enjoyed these things and my looks and dance performances were always a add on factor with being popular in class/college  
\- i was maintaining my scores as always but there was something else going on and that was sexual relationship, but before that me share something more about me  
\- right from school time i was good in studies and the circle i had was from the similar background and class, and the looks and the group i was with made most of guys think i was out of their league and that was true  
\- then in college i was always approached by guys who had the courage to do so, be it telling me directly or indirectly or following me everywhere or through my friends, sometimes they used letters to express  
\- the men who are like puppy dogs , wanting to follow me everywhere or those who think i am out of their reach - none were the those that were my doms  
\- it started with me getting in relationships - having a boyfriend and then sometimes one night stands / flings and what i started realizing was that i like men who are confident and are like dominant, who make me feel like submissive  
\- it was when on of them called me bitch which did something to me and that then led to being name caliing  
myths and assumptions  
\- after joining reditt i realized there are a lot myths that guys have and i think this needs to corrected  
\- you see for the public i have head turner looks and my dancing skills and the way i carry myself and the background makes me unapproachable for most but i am just like any other normal girl who likes to go out with friends and watch movies  
\- the only difference is that about the submissive side or the sexuality thing, and that after reading about me you must be thinking that i am an easy girl who will sleep with anybody - NO, that is not the case..  
\- all the relationships i had , were carefully chosen and yes there were times when i met a guy at a part of event and we ended up fucking or having a so called one night stand but that is just one part of me, i wont do that with anyone or everyone  
\- i had boyfriends and then dom masters and when i say that i mean that many of the doms turned bfs and some bfs turned dom, and let me tell more about it  
relationships  
\- so it was about dating a guy, and getting to know me and sometimes sex was a part of our relationship right from the start or happened later or sometimes didnt happened and we broke up  
\- it was like being hit on by guys and what i did was to judge them and understand do they understand CONSENT  
\- if was sleeping with someone for the first time none of them would ever think of fucking my ass or spitting/slapping or calling me names , you see it starts slow and normally with anyone unless for some relationships which were dom/sub from start  
\-if i was with someone and who is abusing my family at and not ready to stop while he is fucking me at such times i didnt have an option but to let me say or spank me and let the things get over, and then i made an excuse to leave and broke up with such guys because they didn't understand that NO or SAFE words,  
\- as i had mentioned i had boyfriends/affairs/flings/fwb/fuckboys/doms and masters  and some of these led into more than one time or into a dom/sub thing  
being the submissive for dom  
\- look at this , once i met a guy in a friend's party and he was hitting on me and get him off guard and then after exchanging numbers we started talking and then met for coffee/movie and had sex for a couple of times, this you can take a general scenario of how things happened  
\- now this guy if there is no feelings or he is just good for sex then i sometimes just met him for sex and based on his level of understanding it was clear that we were just friends with benefits or just fucking each other or dating and figuring out stuff  
\- about the submissive part, i told things like what does he thinks of calling names or dirty talking and telling stuff that one of my friend told her boyfriend did that to her and so on and based on how he responded i understood his type and knew what kind of person he is and then had that type of relationship with him  
\- about my reputation - so that was hardly a problem because of boys who like to boast of lie about things  
\- the way i was publicly, loved my teacher and good in studies, and famous in college, any guy who say that he was fucking me and no one could ever believe that, yes i was known to hang around but then i always excuses that i am just his friend and so on  
\- once it happened that one of the cheesy guys who cant handle rejection who was also the friend of my cousin sister told her that i was a slut and he had one night stand with me and that i had also fucked 3 of his other friends, now yes that was true but a truth that was only known to me and no evidence about it  
\- after one night stand with him, he was into me and being a psycho to have a relationship and and getting too much involved which i didn't wanted, and about his 3 friends, one of them whom we met sometimes for having ""fun"" and the other 2 where we dated but things didn't worked out - none of those 3 would tell such things about me  
\- this one night stand guy knew that i had dated the 2 of them but didn't knew what was the dept of our relationship nor he was sure that the other guy was my fuckboy but he just assumed because he was one of those who couldn't see me hang out with others and wanted me all for himself. and such guys are never for me  
\- so even in college, if one of my friend asked me did i fucked a particular guy, i just say no and that we were just meeting to discuss some assignment of he needed some help and we girls always amongst ourselves that guys tend to lie but a coffee means only to have a nice time and enjoy the attention and it was actually true, because the initial thing about knowing a guy helped me to decide to go ahead with him or not  
\- sometimes while talking to a guy , i said things like you are very controlling or you are dominant only to those i felt and with some discussions were about bdsm or about controlling boyfriends or feminism, etc and those things gave me an idea about the guy that how much of a dom he is and then being with such men things naturally happened but with time as i direct;y/indirectly started telling things or started being submissive  
\- it was never a defined that he was my dom or i was his sub but understood and sometimes it was clarified as we got more involved  
\- there is something known as sub space where i be a submissive and other time it's about being his friend/ companion , etc , those who understand this will know and others its ok  
being shared/pimped  
\- here is not that i was just open to sleep around with anyone that my bf/dom wanted but it happened slowly based on how much control i gave up to him or how much submissive i was for him  
\- so with one guy it started with he telling his friends about that he is with me and then telling what we did and then telling that in front of me  
\- sometimes it was we all going out and he touching me in front of them or they holding my hands i let them as it was just holding hands  
\- durings drinks or parties - playing games like giving  his friend a lap dance or kissing / or games like truth and dare were some of more reasons  
\- sometimes i cheated or he cheated and then we openly discussed, sometimes we discussed his friend is really into me  
\- it started with me sucking him in the hall when his friend came in and then me letting him jack of looking at us, or my bf/dom asking me why don't i suck him  
\- so this is how it happened and why i did it - it was to please my dom... depending upon how much he made me his submissive i did things for him, like once he was travelling and told me to keep his friend happy and i fucked him and such things happened more with some of guys which made my sexual numbers so high  
\- there is very slight difference between sharing and pimping for me i was pleasing his friend/cousin or the boss but later i knew that it was not just for sexual favours but the men i did it for were taking money in exchange of this.  
\- though i did please the men for my dom/master but it was not that i was like some hooker but the men whom i met and was introduced  and then later i pleased them. at times i straight way said no and also denied to men i did not feel right with  
more things  
\- when being a live in slut for being a weekend slut with masters there were house parties where i served the drinks and food and there were times when i pleased some of his friends in pvt  
\- also there were times when i was like pleasing a group of dom and his friends, like it was with one of them where i and his close friends had gangbangs, it actaully depended upon the chemistry and level of understanding amongst all of us  
\- talking about gangbangs - i just love all the attention i get and the way all the men just get pleased while caling names and also all the talks/ fun and sex we have, the roleplays, having my mouth and cunt/ass fucked ie me taking 2 cocks at a time while others wait for their turns and giving me all the attention , that is a feeling i cant explain.  
\- with a group its also more secured when we in public to do naughty things because of the cover, like giving a blowjob on the highway was better when i was sucking one and the other men surrounded and covered us and i sucked them one by one, with group its about getting all the attention and knowing that i am pleasing the master and his friends who are also like my dom but internally i know that i am doing it for him  
\-sometimes it was to increase the prestige and image of my man amongst his friends/office but it was all for him that i did it for  
financial domination  
\-  one of my doms explained this to me clearly and i realized that right from the beginning when i was paying for the movie/coffe dates or food bills for my partners i was being financially dominated  
\- he explained that there are rarely any women who will do this or be shared or pimped and go this far to please and serve their and dom and its upto me to do this  
\- he told that to please a man is not just sexually serving him or cooking for him and being his domestic slut/slave but also pleasing him in all ways and that means pleasing other men for him and also paying him or bringing him money  
\- there were some doms with whom i parted my pocket money with some my salary(partial or a full)  
\- and again this i only did to please and serve him and be his submissive but not with all only a few who and that much dominance on me  
why i did this  
\- you see there are some men who are so mean dominating and made me so much submissive for them that for them i was ready to please other men because that pleased them,  because it pleased my master to have his uncle/cousin be sexually served i did it  
\- its not that all the times it was open but also was done in a way where it didn't looked that i was being shared/pimped, , like with of the uncles of my master that he wanted me to please him , i just happened to have an encounter with him and act slutty and pleased him, sometimes it was me meeting his cousin in a bar and blowing up in the restroom  
\- there were times when it was known to the men that i was the submissive/gf/slut of my master who was their friend/colleague/relative/cousin or sometimes they didn't knew  
\- with few i knew that this man is just paying my dom to use me sexually because of our conversations but then master explained that i was anyways doing it for him and i must not care if he is taking money , and i got his point,  
\- plus men who did that told that this was a way of their domination and the control they have on me and i on the other hand was happy to please them plus i was enjoying sex  
\- the thing is that with all of my sexual encounter - be the the 1 night stands my boyfriends or the men i was pimped / shared to - for most of them i was like someone who they couldn't imagine in their wildest dreams , hardly anyone of they thought that i would be so sexy/sluty/submissive and i enjoyed to please them and shock  
\- most of them couldn't handle my sluttyness and i loved to play with them- many times in role plays also.  
\- there were a few who could sexually satisfy me but then as long as they were pleased and my dom/master praised me and appreciated me that was all i wanted, the feeling of happiness and satisfaction on the face of my dom while he telling me how pleased he because his boss/cousin was very happy with me - that made me do it  
\- the reasons for breakups and the type of relationship i had are already mentioned in my previous posts you can check them there  
some more about me  
\- many of you say that i am like a slut and enjoy rimming or being shared , it's not that all the things that i do or i have done was because i enjoyed it but i did it for my dom/master  
\- yes i do like to called sluty names and being laughed and humiliated but there are a lot of things that i may not enjoy but do it only and only to please my dom  
\- many used to wake me up in the middle of the night just because they were horny and wanted me to put a rest to their cock  
\- some doms were so mean that when they felt itching between their legs they woke me so that i can lick their balls / cock and that area rather than them scratching and satisfying their itching and then it ended up me sucking/rimming them or sometimes it was just a few licks and back to sleep  
\- i have been a live in slut also and sometimes at his place and sometimes at my place ,and that is a completely different thing because it allows a lot of time together, be it showering together at times or pleasing the dom in many other ways ""domestic servitude""  
\-that involved cooking, doing his dishes, putting the clothes to laundry, keep the house as per his likes and pleasing in multiple other ways, thought i used the washing machine but hand washed his underwear and surprising him with his favorite food  
\- those who think that we are naked at all times in home then you wrong, it's like being together like all other couples but more of submissive/dom styles, its not just the physical aspect but the mental aspect of pleasing and serving your dom  
\- there were accepts like being the party host and different ways of waking him and things to do while sleeping/ greeting and saying bye and all that was so much fun while living a normal life for the world but being a submissive and pleasing you dom secretly  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
i just mentioned few things that were mostly asked to me and i think this will tell you all more about me but only if you have read the other things about me",DesiInterfaith,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiInterfaith/comments/pd7hpi/opening_up_more_about_myself/,Story/Confession,sexyysluttydaisyy,pd7hpi,/r/DesiInterfaith/comments/pd7hpi/opening_up_more_about_myself/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiInterfaith/comments/pd7hpi/opening_up_more_about_myself/,0,2021-08-28

Looking for a lady to empty my thick 9 inch morning wood load into. I‚Äôve been pent up for a while now and need a release. Couple of ideas:

You‚Äôre my roommate walking into my room in the morning to see my pillar sticking straight up with the blankets on. You may be curious as to what is actually under there. Did I leave a water bottle or was I really packing that much? Curiosity gets the best of you and you decide to make your way into my room. What happens if I wake up? Or will I?

My step mom is cleaning the house only to open the door to find that stiff cock as I lay there sound asleep. What will she do? Have a go or move on? My room does need attention, do you try and clean around that aching morning wood that was throbbing, taunting you. 

We have guests over and I had to give up my room. Our parents told us to sleep together like old times. I wake up next to my step sister only to start with light cuddles into slipping it into her to give her a morning pounding. We have to keep it down because we aren‚Äôt the only ones home. Are we both too sleepy to realize what‚Äôs happening or do we know what‚Äôs going on and just go with it?

My hot aunt is visiting and I just can‚Äôt get enough of her. She catches me checking her out and decides to keep teasing until I make a move or she makes a move. Whether it‚Äôs finding a reason to bend over right in front of me or rubbing my leg during family dinner, or even rubbing something else. Things get very hot and carried away. Can we keep it a secret?

Yoga - love this one. I walk in on you doing yoga or I‚Äôm relaxing on the couch and you‚Äôre doing yoga. I can‚Äôt help but start commenting then maybe I help you and things get a little carried away. Do you want to try a position where you need help? Do you catch me looking and tease or call me out?

I don‚Äôt care of the roles, let me pick or shoot me a message with what you are to me. My only requirement is to be attentive. I am pretty good with responses, I expect the same. If your goal is to ghost me after a few messages don‚Äôt bother. 

Kinks not required just to help you brainstorm.
Kinks: dominating, incest, build up, risky sex, vanilla, teasing, feet, clothed sex, protection, condom removal, big loads 

Hard no: blood, gore, piss

Message me your age, name, and description or reference. 

**bonus points if you start the scene in your first post but not required 

If you message me to are accepting that you are 18+",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pd7tml/m4f_morning_wood/,RP,redditbrowser239,pd7tml,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pd7tml/m4f_morning_wood/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pd7tml/m4f_morning_wood/,0,2021-08-28
I might become a sex slave soon,"In under a week, my parents will drop me off at college. They don‚Äôt know this, but shortly after they drop me off, I‚Äôm going to walk off campus, meet up with another guy, and get in his car.

The plan is for him to drive me to his house for sex. He lives far away in a state I‚Äôve never been to. The drive is 12 hours from my college, and 21 hours from my home state. He will be the only transportation I have; I won‚Äôt be able to leave without him driving me.

He works remotely and lives alone, so there‚Äôs essentially no risk that we‚Äôll be interrupted.

Nobody knows where I‚Äôm going, who I‚Äôm going with, or how long I‚Äôm supposed to be gone. In fact, nobody knows that I‚Äôm getting picked up by this guy at all. He knows I‚Äôm keeping it a secret too.

This guy is five inches taller than me. He‚Äôs a lot heavier than me, and he appears way stronger. He could easily overpower me.

I *just* turned 18, but he‚Äôs roughly twice my age. He also knows that I‚Äôm a virgin and that I‚Äôm trusting and innocent. He said I have everything he wants in a guy.

I know he‚Äôs got fantasies about restraining someone and forcing them to take it. I told him that I fantasize about being on the receiving end of that. I agreed to let him do it; I haven‚Äôt brought up a safeword. 

When we get to his house, he‚Äôs going to strip me naked and restrain me. He‚Äôs probably going to handcuff me or tie my wrists to his bedposts. We decided to do this somewhere private like in a windowless room. Naturally, he‚Äôll be holding onto my cell and anything else I bring.

Just to recap: I‚Äôm secretly running away with a man who could easily overpower me and who fantasizes about holding young guys captive. We‚Äôre going to an unfamiliar place that‚Äôs very far away. I‚Äôm going to be physically restrained and unable to leave or call for help.

There‚Äôs a real possibility that I‚Äôm being lured into sexual slavery. He could easily decide to never let me out of the restraints, and I‚Äôd have no way to stop him. Nobody would ever find out.

Before you start worrying for me, though, let me say this: I kinda want to become a sex slave. I‚Äôve seriously thought about it for several years. I‚Äôm too nervous to ask someone to abduct me, so instead, I‚Äôm putting myself in situations where it‚Äôs likely to happen. If it does happen, I‚Äôm gonna accept my new life. Don‚Äôt try to convince me otherwise.

If I don‚Äôt post again from here, it might be because I‚Äôm bound and gagged in a sex dungeon.

WD MyCloud Duo Config Support Request,"Hi,  


I bought a WD MyCloud Home Duo a while ago, for the main purpose of setting up a Plex server.  I have been drawn to Jellyfin for the added benefit of being able to add M3U files for Live TV, which is a great feature.  


What I am struggling with is understanding how to use the NAS drive I have to configure JellyFin without the need for my PC to be on.  I want to mirror the way the NAS manages and supports Plex.  


Anyone got any suggested installation steps?  I have looked at 'Docker' but I have no experience for that and it appears there is no bin file for my NAS.  


Thanks in advance",jellyfin,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jellyfin/comments/pd74i0/wd_mycloud_duo_config_support_request/,Help Request,schubs-long,pd74i0,/r/jellyfin/comments/pd74i0/wd_mycloud_duo_config_support_request/,https://www.reddit.com/r/jellyfin/comments/pd74i0/wd_mycloud_duo_config_support_request/,0,2021-08-28
"(Tw/Gr00ming, gaslighting) I want to cut contact with my dad but my family won't allow it because ""he's my father"".","I'm 16 and my parents divorced a couple years ago due to my dad being unfaithful. Everything seemed ok until near the end when he started being shady and secretive. I live with my mum and my dad never really comes into contact with me unless either my mum argues with him or when it benefits him ( he likes to make out like he's such an amazing dad on Facebook only to slander my entire family behind their backs and then runs away with his tail in between his legs when he's called out on his bs ) but that's not the main reason why I want to cut contact with him.

There was an incident where I was groomed ( I was 11 at the time ) and my dad literally turned around and told me that it was my fault and was talking about how stupid I was when all I wanted was to actually feel loved by someone ( I was being severely bullied and had crippling self esteem issues and on top of that my mum was suffering with depression so whenever I went to go to her I would always feel as if I'm making her worse ) and whenever I brought it up he would always be like ""I NeVeR SAiD ThAT"" or ""ThAT DiDNt HaPPeN"".

 There has been a few occasions where he has called me selfish for literally no reason like when I went somewhere without a jacket thinking it was going to be warm when in actuality it wasn't and his gf gave me her jacket instead even when I told her she didn't need to and apparently that makes me selfish because ""ShE'S GoINg To FrEezE"" and it's my fault because I didn't take a jacket and she was kind enough to offer when I *repeat* REFUSED TO TAKE THE JACKET BUT SHE GAVE ME IT ANYWAY. Again, when I mention that, ""ThaT NEvEr HApPEnEd"" and ""I NeVEr SaID ThAT"". He also called me selfish when I added a pc to my wishlist because ""I ShOUlD KnOW He CAnT AfFOrD It"", I even told him he didn't have to get me it for whatever reason, that's why it's called a wishlist. Again, ""NEvEr HApPEnEd, DidnT SaY tHat"".
There was also a time where he not only called me selfish but also told me that ""ThE WoRlD DoeSnT RevOLVe ARoUnD ME"" when I asked him if he could pick me up from my aunt's because she lives near a very shady area and it was dark yet he expected me to walk home on my own ( my aunt couldn't come because my 4 yo cousin was in bed and she couldn't call a taxi because she couldn't afford to ). I know the world doesn't revolve around me but it doesn't hurt to pick up your own daughter to make sure she gets home safely. Again, ""ThaT NEvEr HApPEnEd, DidnT SaY tHat"". This time when I confronted him about it ( i said I had screenshots ), he left the room for a minute and came back and said to me, ""I SaY ThINgS I DoNt MeAn WhEn IM AnGRY"" and when I asked him what he had to be angry about, he changed the subject and went on about how we demonize him for no reason and ""He'S SuCH A GoOD dAD"".

He told me that I need to go into a school for special needs because ""I'm autistic"" when I was never actually diagnosed but it was suspected. As soon as they said it was suspected he immediately started making out that I need severe help with it when I really don't. He went on about how I'm ""SuFfERiNg"" from it when I'm really not but ever since they suspected autism, he has been trying to gaslight me even more. Again though, ""ThaT NEvEr HApPEnEd, NEvEr SaID ThAT"". 

But wait, there is a cherry to go on top. A couple of weeks ago, my dad's gf posted something saying about how he's really stepped up to be a father towards her kids, nothing bad right? Well, the way she worded it made it sound like he doesn't already have his own kids. What's worse is that everyone on my dad's gf's side of the family ( clearly he never even talked to them about us ) was praising him and talking about how proud they are. He treats those kids more like his own than he does his own kids. If we ask him to do something for us, it will be like we tried to cut his legs off but if her kids ask him to do something, he will be there at the drop of a hat. This isn't the first time either, every gf he's had it's like he's trying to replace us.

I really want to cut contact with him but nobody in my family wants me to because apparently I love him deep down when in reality I've had enough. I no longer see him as my dad, I'm not even sure if I should call him my dad anymore. He hasn't just gaslit me but also gaslit my brother and sister and treated them like crap too but even they are on board with staying in contact with him. Being around him makes me mentally drained even though he claims that ""HiS AuRA HEaLs PEoPLe"" ( he's gotten into spirituality but uses it as an excuse to be selfish because according to him if he believes in it hard enough, the universe will revolve around him ). It doesn't help either that people use his upbringing as an excuse to why he is the way he his ( his dad left him but he worships him like a god and his mum was never really there for him but has since apologised and tried to be there for him recently but now she disowned him because of his vile behaviour ).",Vent,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/pd7fzx/twgr00ming_gaslighting_i_want_to_cut_contact_with/,,mythiccthemysticc,pd7fzx,/r/Vent/comments/pd7fzx/twgr00ming_gaslighting_i_want_to_cut_contact_with/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/pd7fzx/twgr00ming_gaslighting_i_want_to_cut_contact_with/,0,2021-08-28
"to you. (starts bad, gets better)","Always to have and never to hold

You began to feel like home

You took away a piece of me

Then fled the scene and wiped it clean

Tore out my heart and took with you the key

What a cruel trick, as if you still need me

How come I still manage to take the blame

When you are the one that left me in all this pain.

&amp;#x200B;

Told me things, made it seem like forever

But ‚Äúfavourite‚Äù to you must also mean never.

I feel pathetic and small as you flaunt your apathy

It‚Äôs so easy for you, to do this so casually

Can‚Äôt help but feel that you picked me at random

But my heart opened up for you and you left it abandoned

You needed a distraction, and that‚Äôs what I provided

But it‚Äôs hard to hate someone who made you feel so alive

&amp;#x200B;

and I truly believe that I will never mean

As much to you as what you did to me

As much as she will always mean to you

I was second, maybe even third, yet what I told you was true

‚Äúyou‚Äôve got no competition‚Äù I said with complete candour

But my effort was one sided, and disappointment much greater

You broke me, and that‚Äôs not what hurt the most

You moved on to two others, while I was still engrossed.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I feel better, and sometimes it comes back

The memories just bring heartache and make me feel like I lack

What it is that you want, 

or what it is that you need

Maybe you just want none of me.

I felt awake for the first time, when you admitted to me

That you couldn‚Äôt help but smile in my vicinity

Since then, it‚Äôs been you, every minute of every day

Not excited, but at home

I felt like I was done searching for a way.

&amp;#x200B;

As the memories of you move further away

I break my heart again and again just to stop the fray

I‚Äôm confused and upset at my lack of pride 

why would I love someone who only made me cry? 

I feel okay, but maybe I‚Äôm just pretending

This is not what I meant when I hoped for never ending.

Tore out my heart and took the key, 

what a cruel trick, but you can‚Äôt have me.",Poem,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poem/comments/pd9f2r/to_you_starts_bad_gets_better/,,Snoo_26345,pd9f2r,/r/Poem/comments/pd9f2r/to_you_starts_bad_gets_better/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poem/comments/pd9f2r/to_you_starts_bad_gets_better/,0,2021-08-28

"I want a relationship with my mother, but she just doesn't care.","This is a long story. I needed to rant. But I think its worth the read.

My mom was strict on me about dating and said I wasn't ALLOWED to date anyone until after college. I ended up getting a boyfriend when I was 19 and kept it a secret for months. I didn't want to keep hiding it so I told my mother and she said I either had to break up with him or I had to move out. I told her that I would move in with my dad(their divorced) in the morning cause I wasn't going to break up with someone just cause my mommy said so. When I went to my room she came in and demanded that I give her my phone. I said 'no' since I pay for my own phone bill and she didn't buy the phone. She than gave me the ultimatum to either give her the phone OR to get out the house NOW. I knew she just wanted to grasp some amount of power over me so I choose the ultimatum of getting out now cause I wasn't going to give her that power. I called one of my closest girlfriend's and she immediately came to get me. This was all at 12am so my dad was sleeping and didn't answer the phone when I called. (My friend knew I was gonna tell my mom and stayed up just incase this happened. We kinda knew it would) As she was on her way over my mom watched me as I packed clothes and shoes into boxes. (We were also about to move during all this) When my friend got to my house, she helped me load her car with the couple of boxes and we left. My mom and her husband called me in the morning and picked me up from my friends house to take me back home. She acted like nothing happened at all. She knew I broke that boundary and didn't demand that I break up anymore but I was so pissed that she acted like nothing happened. My mom does still say she doesn't like him because he is rude and disrespectful. I don't know what conversation was had but I know he was defending me as an adult back on the night she kicked me out so I don't know if he was really rude to her or not. Than again, she says she doesn't like my friend who picked me up and her reasoning is because she didn't greet her when she came to get me. (-_-). Yes, she doesn't like my friend because she didn't say hi as I was getting kicked out. üôÉ. Cool.

Now to the present. I'm 21 and I am still with my boyfriend and I am still living with my mom. My boyfriend bought me a ring for my birthday but it was a late birthday gift. There is a meaning behind it which is that we know we will get married just not until a few years from now. It's like a promise ring. This morning I wanted to show my mom cause it was something that made me happy and I wanted to share that with her. (Qs toxic as my mother is, I try to have a relationship with her). I showed her and she said nothing and proceeded to ask me why he got it for me. I told her ""just because"", cause I was waiting for her to say something like ""that was nice"" or ""its pretty"" or even ""thats cool"". I know my dad wouldn't care about it but he would say something nice to be polite. She made faces about it which were upsetting me so I asked her ""do you think you'll be invited to my wedding if I do end up marrying him?"" She then said ""I don't care. Don't invite me. Don't invite me to your snotty wedding."" I told her that she should care because she should want to be at my wedding. I started crying because it was important to me since I want to have a relationship with her. And she was telling me that she didn't even care. She told me that I was being rude and that she has no problem dishing out what I serve. I told her the only reason I asked was because everytime I tell her I don't like when she makes rude or snarky remarks about my relationship or boyfriend, she continues to do so. So I asked her a question that I assumed would make her think about what she says to me. I feel like if I never asked her the question, than she would continue to make remarks about him, making me not want to invite her to my wedding even more.",toxicparents,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/pdd82h/i_want_a_relationship_with_my_mother_but_she_just/,Rant/Vent,samsungluvea,pdd82h,/r/toxicparents/comments/pdd82h/i_want_a_relationship_with_my_mother_but_she_just/,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/pdd82h/i_want_a_relationship_with_my_mother_but_she_just/,0,2021-08-28
Pokemon! Discord Version: Book 2," **By: Damion James Havoc**

**Chapter 1** 

As Warden Liander fled through the brisk night sky, flying upon his pokemon partner Corvinight, he couldn‚Äôt believe what had just taken place. ‚ÄúThis is impossible! How could I have let something like this happen?! Who were those children?! What did they want with that lowlife Pence and his mangey pack of degenerates?! There‚Äôs no doubt that something foul is brewing, some kind of resistance maybe? And the angry spirit that attacked me, there‚Äôs no mistaking it now. That spirit was Prince Adonis Nova, he‚Äôs back and he wants his revenge! I must make it to the Citadel to inform King Xalis. The return of Prince Adonis Nova, The Speed Devil.. In life, he was wickedly powerful but now in death, his power has exhumed his grave. Adonis has become a monster, a true abomination of nature. My dear king, what have you done?‚Äù Liander said as he grew closer to the Team Rocket Citadel Islands. \*Static\* He switched his communicator from map to radio mode and attempted a mayday distress signal. ‚ÄúMayday! This is Warden Liander Gilvette, Senior Admiral. Currently approaching Big Crimson! Requesting immediate consultation with the king! I repeat! Requesting immediate consultation with the king! Big Crimson, please respond.‚Äù He said to his communicator. \*Static\* ‚ÄúThis is Big Crimson to Admiral. Please stand by‚Ä¶. \*Static\* Opening hangar doors now. Admiral, your Corvinight mount is clear for entry.‚Äù replied a voice from his radio signal. Liander guided his Corvinight in through the hangar doors and landed as the doors quickly shut behind them. 

‚ÄúAdmiral, sir!‚Äù A few Citadel Agents stood at attention with formal salutes as Liander unmounted Corvinight. ‚ÄúAt ease men. Corvinight, return to me.‚Äù Liander said as he returned Corvinight to it‚Äôs pokeball. ‚ÄúAdmiral sir, King Xalis will be right with you.‚Äù Said Advisor Damascus Marron as he stepped out from the shadows. ‚ÄúWell now! Senior Scribe Damascus Marron, is that really you? It‚Äôs been ages, how have you been, old friend?‚Äù Liander says to Damascus. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Advisory Head Damascus now my friend, I‚Äôve been well. It seems from the looks of things you cannot say the same, I‚Äôm assuming?‚Äù Damascus replied. Before Liander could say anything, King Xalis interrupted and said, ‚ÄúAdmiral! What is the meaning of this distress signal!?‚Äù Damascus and Liander then walked over to the steel conference circle and were seated after the King had sat down at the head of the table. ‚ÄúMy liege, I apologize for my sudden intrusion. I regret to inform you that my prison tower within Siren City has been destroyed and reduced to rubble. Most of my guard force and prisoners were killed in the exchange. After two rogue agents infiltrated the tower, they attempted to release the remaining Shade operatives from my custody.‚Äù Liander explained. \*Punch!\* ‚ÄúArrggghhhh!‚Äù King Xalis then punched Liander in the face so hard that he flew back at least twenty feet through the palace corridor. While leaving a trail of blood with a few teeth that were almost completely shattered, Liander was dazed for a moment but quickly regained his composure. ‚ÄúMy new arm is working at capacity, wouldn‚Äôt you say Damascus?‚Äù The King said while admiring his arm that he created using the DNA and cellular tissue of Mew, the pokemon of origin. 

The skin was translucent with a violet coloration while the veins and organic tissue would glow fluorescent purple showing grotesquely through the skin. ‚ÄúIt works well now, however we still have a few blood conversion tests to undergo before it will perform at its fullest.‚Äù Damascus replied. ‚ÄúHahaha! Yes. It won‚Äôt be much longer until all of the blood running through my body will be replaced with the blood of Mew!‚Äù King Xalis said as he then focused his attention back on Liander who was trying his best to get back onto his feet. The king walks over to Liander angrily and lifts him up by his throat, squeezing tight with his grotesque modified arm. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre meaning to tell me that one of my most secure facilities in all of Agoria was successfully infiltrated by only two rogue agents!? Who are these impossibly skilled agents who were able to best you and the entirety of your guard force that were on duty!? And what of Silus Pence!? Where is that traitorous dog now!?‚Äù King Xalis exploded with anger as he put Liander down and let him speak. ‚ÄúWell my liege, unfortunately Pence and his operatives managed to escape my grasp. The identity of the two agents are currently unknown but they appeared to be children. One of them had snow white hair and used dragon type pokemon, the other was skilled with projectile blades and explosives, he also used the Eon Spirit Sylveon as his pokemon partner. But that‚Äôs just the thing! It wasn‚Äôt the two rogue agents that destroyed the tower, it was a very angry spirit. My king, I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this without sounding entirely mad. King Xalis, the spirit of Adonis has returned.‚Äù Liander said hyperventilating as the King turned completely white and his expression changed from angry to stunned in seconds.

‚ÄúWhat did you just say to me, Admiral?‚Äù The King replied more calmly this time. ‚ÄúMy liege, there was no mistaking it. I am absolutely certain the spirit that destroyed the tower was Prince Adonis.‚Äù Said Liander desperately. Damascus looked at Liander with pure fear written across his face. ‚ÄúAdmiral, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs impossible. We recovered the Prince‚Äôs remains after the massacre of Sector 66. He and his team were given a most respectable funeral. He was honored as a legendary hero among Team Rocket ranks. Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt one of Pence‚Äôs men that may have only looked similar to Adonis?‚Äù Damascus asked with a shivering fear throughout his words. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand Damascus! The phantom blade Aegislash hung from his back and the markings caused by the contract littered his pale phantom flesh! Before he spared my life he spoke to me, his words were as cold as death and freezing black fire danced around his very essence! I looked into his eyes! Those blood red eyes of death.. It's‚Ä¶ It's an omen.. A bad, bad omen! He truly possessed the eyes of Lord Xiro! \*Flashes back to Anzu Adonis\* Lord Xiro used those eyes to peer into the Distortion World and defeat the Dark Lord Giratina! Do you have any idea what a dark and vengeful spirit could do with that kind of power!? He‚Äôs come back to our world and has become horrendously powerful, my liege! He‚Äôs back and he‚Äôs coming for us all!‚Äù Liander was then quickly cut off by King Xalis slamming his fist down on the table. ‚ÄúEnough! Let me think for a goddamn second! If this is true, then we must take all the proper precautions! Admiral, you will log the descriptions and last known locations of the two child infiltrators into the communicator, don‚Äôt spare any details whatsoever. I want them found and I want them found soon. Gamma Squad will patch you into their frequency and you will give them access to your description files. Damascus, you will dispatch Gamma Squad for an extraction mission immediately. Gamma Squad will secure the children and bring them to me, I have quite a few questions for them.‚Äù Xalis explained. 

‚ÄúSir.‚Äù Damascus said as he made his way to the command center. ‚ÄúAdmiral Liander. I want you to return to Siren City and begin the reconstruction project of the Prison Tower. I will dispatch a group to assist you in a few hours along with a replacement guard force, until then you will clean up your goddamn mess. This is your last chance Liander. If I find out you‚Äôre lying about any of this, you will spend the remainder of your miserable days undergoing dangerous and painful cellular experimentation. Are we clear, Admiral!?"" said Xalis. ‚ÄúY..Yes sir!‚Äù Liander said shakily. ‚ÄúGood, now begone from me and be quick about getting back to your city.‚Äù Xalis said as Liander summoned Corvinight again and began making his way back to Siren City. It seems Gamma Team will now carry out their priority orders which are to extract and detain Aiden and Blythe. The Gamma Team consisted of seven elite Team Rocket members. These elites were trained extensively in stealth and extremely low profile missions. The Gamma Team were known as the ghosts of Team Rocket, while carrying out jobs they usually would be in and out without a trace. They wear full face masks and dark hoods so discovering a member‚Äôs identity is almost impossible. They were always trained to off themselves before compromising the discovery of their true identity. One key thing about this group is that every one of its members dedicates training to primarily ghost type pokemon, as training among ghosts is the way to become the most elusive. \*Sounds of shuffling\* ‚ÄúHuh? What? What‚Äôs going on? Aiden!? Hey! Put him down!‚Äù Blythe yelled as he awoke to Gamma Squad surrounding their camp site.They had used a rag doused in chloroform to keep Aiden unconscious. Then one of the members scooped Aiden up and threw him over his shoulder. Quickly one of the Gamma Squad members grabbed Blythe from behind and shoved the rag in his face. ‚ÄúHyaaaahh!‚Äù Blythe yelled out as he twisted around quickly and pushed the member back and attempted to charge his secrets of nature energy. ‚ÄúWhat!? No!? It‚Äôs still night time!? Damn it!‚Äù He yelled as he failed to charge his energies to try and stop Gamma Squad. 

\*Dash!\* He then bolted into the thick snowy woods using the microscopic amount of energy he had left. \*Swoop\* \*Swoop\* The member of Gamma Squad that had Aiden secured then began to make his way back to the rendezvous point while the other six members and their ghost pokemon focused on Blythe and chased him through the woods. \*Blythe‚Äôs Thoughts\* ‚ÄúShit! Who the hell are these guys?! This isn‚Äôt good! I have to save Aiden! All of our pokemon and gear are still back at the campsite! I need to shake these guys but I‚Äôm almost completely out of energy! Shit! What do I do!?‚Äù Blythe thought to himself as the hooded Gamma Squad cornered him, surrounding Blythe on all sides. ‚ÄúWell come on then! If you want to fight! Then come and get it!‚Äù Blythe yelled as he realized he was out of options. Then one of the duskull shot a shadow ball at Blythe that sounded like a bullet zipping through the air. \*Swoop!\* \*Shing!\* Out of nowhere and to Blythe's surprise, Ephriam dashed in front of the shadow ball using his secrets of nature and blocked the attack, catching it on one of his blades. \*Shiiiiinnnnggg!\* ‚ÄúHyaaaaaaahh!‚Äù Ephriam yelled out as he infused his energy with the shadow ball that he caught and made it bigger, causing it to shine with blinding lights. ‚ÄúLightforce, Sword!‚Äù \*Echoes!\* \*Swish!\* \*Crash!\* He launched the now massive and brightly shining orb back at the Duskull and it‚Äôs trainer, causing them and a few other enemies to burn alive in almost an instant. ‚ÄúEphriam!? Is that you!?‚Äù Blythe said as Ephriam looked back at Blythe and cut his eyes. ‚ÄúWhere are your pokemon partners?‚Äù Ephriam asked. ‚ÄúBack at camp, these guys took my friend and chased me all the way here! I have to help Aiden! He could be in real trouble!‚Äù Blythe replied as he and Ephriam both dodged an oncoming attack. 

\*Swoop!\* The remaining Gamma Squad members went to attack Blythe and Ephriam. ‚ÄúGrrr, here!‚Äù Ephriam said as he tossed Blythe one of his blades and summoned Noivern. As Blythe caught the blade, he quickly side stepped one of the Gamma Squad members and was able to connect his blade with her throat, successfully cutting her down. ‚ÄúWoah! Is that, Noibat!? He‚Äôs huge now!‚Äù Blythe asked, amazed at Noibat‚Äôs intense evolution. Ephriam backflipped over the last two members and landed behind them while simultaneously cutting through their kneecaps, slicing one solid direction then coming back the other direction to cut through their necks, severing both of their heads instantly. The death of their trainers caused the remaining enemy pokemon to disappear and flee from the battle. ‚ÄúHe evolved, Blythe, he‚Äôs Noivern now. You know, evolution. The thing that every living creature does eventually while undergoing growth. That is, every living creature besides you. It seems no matter how many mistakes you make, you never learn your lesson. Why did you run away like this Blythe? You know how much trouble I went through to find you?‚Äù Ephriam said to Blythe as he snatched his blade back from him and sheathed his weapons. ‚ÄúLook Ephriam, I don‚Äôt have time for this! I need to save Aiden. They took him! I need to tell Anzu! Where the hell was Anzu for all that!? Why didn‚Äôt he show up!? What the hell is going on!?‚Äù Blythe said in frustration and worry as he began to run back to camp to retrieve his gear and pokemon. Ephriam mounted Noivern and followed Blythe back to camp. ‚ÄúWait a second Blythe, did you say the name Anzu just then?‚Äù Ephriam asked Blythe. ‚ÄúYea, it‚Äôs kind of a long story. Anzu is this weird spirit that floats around Aiden or something and helps us on our missions. But for some reason he left us high and dry in that last situation and I have no idea why! Now Aiden‚Äôs missing and he doesn‚Äôt even have his pokemon to help him!‚Äù Blythe says as he gathers all of their things and gears up. While doing this he noticed Aiden‚Äôs belt only had two pokeballs on it.

‚ÄúWait, he‚Äôs got Sylveon with him! That‚Äôs good, but still! They knocked him unconscious with some kind of chemical! We have to help him big bro! Please! You‚Äôll help me with this, won‚Äôt you!?‚Äù Blythe pleaded to Ephriam. ‚ÄúSee Blythe, this is what I'm talking about. You mustn't involve yourself with the world outside of our community, and this is the perfect example as to why. Why do you think we have rules set in place for us to follow? There is a reason we must obey our father and our clan, Blythe. We can‚Äôt simply help everyone that needs it, it‚Äôs just not plausible anymore. Don‚Äôt you see Blythe, this world is tarnished by Team Rocket. It‚Äôs too far gone for any of us to save, we need to focus on what‚Äôs important, we need to preserve and appreciate what we have within our clan.‚Äù Ephriam preached. ‚ÄúWow Ephriam, I thought you were better than that. I can‚Äôt believe you would look me in the face and preach to me like our father or one of the other cowardly elders. You know what Ephriam! I think you‚Äôre wrong! I think all of you are wrong! We come from one of the proudest and most powerful clans in existence! Aiden was right, all we do is sit comfortably up in our mountain and hide from danger, while the entire world around us suffers. That kid not only made his way from Hallow Town to try and convince us of an alliance but he did it with an Eevee and a Zubat alone. I battled him in front of our whole clan, I thought I had that battle in the bag but right when I least expected it he came back and wiped the floor with me! Ever since then, we‚Äôve done amazing things, faced impossible odds and have progressed a long long way. But through everything, everything leading up to this very moment, I believe in that kid. I believe in Aiden. And trust me, I‚Äôm not the only one either. That kid‚Äôs gonna change the world one day and I want to be right there beside him when he does it! I haven‚Äôt even known him very long but I‚Äôd die for him if I had to! Because that‚Äôs what it means to have friends! That‚Äôs what it means to have a unit! It means you would lay your life down to protect someone who‚Äôs precious to you! What‚Äôs the point in being strong if you only protect yourself? I believe in sharing my strength, isn‚Äôt that what being a pokemon warrior is all about? You and your pokemon partners, sharing each other's strength to create an even deadlier force.‚Äù Blythe said with touching confidence. 

‚ÄúBlythe... ‚Äú Ephriam said as he listened to Blythe with full attention as the sun slowly began rising. ‚ÄúAll I‚Äôm saying is that there‚Äôs a better path our clan could walk, a path to a brighter future. A brighter future not only for ourselves but for everyone else, people, pokemon and gods alike! Aiden needs our help and I‚Äôm going to help him, with or without you, big bro. And if you think I‚Äôm going back home with you after everything we‚Äôve accomplished on this journey so far, then you‚Äôre even more blind than I thought.‚Äù Blythe said in conclusion. ‚ÄúBlythe, I understand where you‚Äôre coming from little brother, I really do. But I must follow my convictions to death, you know this. It‚Äôs the path I‚Äôve chosen for myself, just as you chose yours. Though I respect this new found conviction in you, I still must insist that you come home with me. It‚Äôs my mission to bring you back and I‚Äôm going to do just that. One way or another.‚Äù Ephriam says as he unsheathes his blades and charges his secrets of nature in the faint sunrise. ‚ÄúHuh? Hmm.. Hahaha!‚Äù Blythe laughs. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù Ephriam says while in secrets of nature full cloak state. ‚ÄúI always knew it would come to this, you and me. Blade to blade.‚Äù Blythe says as he unsheathes his high frequency blade and charges his secrets of nature since the sunrise was barely giving off just enough light. ‚ÄúHyaaahhh!‚Äù Blythe yelled as he charged up into secrets of nature gauntlet mode, cloaking his arms and legs in his dense energies. ‚ÄúIf this is what it takes to save my friend, then let‚Äôs do this! Go! Axew! Shelgon!‚Äù Blythe yelled as he summoned Shelgon and Axew to the battle. ‚Äú\*Scoff\* I won‚Äôt even waste my pokemon‚Äôs strength in a battle like this. I can take anything you throw at me by myself. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve seen me at full power have you Blythe? In fact, now that I think about it, I don‚Äôt think you ever will ,little brother. Hya!‚Äù Ephriam said as he attempted to strike Blythe head on with deadly high speeds. 

\*Swoosh!\* \*Catch!\* ‚ÄúShelgon protect!‚Äù Blythe yelled as Ephriam‚Äôs attack was intercepted by Shelgon. ‚ÄúAxew! Dual Chop!‚Äù Axew then leaped from Blythe‚Äôs shoulder toward Ephriam. \*Swoosh!\* Ephriam spun rapidly through the air, successfully blocking Axew‚Äôs dual chop and kicked Axew to the ground. Suddenly as Ephriam looked up, he was face to face with Blythe in mid air. \*Strike!\* Blythe strikes and clashes blade to blade in mid air with Ephriam at high speeds. \*Ching!\* \*Cling!\* As they clash Blythe is standing toe to toe with Ephriam with a display of combat proficiency that is highly impressive to him. ‚ÄúYou certainly have grown since you‚Äôve been away, little brother. It‚Äôs a shame I‚Äôll have to end this battle here and now. Hyaaaaaahh!‚Äù Ephriam said as he charged his secrets of nature even more. Axew and Shelgon are now fainted and Blythe is on his last legs. ‚ÄúI can keep going, this isn‚Äôt over! I'll keep fighting until every bone in my body is broken! Hyaaaaahhh!‚Äù Blythe charges his secrets of nature to the point where he is almost emitting a full cloak. In an instant they both finish charging and fly at each other for one final intense clash. ‚ÄúHyaaaaaah!‚Äù ‚ÄúHyaaahh!‚Äù They yell as they clash and their impact leaves a small crater in the forest floor below them while both Blythe and Ephriam fly back into the opposite direction of each other. Broken trees and charred snow surrounded them as they battled. Ephriam gets up slowly and staggers closer to Blythe. ‚Äú\*Pant\* \*Pant\* Is that‚Ä¶ All you got big bro? I‚Äôm not \*Pant\* \*Pant\* Finished yet..‚Äù Blythe says while laying flat on his back and hyperventilating. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve lost.. \*Pant\* \*Pant\* You‚Äôre coming with me, Blythe.. \*Pant\* \*Pant\*‚Äù Ephriam says as he charges what remains of his energies and goes for Blythe one last time. \*Whip!\* \*Wrap\* \*Wrap\* ‚ÄúWhat the hell!?‚Äù Ephriam yelled out as what appeared to be tree vines that had slithered towards him wrapped his arms and legs individually, bounding him to a tree. He tried charging more energy out of desperation but in his weakened state he could barely move. 

‚ÄúHey little boy! Are you okay!? Did this man hurt you and your little pokemon!? Oh my gosh! Don‚Äôt worry, little white haired boy! I‚Äôm gonna get you out of here!‚Äù Suddenly a whimsical young woman in all black appeared to try and rescue Blythe. ‚ÄúHuh? \*Pant\* \*Pant\* Who are you?‚Äù Blythe asked, completely exhausted. ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Arahbella Augury! My coven lives within this small woodland village. Dissidia is our home and Team Rocket's never gonna change that. That‚Äôs why I protect those like you from Team Rocket scum like this strange man! Don‚Äôt worry little white haired boy! We‚Äôre gonna teach this evil man a lesson about picking on children, isn‚Äôt that right Murkrow!?‚Äù Said Arahbella. ‚ÄúMaaahh! Maah!‚Äù The Murkrow on her shoulder replied positively.  ‚ÄúUmm, my name is Blythe by the way.‚Äù Blythe said. The vines that wrapped Ephraim and bound him to the tree now covered his entire body and face, so he could not speak. Arahbella appeared to be controlling them, as she held her hands out towards the vines to make them move. ‚ÄúWhat? No! That‚Äôs not a member of Team Rocket, it‚Äôs my dumb big brother, Ephriam. We sort of got in a fight, you can let him go.‚Äù Blythe said to Arahbella. ‚ÄúOh! Hah! That explains why he's got snow white hair just like you do! You guys look very similar as well! Haha!‚Äù She giggled nervously and retracted the vines, releasing Ephriam. ‚ÄúThanks for the help though miss, but there‚Äôs someone out there that needs our help even more! My friend Aiden, he‚Äôs younger than me and he‚Äôs been kidnapped! He only has one of his pokemon partners on him and no gear at all! To top that all off Team Rocket are the ones who took him! We need to get him back! Will you help miss!? Please!?‚Äù Blythe explained. ‚ÄúIf someone needs our help then I'm all in! That's what Murkrow and I do after all! Did you see which way the people who took your friend went?‚Äù Arahbella said to Blythe. Ephriam gasped for air behind them as he got onto his feet. ‚ÄúWhat matter of entity are you!? How did you control the vines like that? Are you some kind of forest witch?‚Äù Ephriam asked. ‚ÄúHmm? Oh! You must be F-Ram, right!? F-Ram certainly is a strange name isn‚Äôt it? Hehehe!‚Äù Arahbella asked as she giggled.

‚ÄúMy name is EPHRIAM Lightsworn of the.. I mean.. I..‚Äù Ephriam started to introduce himself but then stopped after realizing that he shouldn‚Äôt tell someone he just met that he was from the Ancient Dragon Clan. ‚ÄúHmm? You remembered your name but forgot your title? What an airhead! Right Blythe? Hehehe!‚Äù Arahbella joked around with Blythe and Ephriam. ‚ÄúHah, yeah he is an air head. Hahaha! But wait! Look, I know we just met but I really do appreciate your help. Before we head out though I need to convince my brother to help too. Ephriam here is one of the best tracking experts our family has to offer! With his help we should be able to find Aiden in no time! Well, what‚Äôs the word, big bro? Did I show you how hard I've been working in my absence?‚Äù Blythe said. ‚Äú..... Fine. I‚Äôll help you. But once we get this kid back I‚Äôm leaving, got it? I‚Äôll go home and tell father you died or something. Happy now Blythe?‚Äù Ephriam said. ‚ÄúHah! Yes! Thank you so much! Big Bro! You won‚Äôt regret this. It‚Äôs decided then! The three of us will team up to get Aiden back from Team Rocket! Yeahh!‚Äù Blythe said with extreme excitement. ‚ÄúLook Blythe, you and I wore each other out pretty badly in that fight of ours. We should rest before we go and take on a highly skilled criminal organization. It would be redundant to confront them in the state we‚Äôre currently in.‚Äù Ephriam said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no time! If we wait any longer they could be way too far gone! We might not make it in time if we wait!‚Äù Blythe said with disappointment. ‚ÄúLook losers! Let me heal you guys!‚Äù Arahbella said. ‚Äú\*Sigh\* Our energy isn‚Äôt normal chi, we use the ancient technique known as the draconid secrets of nature. It would take thousands if not millions of potions to heal us in the state we're currently in. We really wore each other down to nothing in that last battle didn‚Äôt we? Blythe, I meant to tell you this before but, I‚Äôm really proud of you, little brother. You‚Äôre almost fully caught up to me. At your age, that‚Äôs no easy feat. I think you‚Äôve come a long way in a small amount of time, that‚Äôs very impressive, Blythe. I truly mean that.‚Äù Ephriam said. 

‚ÄúBig brother, I've never heard you compliment me before.. \*Clears throat\* Ahem. Thank you. Thank you Ephriam. You really honor me with your words big bro.‚Äù Said Blythe, trying not to get choked up. ‚ÄúUmm, hey dragon dummies. Of course I‚Äôm not going to use potions. You see, I don‚Äôt know if you noticed by now but I‚Äôm using a different type of energy as well. Controlling nature isn‚Äôt the only thing I can do. Here, let me show you!‚Äù Arahbella said as she prepared two blank spell tags. She laid them down on a tree stump and began to focus her energy. \*Rising Winds!\* The winds then blew rapidly and the snow cycloned around Arahbella as she cast her energies into the winds which then carried a bountiful breeze towards the spell tags. Arahbella‚Äôs purple eyes then began glowing brightly. She guided the snowy winds with her arms and the spell tags levitated towards Blythe and Ephriam. ‚ÄúBoth of you, hold out one hand.‚Äù She said as they held their hands out towards the spell tags. The wind picks up even more as the spell tags gently float into each of their palms then disappear into their skin. ‚ÄúWoah! What is this!?‚Äù Blythe yelled out in fear. ‚ÄúShh! It‚Äôs okay Blythe! Just accept the spell tag and it will grant you a permanent capacity boost to your secrets of whatever power! I promise!‚Äù Arahbella said, trying to reassure Blythe. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs really working! Hyaaahhh!‚Äù Ephriam said as he charged his secrets of nature at a much more rapid pace than he ever could before. ‚ÄúWow! For real!? It really works!? Let me try! Hyaaahh!!‚Äù Blythe said as he also charged himself instantly, feeling better than he ever had before in his entire lifetime. The winds then calmed themselves and everything went back to normal. ‚ÄúSee! I told you guys! My coven are transcendental witches! Our practice dates all the way back to ancient times so we're the last of our kind unfortunately. We use natural energy just like you guys!‚Äù Arahbella said with a cute smile. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs incredible. I‚Äôm impressed with this ability of yours. I think we'll make a fine team. Maybe our energy was meant to mesh with others after all.‚Äù Ephriam said. 

‚ÄúYeah! This is completely amazing! Haha! Thank you miss Arahbella! Thank you so much! Haha! Alright! I am fired the hell up now! I feel like nothing can stop us now! Guys, let‚Äôs go rescue Aiden! Team Rocket won‚Äôt stand a chance!‚Äù Blythe said with an intense confidence that he‚Äôs never felt before today. And so this newly formed team made it their goal to rescue Aiden from the clutches of Team Rocket. Ephraim being an expert tracker will no doubt get them on the right road quickly. Though still shrouded with mystery, Arahbella has turned out to be quite the powerful and dependable ally. With a team like this, Blythe has an excellent shot at saving his friend. \*Ephriam‚Äôs Thoughts\* ‚ÄúBlythe, you‚Äôve grown so much. I wish our father could see you like this. I fear his pride will continue to blind him, which is why I will return home alone. Look how good this life is doing you, you‚Äôve got new partners, made new friends and have grown not only in strength but in wisdom as well. I could never take something so perfect from you. I love you little brother. I will help you find Aiden. Thank you for opening my eyes too.‚Äù Ephriam pondered to himself.",PokemonFanFic,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonFanFic/comments/pdd9gj/pokemon_discord_version_book_2/,,Havocnova,pdd9gj,/r/PokemonFanFic/comments/pdd9gj/pokemon_discord_version_book_2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonFanFic/comments/pdd9gj/pokemon_discord_version_book_2/,0,2021-08-28
Pokemon! Discord Version: Book 2," **By: Damion James Havoc**

**Chapter 1** 

As Warden Liander fled through the brisk night sky, flying upon his pokemon partner Corvinight, he couldn‚Äôt believe what had just taken place. ‚ÄúThis is impossible! How could I have let something like this happen?! Who were those children?! What did they want with that lowlife Pence and his mangey pack of degenerates?! There‚Äôs no doubt that something foul is brewing, some kind of resistance maybe? And the angry spirit that attacked me, there‚Äôs no mistaking it now. That spirit was Prince Adonis Nova, he‚Äôs back and he wants his revenge! I must make it to the Citadel to inform King Xalis. The return of Prince Adonis Nova, The Speed Devil.. In life, he was wickedly powerful but now in death, his power has exhumed his grave. Adonis has become a monster, a true abomination of nature. My dear king, what have you done?‚Äù Liander said as he grew closer to the Team Rocket Citadel Islands. \*Static\* He switched his communicator from map to radio mode and attempted a mayday distress signal. ‚ÄúMayday! This is Warden Liander Gilvette, Senior Admiral. Currently approaching Big Crimson! Requesting immediate consultation with the king! I repeat! Requesting immediate consultation with the king! Big Crimson, please respond.‚Äù He said to his communicator. \*Static\* ‚ÄúThis is Big Crimson to Admiral. Please stand by‚Ä¶. \*Static\* Opening hangar doors now. Admiral, your Corvinight mount is clear for entry.‚Äù replied a voice from his radio signal. Liander guided his Corvinight in through the hangar doors and landed as the doors quickly shut behind them. 

‚ÄúAdmiral, sir!‚Äù A few Citadel Agents stood at attention with formal salutes as Liander unmounted Corvinight. ‚ÄúAt ease men. Corvinight, return to me.‚Äù Liander said as he returned Corvinight to it‚Äôs pokeball. ‚ÄúAdmiral sir, King Xalis will be right with you.‚Äù Said Advisor Damascus Marron as he stepped out from the shadows. ‚ÄúWell now! Senior Scribe Damascus Marron, is that really you? It‚Äôs been ages, how have you been, old friend?‚Äù Liander says to Damascus. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Advisory Head Damascus now my friend, I‚Äôve been well. It seems from the looks of things you cannot say the same, I‚Äôm assuming?‚Äù Damascus replied. Before Liander could say anything, King Xalis interrupted and said, ‚ÄúAdmiral! What is the meaning of this distress signal!?‚Äù Damascus and Liander then walked over to the steel conference circle and were seated after the King had sat down at the head of the table. ‚ÄúMy liege, I apologize for my sudden intrusion. I regret to inform you that my prison tower within Siren City has been destroyed and reduced to rubble. Most of my guard force and prisoners were killed in the exchange. After two rogue agents infiltrated the tower, they attempted to release the remaining Shade operatives from my custody.‚Äù Liander explained. \*Punch!\* ‚ÄúArrggghhhh!‚Äù King Xalis then punched Liander in the face so hard that he flew back at least twenty feet through the palace corridor. While leaving a trail of blood with a few teeth that were almost completely shattered, Liander was dazed for a moment but quickly regained his composure. ‚ÄúMy new arm is working at capacity, wouldn‚Äôt you say Damascus?‚Äù The King said while admiring his arm that he created using the DNA and cellular tissue of Mew, the pokemon of origin. 

The skin was translucent with a violet coloration while the veins and organic tissue would glow fluorescent purple showing grotesquely through the skin. ‚ÄúIt works well now, however we still have a few blood conversion tests to undergo before it will perform at its fullest.‚Äù Damascus replied. ‚ÄúHahaha! Yes. It won‚Äôt be much longer until all of the blood running through my body will be replaced with the blood of Mew!‚Äù King Xalis said as he then focused his attention back on Liander who was trying his best to get back onto his feet. The king walks over to Liander angrily and lifts him up by his throat, squeezing tight with his grotesque modified arm. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre meaning to tell me that one of my most secure facilities in all of Agoria was successfully infiltrated by only two rogue agents!? Who are these impossibly skilled agents who were able to best you and the entirety of your guard force that were on duty!? And what of Silus Pence!? Where is that traitorous dog now!?‚Äù King Xalis exploded with anger as he put Liander down and let him speak. ‚ÄúWell my liege, unfortunately Pence and his operatives managed to escape my grasp. The identity of the two agents are currently unknown but they appeared to be children. One of them had snow white hair and used dragon type pokemon, the other was skilled with projectile blades and explosives, he also used the Eon Spirit Sylveon as his pokemon partner. But that‚Äôs just the thing! It wasn‚Äôt the two rogue agents that destroyed the tower, it was a very angry spirit. My king, I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this without sounding entirely mad. King Xalis, the spirit of Adonis has returned.‚Äù Liander said hyperventilating as the King turned completely white and his expression changed from angry to stunned in seconds.

‚ÄúWhat did you just say to me, Admiral?‚Äù The King replied more calmly this time. ‚ÄúMy liege, there was no mistaking it. I am absolutely certain the spirit that destroyed the tower was Prince Adonis.‚Äù Said Liander desperately. Damascus looked at Liander with pure fear written across his face. ‚ÄúAdmiral, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs impossible. We recovered the Prince‚Äôs remains after the massacre of Sector 66. He and his team were given a most respectable funeral. He was honored as a legendary hero among Team Rocket ranks. Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt one of Pence‚Äôs men that may have only looked similar to Adonis?‚Äù Damascus asked with a shivering fear throughout his words. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand Damascus! The phantom blade Aegislash hung from his back and the markings caused by the contract littered his pale phantom flesh! Before he spared my life he spoke to me, his words were as cold as death and freezing black fire danced around his very essence! I looked into his eyes! Those blood red eyes of death.. It's‚Ä¶ It's an omen.. A bad, bad omen! He truly possessed the eyes of Lord Xiro! \*Flashes back to Anzu Adonis\* Lord Xiro used those eyes to peer into the Distortion World and defeat the Dark Lord Giratina! Do you have any idea what a dark and vengeful spirit could do with that kind of power!? He‚Äôs come back to our world and has become horrendously powerful, my liege! He‚Äôs back and he‚Äôs coming for us all!‚Äù Liander was then quickly cut off by King Xalis slamming his fist down on the table. ‚ÄúEnough! Let me think for a goddamn second! If this is true, then we must take all the proper precautions! Admiral, you will log the descriptions and last known locations of the two child infiltrators into the communicator, don‚Äôt spare any details whatsoever. I want them found and I want them found soon. Gamma Squad will patch you into their frequency and you will give them access to your description files. Damascus, you will dispatch Gamma Squad for an extraction mission immediately. Gamma Squad will secure the children and bring them to me, I have quite a few questions for them.‚Äù Xalis explained. 

‚ÄúSir.‚Äù Damascus said as he made his way to the command center. ‚ÄúAdmiral Liander. I want you to return to Siren City and begin the reconstruction project of the Prison Tower. I will dispatch a group to assist you in a few hours along with a replacement guard force, until then you will clean up your goddamn mess. This is your last chance Liander. If I find out you‚Äôre lying about any of this, you will spend the remainder of your miserable days undergoing dangerous and painful cellular experimentation. Are we clear, Admiral!?"" said Xalis. ‚ÄúY..Yes sir!‚Äù Liander said shakily. ‚ÄúGood, now begone from me and be quick about getting back to your city.‚Äù Xalis said as Liander summoned Corvinight again and began making his way back to Siren City. It seems Gamma Team will now carry out their priority orders which are to extract and detain Aiden and Blythe. The Gamma Team consisted of seven elite Team Rocket members. These elites were trained extensively in stealth and extremely low profile missions. The Gamma Team were known as the ghosts of Team Rocket, while carrying out jobs they usually would be in and out without a trace. They wear full face masks and dark hoods so discovering a member‚Äôs identity is almost impossible. They were always trained to off themselves before compromising the discovery of their true identity. One key thing about this group is that every one of its members dedicates training to primarily ghost type pokemon, as training among ghosts is the way to become the most elusive. \*Sounds of shuffling\* ‚ÄúHuh? What? What‚Äôs going on? Aiden!? Hey! Put him down!‚Äù Blythe yelled as he awoke to Gamma Squad surrounding their camp site.They had used a rag doused in chloroform to keep Aiden unconscious. Then one of the members scooped Aiden up and threw him over his shoulder. Quickly one of the Gamma Squad members grabbed Blythe from behind and shoved the rag in his face. ‚ÄúHyaaaahh!‚Äù Blythe yelled out as he twisted around quickly and pushed the member back and attempted to charge his secrets of nature energy. ‚ÄúWhat!? No!? It‚Äôs still night time!? Damn it!‚Äù He yelled as he failed to charge his energies to try and stop Gamma Squad. 

\*Dash!\* He then bolted into the thick snowy woods using the microscopic amount of energy he had left. \*Swoop\* \*Swoop\* The member of Gamma Squad that had Aiden secured then began to make his way back to the rendezvous point while the other six members and their ghost pokemon focused on Blythe and chased him through the woods. \*Blythe‚Äôs Thoughts\* ‚ÄúShit! Who the hell are these guys?! This isn‚Äôt good! I have to save Aiden! All of our pokemon and gear are still back at the campsite! I need to shake these guys but I‚Äôm almost completely out of energy! Shit! What do I do!?‚Äù Blythe thought to himself as the hooded Gamma Squad cornered him, surrounding Blythe on all sides. ‚ÄúWell come on then! If you want to fight! Then come and get it!‚Äù Blythe yelled as he realized he was out of options. Then one of the duskull shot a shadow ball at Blythe that sounded like a bullet zipping through the air. \*Swoop!\* \*Shing!\* Out of nowhere and to Blythe's surprise, Ephriam dashed in front of the shadow ball using his secrets of nature and blocked the attack, catching it on one of his blades. \*Shiiiiinnnnggg!\* ‚ÄúHyaaaaaaahh!‚Äù Ephriam yelled out as he infused his energy with the shadow ball that he caught and made it bigger, causing it to shine with blinding lights. ‚ÄúLightforce, Sword!‚Äù \*Echoes!\* \*Swish!\* \*Crash!\* He launched the now massive and brightly shining orb back at the Duskull and it‚Äôs trainer, causing them and a few other enemies to burn alive in almost an instant. ‚ÄúEphriam!? Is that you!?‚Äù Blythe said as Ephriam looked back at Blythe and cut his eyes. ‚ÄúWhere are your pokemon partners?‚Äù Ephriam asked. ‚ÄúBack at camp, these guys took my friend and chased me all the way here! I have to help Aiden! He could be in real trouble!‚Äù Blythe replied as he and Ephriam both dodged an oncoming attack. 

\*Swoop!\* The remaining Gamma Squad members went to attack Blythe and Ephriam. ‚ÄúGrrr, here!‚Äù Ephriam said as he tossed Blythe one of his blades and summoned Noivern. As Blythe caught the blade, he quickly side stepped one of the Gamma Squad members and was able to connect his blade with her throat, successfully cutting her down. ‚ÄúWoah! Is that, Noibat!? He‚Äôs huge now!‚Äù Blythe asked, amazed at Noibat‚Äôs intense evolution. Ephriam backflipped over the last two members and landed behind them while simultaneously cutting through their kneecaps, slicing one solid direction then coming back the other direction to cut through their necks, severing both of their heads instantly. The death of their trainers caused the remaining enemy pokemon to disappear and flee from the battle. ‚ÄúHe evolved, Blythe, he‚Äôs Noivern now. You know, evolution. The thing that every living creature does eventually while undergoing growth. That is, every living creature besides you. It seems no matter how many mistakes you make, you never learn your lesson. Why did you run away like this Blythe? You know how much trouble I went through to find you?‚Äù Ephriam said to Blythe as he snatched his blade back from him and sheathed his weapons. ‚ÄúLook Ephriam, I don‚Äôt have time for this! I need to save Aiden. They took him! I need to tell Anzu! Where the hell was Anzu for all that!? Why didn‚Äôt he show up!? What the hell is going on!?‚Äù Blythe said in frustration and worry as he began to run back to camp to retrieve his gear and pokemon. Ephriam mounted Noivern and followed Blythe back to camp. ‚ÄúWait a second Blythe, did you say the name Anzu just then?‚Äù Ephriam asked Blythe. ‚ÄúYea, it‚Äôs kind of a long story. Anzu is this weird spirit that floats around Aiden or something and helps us on our missions. But for some reason he left us high and dry in that last situation and I have no idea why! Now Aiden‚Äôs missing and he doesn‚Äôt even have his pokemon to help him!‚Äù Blythe says as he gathers all of their things and gears up. While doing this he noticed Aiden‚Äôs belt only had two pokeballs on it.

‚ÄúWait, he‚Äôs got Sylveon with him! That‚Äôs good, but still! They knocked him unconscious with some kind of chemical! We have to help him big bro! Please! You‚Äôll help me with this, won‚Äôt you!?‚Äù Blythe pleaded to Ephriam. ‚ÄúSee Blythe, this is what I'm talking about. You mustn't involve yourself with the world outside of our community, and this is the perfect example as to why. Why do you think we have rules set in place for us to follow? There is a reason we must obey our father and our clan, Blythe. We can‚Äôt simply help everyone that needs it, it‚Äôs just not plausible anymore. Don‚Äôt you see Blythe, this world is tarnished by Team Rocket. It‚Äôs too far gone for any of us to save, we need to focus on what‚Äôs important, we need to preserve and appreciate what we have within our clan.‚Äù Ephriam preached. ‚ÄúWow Ephriam, I thought you were better than that. I can‚Äôt believe you would look me in the face and preach to me like our father or one of the other cowardly elders. You know what Ephriam! I think you‚Äôre wrong! I think all of you are wrong! We come from one of the proudest and most powerful clans in existence! Aiden was right, all we do is sit comfortably up in our mountain and hide from danger, while the entire world around us suffers. That kid not only made his way from Hallow Town to try and convince us of an alliance but he did it with an Eevee and a Zubat alone. I battled him in front of our whole clan, I thought I had that battle in the bag but right when I least expected it he came back and wiped the floor with me! Ever since then, we‚Äôve done amazing things, faced impossible odds and have progressed a long long way. But through everything, everything leading up to this very moment, I believe in that kid. I believe in Aiden. And trust me, I‚Äôm not the only one either. That kid‚Äôs gonna change the world one day and I want to be right there beside him when he does it! I haven‚Äôt even known him very long but I‚Äôd die for him if I had to! Because that‚Äôs what it means to have friends! That‚Äôs what it means to have a unit! It means you would lay your life down to protect someone who‚Äôs precious to you! What‚Äôs the point in being strong if you only protect yourself? I believe in sharing my strength, isn‚Äôt that what being a pokemon warrior is all about? You and your pokemon partners, sharing each other's strength to create an even deadlier force.‚Äù Blythe said with touching confidence. 

‚ÄúBlythe... ‚Äú Ephriam said as he listened to Blythe with full attention as the sun slowly began rising. ‚ÄúAll I‚Äôm saying is that there‚Äôs a better path our clan could walk, a path to a brighter future. A brighter future not only for ourselves but for everyone else, people, pokemon and gods alike! Aiden needs our help and I‚Äôm going to help him, with or without you, big bro. And if you think I‚Äôm going back home with you after everything we‚Äôve accomplished on this journey so far, then you‚Äôre even more blind than I thought.‚Äù Blythe said in conclusion. ‚ÄúBlythe, I understand where you‚Äôre coming from little brother, I really do. But I must follow my convictions to death, you know this. It‚Äôs the path I‚Äôve chosen for myself, just as you chose yours. Though I respect this new found conviction in you, I still must insist that you come home with me. It‚Äôs my mission to bring you back and I‚Äôm going to do just that. One way or another.‚Äù Ephriam says as he unsheathes his blades and charges his secrets of nature in the faint sunrise. ‚ÄúHuh? Hmm.. Hahaha!‚Äù Blythe laughs. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so funny?‚Äù Ephriam says while in secrets of nature full cloak state. ‚ÄúI always knew it would come to this, you and me. Blade to blade.‚Äù Blythe says as he unsheathes his high frequency blade and charges his secrets of nature since the sunrise was barely giving off just enough light. ‚ÄúHyaaahhh!‚Äù Blythe yelled as he charged up into secrets of nature gauntlet mode, cloaking his arms and legs in his dense energies. ‚ÄúIf this is what it takes to save my friend, then let‚Äôs do this! Go! Axew! Shelgon!‚Äù Blythe yelled as he summoned Shelgon and Axew to the battle. ‚Äú\*Scoff\* I won‚Äôt even waste my pokemon‚Äôs strength in a battle like this. I can take anything you throw at me by myself. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve seen me at full power have you Blythe? In fact, now that I think about it, I don‚Äôt think you ever will ,little brother. Hya!‚Äù Ephriam said as he attempted to strike Blythe head on with deadly high speeds. 

\*Swoosh!\* \*Catch!\* ‚ÄúShelgon protect!‚Äù Blythe yelled as Ephriam‚Äôs attack was intercepted by Shelgon. ‚ÄúAxew! Dual Chop!‚Äù Axew then leaped from Blythe‚Äôs shoulder toward Ephriam. \*Swoosh!\* Ephriam spun rapidly through the air, successfully blocking Axew‚Äôs dual chop and kicked Axew to the ground. Suddenly as Ephriam looked up, he was face to face with Blythe in mid air. \*Strike!\* Blythe strikes and clashes blade to blade in mid air with Ephriam at high speeds. \*Ching!\* \*Cling!\* As they clash Blythe is standing toe to toe with Ephriam with a display of combat proficiency that is highly impressive to him. ‚ÄúYou certainly have grown since you‚Äôve been away, little brother. It‚Äôs a shame I‚Äôll have to end this battle here and now. Hyaaaaaahh!‚Äù Ephriam said as he charged his secrets of nature even more. Axew and Shelgon are now fainted and Blythe is on his last legs. ‚ÄúI can keep going, this isn‚Äôt over! I'll keep fighting until every bone in my body is broken! Hyaaaaahhh!‚Äù Blythe charges his secrets of nature to the point where he is almost emitting a full cloak. In an instant they both finish charging and fly at each other for one final intense clash. ‚ÄúHyaaaaaah!‚Äù ‚ÄúHyaaahh!‚Äù They yell as they clash and their impact leaves a small crater in the forest floor below them while both Blythe and Ephriam fly back into the opposite direction of each other. Broken trees and charred snow surrounded them as they battled. Ephriam gets up slowly and staggers closer to Blythe. ‚Äú\*Pant\* \*Pant\* Is that‚Ä¶ All you got big bro? I‚Äôm not \*Pant\* \*Pant\* Finished yet..‚Äù Blythe says while laying flat on his back and hyperventilating. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve lost.. \*Pant\* \*Pant\* You‚Äôre coming with me, Blythe.. \*Pant\* \*Pant\*‚Äù Ephriam says as he charges what remains of his energies and goes for Blythe one last time. \*Whip!\* \*Wrap\* \*Wrap\* ‚ÄúWhat the hell!?‚Äù Ephriam yelled out as what appeared to be tree vines that had slithered towards him wrapped his arms and legs individually, bounding him to a tree. He tried charging more energy out of desperation but in his weakened state he could barely move. 

‚ÄúHey little boy! Are you okay!? Did this man hurt you and your little pokemon!? Oh my gosh! Don‚Äôt worry, little white haired boy! I‚Äôm gonna get you out of here!‚Äù Suddenly a whimsical young woman in all black appeared to try and rescue Blythe. ‚ÄúHuh? \*Pant\* \*Pant\* Who are you?‚Äù Blythe asked, completely exhausted. ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Arahbella Augury! My coven lives within this small woodland village. Dissidia is our home and Team Rocket's never gonna change that. That‚Äôs why I protect those like you from Team Rocket scum like this strange man! Don‚Äôt worry little white haired boy! We‚Äôre gonna teach this evil man a lesson about picking on children, isn‚Äôt that right Murkrow!?‚Äù Said Arahbella. ‚ÄúMaaahh! Maah!‚Äù The Murkrow on her shoulder replied positively.  ‚ÄúUmm, my name is Blythe by the way.‚Äù Blythe said. The vines that wrapped Ephraim and bound him to the tree now covered his entire body and face, so he could not speak. Arahbella appeared to be controlling them, as she held her hands out towards the vines to make them move. ‚ÄúWhat? No! That‚Äôs not a member of Team Rocket, it‚Äôs my dumb big brother, Ephriam. We sort of got in a fight, you can let him go.‚Äù Blythe said to Arahbella. ‚ÄúOh! Hah! That explains why he's got snow white hair just like you do! You guys look very similar as well! Haha!‚Äù She giggled nervously and retracted the vines, releasing Ephriam. ‚ÄúThanks for the help though miss, but there‚Äôs someone out there that needs our help even more! My friend Aiden, he‚Äôs younger than me and he‚Äôs been kidnapped! He only has one of his pokemon partners on him and no gear at all! To top that all off Team Rocket are the ones who took him! We need to get him back! Will you help miss!? Please!?‚Äù Blythe explained. ‚ÄúIf someone needs our help then I'm all in! That's what Murkrow and I do after all! Did you see which way the people who took your friend went?‚Äù Arahbella said to Blythe. Ephriam gasped for air behind them as he got onto his feet. ‚ÄúWhat matter of entity are you!? How did you control the vines like that? Are you some kind of forest witch?‚Äù Ephriam asked. ‚ÄúHmm? Oh! You must be F-Ram, right!? F-Ram certainly is a strange name isn‚Äôt it? Hehehe!‚Äù Arahbella asked as she giggled.

‚ÄúMy name is EPHRIAM Lightsworn of the.. I mean.. I..‚Äù Ephriam started to introduce himself but then stopped after realizing that he shouldn‚Äôt tell someone he just met that he was from the Ancient Dragon Clan. ‚ÄúHmm? You remembered your name but forgot your title? What an airhead! Right Blythe? Hehehe!‚Äù Arahbella joked around with Blythe and Ephriam. ‚ÄúHah, yeah he is an air head. Hahaha! But wait! Look, I know we just met but I really do appreciate your help. Before we head out though I need to convince my brother to help too. Ephriam here is one of the best tracking experts our family has to offer! With his help we should be able to find Aiden in no time! Well, what‚Äôs the word, big bro? Did I show you how hard I've been working in my absence?‚Äù Blythe said. ‚Äú..... Fine. I‚Äôll help you. But once we get this kid back I‚Äôm leaving, got it? I‚Äôll go home and tell father you died or something. Happy now Blythe?‚Äù Ephriam said. ‚ÄúHah! Yes! Thank you so much! Big Bro! You won‚Äôt regret this. It‚Äôs decided then! The three of us will team up to get Aiden back from Team Rocket! Yeahh!‚Äù Blythe said with extreme excitement. ‚ÄúLook Blythe, you and I wore each other out pretty badly in that fight of ours. We should rest before we go and take on a highly skilled criminal organization. It would be redundant to confront them in the state we‚Äôre currently in.‚Äù Ephriam said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no time! If we wait any longer they could be way too far gone! We might not make it in time if we wait!‚Äù Blythe said with disappointment. ‚ÄúLook losers! Let me heal you guys!‚Äù Arahbella said. ‚Äú\*Sigh\* Our energy isn‚Äôt normal chi, we use the ancient technique known as the draconid secrets of nature. It would take thousands if not millions of potions to heal us in the state we're currently in. We really wore each other down to nothing in that last battle didn‚Äôt we? Blythe, I meant to tell you this before but, I‚Äôm really proud of you, little brother. You‚Äôre almost fully caught up to me. At your age, that‚Äôs no easy feat. I think you‚Äôve come a long way in a small amount of time, that‚Äôs very impressive, Blythe. I truly mean that.‚Äù Ephriam said. 

‚ÄúBig brother, I've never heard you compliment me before.. \*Clears throat\* Ahem. Thank you. Thank you Ephriam. You really honor me with your words big bro.‚Äù Said Blythe, trying not to get choked up. ‚ÄúUmm, hey dragon dummies. Of course I‚Äôm not going to use potions. You see, I don‚Äôt know if you noticed by now but I‚Äôm using a different type of energy as well. Controlling nature isn‚Äôt the only thing I can do. Here, let me show you!‚Äù Arahbella said as she prepared two blank spell tags. She laid them down on a tree stump and began to focus her energy. \*Rising Winds!\* The winds then blew rapidly and the snow cycloned around Arahbella as she cast her energies into the winds which then carried a bountiful breeze towards the spell tags. Arahbella‚Äôs purple eyes then began glowing brightly. She guided the snowy winds with her arms and the spell tags levitated towards Blythe and Ephriam. ‚ÄúBoth of you, hold out one hand.‚Äù She said as they held their hands out towards the spell tags. The wind picks up even more as the spell tags gently float into each of their palms then disappear into their skin. ‚ÄúWoah! What is this!?‚Äù Blythe yelled out in fear. ‚ÄúShh! It‚Äôs okay Blythe! Just accept the spell tag and it will grant you a permanent capacity boost to your secrets of whatever power! I promise!‚Äù Arahbella said, trying to reassure Blythe. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs really working! Hyaaahhh!‚Äù Ephriam said as he charged his secrets of nature at a much more rapid pace than he ever could before. ‚ÄúWow! For real!? It really works!? Let me try! Hyaaahh!!‚Äù Blythe said as he also charged himself instantly, feeling better than he ever had before in his entire lifetime. The winds then calmed themselves and everything went back to normal. ‚ÄúSee! I told you guys! My coven are transcendental witches! Our practice dates all the way back to ancient times so we're the last of our kind unfortunately. We use natural energy just like you guys!‚Äù Arahbella said with a cute smile. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs incredible. I‚Äôm impressed with this ability of yours. I think we'll make a fine team. Maybe our energy was meant to mesh with others after all.‚Äù Ephriam said. 

‚ÄúYeah! This is completely amazing! Haha! Thank you miss Arahbella! Thank you so much! Haha! Alright! I am fired the hell up now! I feel like nothing can stop us now! Guys, let‚Äôs go rescue Aiden! Team Rocket won‚Äôt stand a chance!‚Äù Blythe said with an intense confidence that he‚Äôs never felt before today. And so this newly formed team made it their goal to rescue Aiden from the clutches of Team Rocket. Ephraim being an expert tracker will no doubt get them on the right road quickly. Though still shrouded with mystery, Arahbella has turned out to be quite the powerful and dependable ally. With a team like this, Blythe has an excellent shot at saving his friend. \*Ephriam‚Äôs Thoughts\* ‚ÄúBlythe, you‚Äôve grown so much. I wish our father could see you like this. I fear his pride will continue to blind him, which is why I will return home alone. Look how good this life is doing you, you‚Äôve got new partners, made new friends and have grown not only in strength but in wisdom as well. I could never take something so perfect from you. I love you little brother. I will help you find Aiden. Thank you for opening my eyes too.‚Äù Ephriam pondered to himself.",PokemonFanWorld,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonFanWorld/comments/pdda02/pokemon_discord_version_book_2/,,Havocnova,pdda02,/r/PokemonFanWorld/comments/pdda02/pokemon_discord_version_book_2/,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonFanWorld/comments/pdda02/pokemon_discord_version_book_2/,0,2021-08-28

29M4F - The Sultans Sodomy Harem,"The sun finally set over the sultanate and the beauty of a full desert moon rose high in the sky. It illuminated faintly the skyline of the now long conquered city and capital of the Umarid sultanate. Towering minarets, domes and plazas litter the city just as numerously as its beggars and merchants, displaying the grandeur and prestige of the sultans now sprawling empire. 


The heart of the empire rests on the land of three rivers, of which centuries earlier those who were the original inhabitants of this land would have viewed the sultans ancestors as simple desert peasants. Conquests and campaigns had brought this rich land under the control of the first Umarid sultan. To the extent now that no one now even begins to question the authority of the Umarid's in this territory; culturally or religiously. At the outskirts of the city, away from the hustle of the markets and the clanging of steel by the tradesmen lies the magnificent palace of Al-Mukhtabi. The palace straddles the central river of the city and is the principal home of Sultan Ali Umarid the first.


The Sultan was young, rather tall, with dark features that were typical of the Umarid dynasty, a dark kept beard, eyes as dark as the night but with a certain glow that reminded one of star or moonlight. He was a built man, strong and usually quick to anger. Traits that either lend themselves to being an excellent general Sultan or a terrible one. His rule however saw successful military campaigns in the north, in the land of the Ihsan, and which showed his strength at leading. Ali however had to be strong and ruthless out of necessity, self-admittedly he often stated that his acquisition of the sultanate was through less honorable means and regretted the way he claimed to power. The lands fell into his hands by the strangling of his brothers one by one in order to maintain his right to the throne, in accordance with the Umarid tradition.


The palace which was won through these cutthroat acts was split into four quarters, one for each wife of Sultan Ali. Each Sultana of the Umarid empire were political marriages, and consequently the sultan had no real interest in these women besides producing heirs or acquiring new territories and alliances. 


Being a military man it was often joked by his subordinates that he only had two desires, conquests and fucking. Viscious rumours circulated about the sultan and his underground harem of women, the sultan apparently only ever sodomised his slave girls in order to guarantee that he would have no offspring from low born slaves. This served two purposes, to keep his dynasty pure of low-born blood, as well as to eliminate potential pretenders that could claim his throne in the future. Some say that many in the harem were forced to also wear chastity belts in order to divert their attention completely away from their vaginas and learn to take pleasure only through the use of their back passage.


But the official state policy of course was that these were merely rumours.


As the sultan sat down for dinner with his men after the sunset prayers to celebrate the victory of his campaign in the north against the Ihsan, the usual discussion of bounties was brought up by the emirs. After hours of negotiations, the sultan agreed that the emirs of Hilal, Dihin and Qataniya were to receive 10% each for their contributions. All that was left was to allocate the human bounty captured from the Ihsan city of Messina. One by one, boys, girls, men and women were lined up and paraded in front of the Sultan and the emirs. The emirs would decide where the slaves would go and ultimately what their fate was as further reparation for their contributions to the war effort.


The strong men and women were usually sent to the agricultural regions of the empire for work in the fields or end up mining the precious ores in the east of the empire. The beautiful women were sent to the capital to work as slaves for the nobility after they were forcefully converted. The sultan did not care for this process and remained quiet and brooding whilst the emirs divided the bounty up between them. 

Hundreds of slaves entered the giant metal doors of the great hall, and all left the exact same way, their heads bowed down low in submission to their new masters as they were led away to their new lives. Not a single slave caught the sultans eye until he saw one young beautiful Ihsannian woman with beautiful skin as pale as milk, with the most alluring and almost seemingly perfect figure to boot.


""This one would do well working as a dance whore in the capital town square, take her away. Next!"" snapped the Emir of Qatiniya, directly next to the Sultan. The guards immediately grabbed her arm and began to take her away.


""Stop."" The sultan let out a roar which stopped the guards in their tracks, with an evil glare towards the Emir. ""Take this one to Al-Mukhtabi.""

Immediately, two burly eunchs lurch forward from their ranks to take you away. You are blindfolded, your hands are tied, and you feel two heavy hands guiding your back with determination. Through the blindfold you get the impression you are ascending a very steep spiral staircase. You feel yourself getting dizzy as door after door is opened and then closed behind you. The random left and right turns building up an anxiety in the pit of your stomach as the neverending trek to some frightening unknown continues. Suddenly and without warning, after what feels like hours, you are forced hard down onto your knees. The hard cold stone floor on your knees grazing you slightly as you fall down to the earth, providing no alleviation to the sense of dread you are currently experiencing.

The blindfold is ripped off and your eyes open, for a second, you are dazed and confused as your eyes adjust to the lighting. 

It is completely obvious to you now that you are in what can only be described as a perverted royal's private quarters.

F4M RP: The Old Man Next Door Takes The Neighborhood Milf,"In your old age you had come to be seen as someone rather harmless, trusting, perhaps even wise. People seemed to trust you, to truly respect you to some degree, especially after wife left you and it had become just you in your household. And while you did enjoy people stopping by to offer assistance if you required any or extra food, they had made you never really needed it. But much more of interest to you of all those people were your neighbors. They were a nice family, but more than that the wife‚Ä¶ she was kind, polite, hardworking but more importantly had the lewdest body you had ever laid eyes on. You couldn‚Äôt believe it the first time you saw her. Large round breasts that could almost always threaten to break a button on her button up collared shirt when she was going out for work, a thick round ass that almost always threatened to tear her pants if she ever bent over and to top it all off she had a nice pretty face with full soft lips that you knew would just feel amazing to kiss, or better yet, kiss your cock. It was nice to be so trusted as the kind old man next door, it helped you get all sorts of looks and glances you probably otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have gotten. Almost daily did she tease you with her mere existence. It had become almost routine for you to be up early on your porch not just to enjoy the morning air and sunrise but to witness her morning jogs. Her hair pulled back in a tight ponytail as she pranced around in her sports tank top and yoga pants. The way her body swayed and jiggled was almost always too much to bear. After politely returning her good morning greeting you would watch her jog away, thick cheeks clapping as the seam of her pants rode up her crack. You would sit there fantasizing until she went out of view before returning to your home and jerking off vigorously from the memory.  
  
Eventually though, it wasn‚Äôt enough to just have your thoughts and fantasies about that incredibly Milf. You needed more and by God you were going to get more if you could. So began a meticulous habit of snapping pictures and videos when you could, always out of view or while she was distracted. The mornings were easy to get material from. With her distracted with her morning workout routine, you could easily snap pictures when she turned her back or her focus on exerting her own body. You easily had time to zoom and take all the shots you wanted off her ass as she bent over for a stretch, her breasts bouncing and swaying back and forth with each movement, sweat even dampening her clothing as she rounded back down the road on the sidewalk, occasionally even she must have hurried and not put a bra on as you could make out the impression of her large nipples pressing against the fabric of her clothing. Over a few days you got some amazing fap material, but you knew you needed more, and you could get it. Kindly and politely, you invited the couple to your house for dinner and a swim in your pool. Of course, they accepted your offer and you felt so pleased with yourself because you would be able to see her in a bathing suit. They arrived on that day in the evening close to sundown. Partially disappointed she a loose-fitting dress of sorts on over her swimwear but it only made you hungrier for a true look at her body underneath. Time continued as you bated your time and waited for attention to be off you. Everyone sat down on your backyard patio. Idle chit-chatted was carried on as you acted as your normal kindly self, asking about work and family, wishing them all the best but it was in that conversation that you picked up a piece of information that made your ears perk up. Her husband mentioned that he had to leave for a business trip soon. Which would leave his wife home all alone by herself. While your mind hadn‚Äôt come up with an active plan yet you knew that it would be an opportunity to at the very least get so much more than you ever could have before.  
  
After that coasting conversation you stood up and said that the cooking should begin soon. Her husband was quick to offer that he be the one that cook the food on the grill, since you were so kind to invite them over for such a friendly get together. At that she stood up as well saying that she would enjoy the pool for a tiny bit. As you looked down at her, eyeing her clear cleavage she held her phone in her hands, checking it and somehow you were able to notice her passcode as she entered it quickly before she laid it down on the table. Your heart began to race as she said that she would take a dip and knew that now you could sneak some more material for your ever-growing collection of fap material of her. You moved hurriedly yet restrained into the house to get the foods for the grill and by the time you returned it took every ounce of will power to not immediately get noticeably hard at the sight in front of you. She had finally disrobed from her dress and now completely in her swimwear. Her bikini was something that belonged in some porno. Her top was so conservative with its material that it only just barely covered her nipples, in fact when she moved or turned you could start to see her areola‚Äôs peeking out from behind her top, and none of her breast size or form was left to the imagination. The bottoms for it weren‚Äôt anything worse either, small and seemed to only serve the purpose of just covering her holes, the thin fabric looped down just over her pussy and when she turned around you saw that her large ass had completely swallowed it, revealing it all in its glory. Your frustration mounted as you grew excited. It was no doubt for her husband as she probably didn‚Äôt consider you looking at her but you couldn‚Äôt help but feel like she was such a tease with her erotic body that belonged in some porn video online or modeling magazine. You couldn‚Äôt help but feel like such a lewd body was wasted on her husband entirely. You bit your lip as her husband took the food from you and turned away to begin his task and you reached for your phone and waited when she was no longer paying attention to you. You were able to get some good pictures from the ordeal of trying to play everything cool. Sadly, and to your dismay however her husband kept trying to strike up conversation with you as he went back and forth. And you missed a shot that would have become your trophy of all you had. When the food was nearly done, she had taken noticed and began to make her way to the ladder on the side of the pool and then began to climb out. Her back to you and her husband turned away you weren‚Äôt fast enough to capture it but you saw it completely and burned it into your brain. As she lifted her legs, arching her body forward as she climbed out of the water her cheeks spread from the motion and so clearly you were able to see as the fabric of her swimsuit, so thin in the back just barely covered her holes. The outline of her cute butthole peeked out from around it and the bottom rode up on her pushing against her pussy into an obvious impression and camel toe of it. It left almost nothing to the imagination but just hid enough to make you feel wild. The rest of the night you were almost in a daze trying your best to keep up appearances and not just tell them to leave so you could walk inside and jerk off. Finally‚Ä¶ the day completely closed, she redressed, and they both left, leaving lots of leftovers.  
  
You were furious as you tried to get off thinking back on the moments of the night. How dare she be so erotic and taunting. She needed a good fucking; her body was made for sex and cock. You thought hard about it and just as you were about to finish a thought leapt into your mind, piecing together all the things you‚Äôve experienced that night. She would be all alone for a week soon. You knew how to get into her phone too and‚Ä¶ you needed a new wife. You came hard as the thought planted itself into your head and a devious plan started to form.  
  
You had marked the date in your calendar and waited for what felt like an eternity despite it only being a few days. You watched out your window as that lewd Milf‚Äôs husband had left. Now was time to get your plan into motion. Today you didn‚Äôt sit outside in the morning to watch your neighbor‚Äôs morning job instead you sat in the window and sorted out the details in your mind. You waited painfully all day, keeping yourself on edge until you watched her return from work. At that point you exited your house and waved in a loud greeting to get her attention. ‚ÄúHey! I just remembered your husband was leaving for awhile.‚Äù You lied through your teeth. ‚ÄúI still have extra leftovers and I was thinking that since you‚Äôre so tired from work I‚Äôd offer you to eat at my place for tonight to help lighten the load before you head off to bed. Easier than cooking something right?‚Äù She locked her car and thought hard for a moment before gazing at you. She sized you up and then nodded with a smile. ‚ÄúThank you so much.‚Äù She said kindly. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll take you up on that offer if I‚Äôm not imposing.‚Äù She returned her kind smile and then led her back to your front door. She underestimated you, she couldn‚Äôt comprehend your intentions, always thinking you to be the kindly old man next door. She would be proven wrong tonight. You, like a true kind old man allowed her in the door first then walked in after her smiling to yourself as you locked the door behind you.  
  
You acted as if nothing was wrong or weird, just as you always would but kept your goal at the forefront of your mind reheating food and subtly offering her a glass of wine. ‚ÄúNothing like a good glass of red to end the day.‚Äù You explained keeping up the fa√ßade. Feeling as though it would be rude to do otherwise she accepted as you chatted back and forth. One glass, two glass, three glasses in and a long day of work behind her you noticed how sleepy faced she seemed to get. Multiple times after she tried to excuse herself and yet you always were able to cut off that approach eventually leading her to the living room to continue your ‚Äúconversation‚Äù. You kept switching topics never really letting her get a word in until as you continued to talk you noticed that her eyes had closed and she was fast asleep, no doubt having been exhausted and relaxed. A devious smile crept on your face as you began to set up your work. A camera facing her, scissors in hand you approached her carefully, pinching the fabric on her nipples and pulling her on it before snipping it off. Her shirt ruined but you completely opened up her nipples to your gaze. You lick your lips already tempted to suck and play and tease with them but you hold off until all preparations were complete. Carefully you laid her onto the couch, her body near limp as you pull up her skirt and expose her pantyhose, a clear thong hugging her hips underneath. What a slutty bitch you thought as you cut it up and then snipped the fabric of the thong. Finally her bare ass was completely open and available to you. You couldn‚Äôt help yourself as your hands gripped and squeezed her cheeks, your fingers sinking into the thick flesh as your thumbs spread them wide and a quiet groan came from her. There before your very eyes was her holes. Her cute little butthole twitching and squeezing subconsciously from your teasing and her pussy near quivering under your hands. Pursing your lips you let down a glop of spit onto her asshole, your thumb carefully moving in to rub it in and down over he pussy. This was it; this was your moment.  
  
You adjusted yourself on the couch, your long thick cock and heavy balls throbbing just above her ass. You had been anticipating this moment for so long. You pressed your thumb against her small hole, pushing against it until the muscles gave way. At that moment, the moment your thumb sunk into her butthole her upper body shot up as she moaned loudly and so lewdly. It was then that you pounced. You jumped forward pinning her down as your thumb sunk all the way into her ass and gripped her face with your other hand covering her open mouth as she moaned. ‚ÄúFinally awake?‚Äù You asked coyly as you began to pump your finger in and out of her hole. Just such a simple act reaffirmed your desire and mindset that she was the perfect woman as she moaned repeatedly against your hand. Her own hands reached up and grasped yours on her face but almost as if grabbing a cat by their tail she seemed helpless, like a deer in headlights. The sounds she made against your hand told you that she was trying to make sense of the situation, to question what you were doing. There was no need to even ask as you planned to express everything to her in the end. Your cock throbbed and prodded against her ass, teasing her with what you were about to do. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been watching you for some time.‚Äù You said slowly removing your thumb from her tight hole and reaching forward to grab one of her arms and pin it behind her back. You thick and long cock pressed downward as you replaced the pressure on her hole with the tip of your dick, pushing and teasing her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been teasing me for so long with such an erotic body and I‚Äôve decided to make you apologize to my dick for tormenting it so much.‚Äù The moment you said that last word you pushed your hips down sinking your cock deep into her hole. You felt her tongue press against your hand as her eyes rolled back from the simple act of making her take your cock. You groaned heavy unable to stop yourself as you began to thrust harder and harder, your heavy balls clapping against her ass. You felt her muscles squeeze and milk your cock as you pushed it down to the base and pulled out to just the tip and repeated the process. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to punish you thoroughly!‚Äù  
  
Only a short time later you pinned her to the floor, your body mounting and encircling hers as you restrained her in a tight mating press, not letting her move or get away. Your hips piston thrust with more life than you had felt in years while your mouth latched on and sucked hard on her large nipples, pulling and stretching them as you roughly teased them. ‚ÄúOOoh Pleassee Ahh St-TOP AHH!‚Äù She begged, moaning at the depth of each of your thrusts but her pussy was squeezing and clamping down on your raging member while your first load oozed from her. The camera you had set up captured it all, every detail of her large round ass pinned to the floor, her pussy completely stretched by your thick and long cock as you pulled to the tip and thrust all the way back in rapidly showing just how much she was taking. Her face was distorted so lewdly as her mouth was gaped, tongue lulling out and her eyes rolled back. Her voice was loud with moans and pleas. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided to make you my new wife!‚Äù You groaned as you slammed down hard against her ass, clapping her cheeks with your balls. ‚ÄúNhOooo!‚Äù She cried out in a moan. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm maaArrried!‚Äù You tsked with authority. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no good, if you keep acting like that I‚Äôll have to train you properly until you become my cockwife!‚Äù And with that declaration you slammed your hips down, pushing as deep into her womb as you could and unloaded yet another thick and gooey warm load. She moaned loud and hoarse again.  
  
Unrelenting, after that you had pulled her into your bedroom. You pushed her forward, hands bound behind her back while your fingers hooked her cheeks and played with her tongue keeping her from talking back to you. You kept her steps in pace with yours which kept her body pressed against you, your still throbbing cock mashed tightly between her thick ass cheeks so that with each step she stroked your dick and rubbed all your excess cum over it ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be my bitch from now on and that pesky husband of yours won‚Äôt get in my way. I‚Äôm going to break you and make you mine by the time he comes back.‚Äù You introduced her to her new bed with a camera already set up in the room. You had ripped off and discarded the rest of her clothing now. She was completely naked and you used the scraps of her slutty underwear to bind her hands by her wrists behind her back. You laid comfortably on the bed, made her crouch on her knees between her legs with her back arched and her thick ass pointed out towards the camera you set up. Both of her holes oozed your spunk. One of your hands rested on her head making sure she properly sucked your cock with deep long strokes, while the other went through her phone, replying to a goodnight message from her husband to avoid any sort of suspicion, then you switched to the camera and pointed it down at her slutty face. Her soft round lips pursed around your shaft, tears and spit coating her face and smearing her makeup from the effort of taking it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry I won‚Äôt send anything to your husband right now if you do a good job. But we can give him all the footage I‚Äôll have of you submitting to me when you leave him, Oh and don‚Äôt worry about your clothes, you‚Äôll be staying here from now on, so you won‚Äôt need them‚Äù She groaned in response, probably some sort of protest but all it served to do was make her tongue vibrate on the underside of your cock. ‚ÄúI hope you enjoyed that last meal because I‚Äôll be changing you to a strict new diet. I read online somewhere that the more cum you put into a woman the more submissive and obedient she becomes."" You smile with another deep groan as you pushed her head down, making her kiss the base of your cock and pumped rope after rope of thick spunk into her throat, clearly more than she could handle as she coughed, her cheeks starting to bulge while her eyes rolled back as some of your cum began to ooze from her nostrils and around her lips. You sighed loudly in relief, holding down her head to make sure she took every drop of your sperm. ‚ÄúYour body was made for my cock, and I won‚Äôt stop until I‚Äôve made you my exclusive wife and cumdump. Now hurry up and swallow all of it, your slutty face makes me want to cum all over it. You‚Äôre going to use that mouth on your new husband‚Äôs balls next and I want a picture of my cock on your face to commemorate the start of your submission to me.‚Äù  
  
// Wow that‚Äôs a long one! This is a slight departure from what I normally write, but this is something I have been thinking about for a long time, so I sort of just put it all out there! I perfer this to be long term and I‚Äôm open to further discussion and alteration about the setup of course! I prefer to RP in first person, and I don't use kik or any other means to rp just reddit messages. Kinks: Kinks: anal, ahegao, oil, rough sex, netorare, messy sex, sloppy, bondage, throat fucking, mating press, humiliation, being dominated, cheating, and I‚Äôm open to the implication of impregnation, but I don‚Äôt really want to play out a pregnancy, ya know?

    * I love goldens because they're so sweet and gentle and love hiking and swimming usually.

"[F4GM] Samurai Takes Down Cocky Men (Violence, Darkness)","Blood, yet again, meets my blade. I accidentally sheathed it when I was done with my little exercise earlier, so that‚Äôs gonna be a bitch to clean out. Well, at least I have something to do today. Normally, I just::.wander. 

Course, no one wanders without reason. My reason, like some, I guess, is because my home was destroyed, leaving my whole livelihood with it. Aya Mikawa is the name, and where I am from, that name used to have a small amount of meaning. I was born into the Madamo Swordsmanship Sect, masters of channeling Ki in our blades. And, just my luck, I was born with a shit ton of ki. Turned my hair green as I got older. Back then, I actually kind of gave a shit about my appearance, said hair was usually tied back, and while my eyes were still burning, it was with passion at the time, not with whatever is now. Binding my large chest was also a bit of a priority, as I, if you can believe it, was actually kind of modest. But that shit changed pretty quick. Way too quick indeed. When I was twenty, so this was seven years ago already, I was chosen to be the next master of the Sect, due to my natural abilities and the fact I was a master at that ripe, young age. I left to get the document needed to become the heir, as all Sects are regulated, and when I came back‚Ä¶everyone was but a pile of corpses. I stepped on someone‚Äôs eye when I came in. I could never figure out who‚Äôs head it belonged to. I realized the men were the lucky ones, cause whoever did it had a thing for the ladies. They were pretty‚Ä¶leaky, you could say. Probably because they were filled to the brim. And so, with that, I left to wander. I never figured out who committed the massacre, but every time I think about it‚Ä¶it pisses me off. 

And I guess I was too busy with introspection to only narrowly dodge and arrow coming at me. 

‚ÄúHrm?‚Äù I looked over to where it landed, noticing a group of bandits had formed around me. 

‚ÄúWe normally have a toll, but‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou have another way of payment for girls like me?‚Äù I asked, looking around. It‚Äôs mostly the boobs, fuck modesty at this point. 

‚ÄúThis happens a lot, eh? Do you take the option a lot?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs just that you people can‚Äôt be original.‚Äù 

‚ÄúEh? Feisty‚Ä¶I mean, those are pretty fun to have around.‚Äù 

He motioned for some of his crew, and they came closer. I guess they‚Äôre pretty excited, having a potential chance to have someone else jerk then off rather then themselves. But sadly for them‚Ä¶cutting down cocky men turns me on. The first two don‚Äôt even notice when my Ki channels out below them, suddenly moving away for them to trip. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll kill you guys, but‚Ä¶let me have my fun, yeah?‚Äù I smirked, feeling a bit merciful as I went over to stomp one of the bandit's neck. I heard a crack and a small yelp, and then‚Ä¶wetness. 

He got blood on my foot. Somehow, he coughed blood from that. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù I leaned over at his pained face, slamming my foot down on it. ‚ÄúBetter clean that up. It‚Äôs your mess.‚Äù 

Instinct acts up again as I grab my sword, staring over at a poor little man who got his leg stabbed. ‚ÄúAh. Well, I gotta admit, you do have initiative.‚Äù 

I noticed whoever was shooting arrows hadn't done anything. Perhaps they were busy? But it was a time to take out the leader. I hopped over, tearing off his robe and putting my blade up to his neck, pushing my boobs up into his back.  

‚ÄúHuh? I guess I can see why you have to resort to this‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, feeling his small little member, pulling on the skin below. 

‚ÄúPlease stop‚Ä¶‚Äù He said, weakly. I almost didn‚Äôt hear it. And then‚Ä¶he came all over my hand. I looked down, before I snickered a little, turning around before it was an outright laugh. 

‚ÄúAll right. I had my fun. See ya around.‚Äù I said, waving them off before I left. Off to wander more, I guess.

‚Äî‚Äî-

Hello! I am Mel, nice to meet you today! I am here to look for someone to help me write out my violent power fantasies, with a cool samurai lady! Well, cool in my head anyway.

A little about myself, as I said, I am Mel, I am a gender fluid person who has been writing for six years roleplaying for two. I am an extremely creative person, I feel, and can make characters and worlds with relative ease. I hope you will find I have some writing talent!

I wish to reiterate, this is a power fantasy, I do not wish to sub at all. Please keep that in mind. 

Also, I didn‚Äôt want to go into graphic detail for the prompt, but I can get much more violent in the writing itself,

As for the lewd, my only limits are scat and sounding, so bring anything you like to the table! My personal kinks involve oral, anal, cum, titjobs, big tits, public, confidence to submission, impreg risk, rough sex, and much, much more!

I prefer to roleplay over on discord, as it‚Äôs just easier to manage. 

Message if interested!

"[M4F]Various Prompts: Noisy Neighbor, Blackmailed Secretary, The Warlord, and a few Pro Wrestling themed ones nsfw nsfw","oisy Neighbor: This scenario you are either an 18 year old still living with her parents, or you are my neighbor living with your boyfriend/husband. You see me in passing in the hallways of the apartment complex sometimes, and we're always polite, but never talk much. You S.O/Parents like me well enough, they even trusted me enough to give me a key to your unit to feed your cat while ya'll went on a vacation. But while your parents/S.O go to sleep early at night, you stay up late, and wait until you hear the footsteps of me in the hallway to come home. Because you love hearing the noises that come from the other side of the wall when I bring someone home with me. The sounds of me pounding these women, treating them like sluts, the dirty talk you hear as you press your ear against the wall makes you blush...but also makes you wet. You've stayed up at night touching yourself imagining yourself as the women on the other side of the wall screaming in ecstasy. One evening, when everyone is asleep, you hear me come home, but this time just 1 set of footsteps. I'm alone, and you quietly sneak out, and knock on my door.  
Highlights of this one is the cheating, either on your live in boyfriend/husband if you choose the older option, or just your regular boyfriend if you wanna go younger. I like the idea of maybe making your husband/parents listen to you getting fucked and not even know it's you.  
Blackmailed Secretary: Starting out as an intern at a multinational corporation didn't pay as much as you hoped. Up to your eyeballs in student loans, you thought you'd get a manager position right away, but found yourself doing admin work, hoping to prove yourself to move up in the compnay. Living in the big city was expensive, so you did what every sexy modern girl does in need of extra money. You made an Onlyfans. You were such a small fry in the ocean of ethots, that you never thought anyone in your personal life would ever find it. But one of your managers found it. Your manager also knows just how religious and conservative your family is, and how you'd be disowned entirely if they found out that their precious little girl is whoring herself online to strange men. Now you find yourself having to do whatever he says, your entire wardrobe has changed to please him. Ambitions of becoming an executive cut down, and now the only thing you're in charge of is preparing his coffee, and waiting for him on your knees under his desk for his daily 9 am blowjob.  
Highlights of this one is the power dynamic. Whatever I say goes, and I have been slowly eroding your will over time, once a proud pant suit wearing corporate woman, now a push up bra, cleavage exposed, mini skirt and lacy black stockings wearing secretary, who HAS to do what I say or everyone that she loves will know her dirty secret. You can play this sad and reluctant, or starting to like it.  
The Warlord: You were the Princess/Queen of a small island nation. Your geographic location made it difficult for any army to come through, so an established defense force was never a top priority for your people. That proved to be your undoing, as the seafaring marauders invaded at the dead of night. Raping and pillaging as they made their way to the castle. The guards tried but they fell. When they finally reached the throne room, you saw the face of the man that lead this endeavor. Hulking in size, beard full, long dreadlocked hair. The King tried to duel him, hoping by killing the leader, they'd leave, by the king was no match for him. But the Warlord saw you, and ordered you to be tied up. Later that night, you hear the drums playing, the laughter from the men, and screams from the women, as the marauders delight in their plunder. You are thrown down at the feet of the warlord. You look and see your father/husband the King tied up, gagged and helpless to watch as the warlord rips your gown off of you. To make the King know just how badly he has failed, he's going to take what's most precious of his, right in front of him, and the rest of the captive royal court.  
Highlights of this one is taking the prize, and cucking the King. This one is definitely on the noncon side of things, but I love the image of taking royalty in front of her dad/husband while she begs him to help/save her, and eventually turning on him saying it's all his fault, and then your body betrays you, cumming for the warlord, and you find yourself giving into lust and begging for more of his cock.  
Wrestling Themed Prompts: If you know nothing about Pro-Wrestling, it's probably best if you don't try to attempt these  
The Champ and the Diva: When you got into the wrestling business, you wanted to be that sex object that arena of men were clamoring for. But the #womensrevolution happened, bra and panty matches are a thing of the past, and now the women talent in the company are actually expected to wrestle instead of being eye candy. You were never much a ring competitor, and feel your position in the company being threatened. Desperate to find a gimmick that'll keep you employed you realize that the current champion is single, and attaching yourself to him would secure your spot, put in you the main events by proximity, and make you the envy of every woman, as well as making every man jealous. So you hatch a scheme to seduce him.  
The Valet: Your services as a Valet and manager are highly sought after. Every wrestler you've worked with has gone on to get gold. You have a certain way of keeping your clients motivated, and you aren't above using your body to distract opponents/referees to give your client an edge. You currently find yourself without a client, and heaps of men are vying for your attention. So you decide, you're going to make them prove themselves to be worthy for you. A good ol fashioned 15 man royal rumble. Last man standing gets your services. As the last man get's thrown over the top rope, you see the man who has won, and he looks at you hungrily eyeing his prize. Backstage in the locker room, you show him what he has earned.  
Heel Turn: You've been with Johnny forever, started down the wrestling path together, you two are known all over the country as couple. Johnny eventually found himself a tag team partner, and you found yourself as a makeshift family of 3. Everything was good for a while, but Johnny's tag partner was getting better in the ring and becoming more skilled, while Johnny was lagging behind, and costing them matches. After losing a tag team title match, Johnny's partner snapped, and beat Johnny unconscious with a chair. While at home nursing Johnny back to health, you watches his partner rise up the card as a single competitor. You also found your self more and more attracted to him, while finding yourself only giving pity/duty sex to Johnny in his weakened state. Johnny rehabbed and was training for his revenge match against his ex-partner, but you had zero faith that he'd be able to win the match. Realizing that your career was also being dragged down by Johnny's failure, you decided it was time to jump ship. During their revenge match, you low blow johnny, and cheer on his ex partner as he gives him another beat down and sends him to the hospital. As johnny lays on the ground bleeding, you throw your arms around the man who just beat up your ex, his boot on his chest in triumph, and kiss him passionately in front of the whole crowd to a chorus of boo's. But you don't care, you got yourself a real man now, and the celebration has just begun.  
Pro wrestling is wild, and we can really take these story's wherever we want. Wrestling has literally had a live sex celebration in the ring, so we can do our own take on that. Cameras are everywhere backstage, so we can play it off like the whole crowd and people at home are watching what's going on backstage.  
If any of these ideas appeal to you hit me up with a message or on Reddit chat. If you wanna change up the details lemme know. I work a day job and I'm constantly out in the field, so messaging during the day will be erratic at best. Also I live in the US Central Time zone, so keep that in mind if you are in a different part of the country/planet.

28 [M4M] Buddies into free/casually using my wife when they need to get off?,"This is one of my favourite fantasies/ideas and wondering how many other people like it. Essentially it's simple fantasy of my buddies freely using my wife whenever they want/need. Maybe it's an agreement we all made that when we got girls we'd be good buddies and share. Or maybe I'm just the sharing is caring type and so is my wife! Either way this has been going on long enough that it's all just casual/normal between all of us.

No one blinked an eye when on our wedding night we were joined by my good buddies. Or when my wife and I wake up to one you using her to help relieve your morning wood before heading to work. Or when you need to destress after work stop on by for a quickie. Or come on over, we'll stroke on the couch watching porn until my wife gets home and she helps both off. Or when we all go out together to a bar taking turns taking her to the bathroom or the alleyway. When we‚Äôre at the alter for our wedding while shes giving her vows you‚Äôre underneath her dress and when she‚Äôs saying I do you‚Äôre balls deep in her. More ideas welcome of course! haha

[EVENT] The Dawn of Embers,"Its a quiet night, and as the bus rolled in for its last stop, the man quickly departed and rushed home. As he passed through the ramshackle slums that made up his neighborhood, he quickly found himself on the outskirts of a small crowd. Listening fully slightly to a radio, they waited in anticipation as the final elector ballots were revealed. As the news casters officially stated that no further faithless electors could turn the election away from Wallace and force it into a House election, the assembled crowd cheered with glee, a few whistles piercing the dark night. 

With joy in their hearts, they returned back to their homes as a new day for America seemed to be on the horizon. But while the darkest night always gives way to light, the darkness still needs to be contended. But while as the crowd sleep, other actors came into play. Angry that they failed to keep Wallace out of office, white Southerners would begin to turn out in droves. And it wouldn't take look for their plans and organization to manifest itself into violence. Since the election, a small but noticeable uptick in racial violence would have taken place across the country, but now that Wallace was only weeks away from the highest office in the land? That small but noticeable uptick began to turn into a raging fire. 

While the worst offenses have yet to come to light in the national media, one story that made headlines in across the country, would be the murder of Demarcus Ross and his family in their car. While at a stop-sign in the outskirts of Selma, Alabama, Demarcus would approached by an unknown figure. Quickly getting into an argument with the figure, Demarcus and his family were fatally shot before the gunman fled the scene. While the Selma Police Department has said they would investigate the incident, the story attracted headlines due to its occurrence around noon on Sunday and the seeming inability to find a suitable suspect.",ColdWarPowers,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/pdjbfa/event_the_dawn_of_embers/,EVENT,PanzerBirb,pdjbfa,/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/pdjbfa/event_the_dawn_of_embers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/pdjbfa/event_the_dawn_of_embers/,0,2021-08-28

"34-M-UK looking for a new chat buddy, apply within!","Greetings to you and you,

Thank you for stopping by on my post it‚Äôs almost certainly won‚Äôt be the best one you‚Äôll read but I appreciate you stopping by none the less.

The lockdown has been going on far too long now and it‚Äôs made seeing the circle of friends I did have extremely difficult so here I am browsing the dark subs of Reddit looking to make some new acquaintances. A little bit about me, i hear you ask? Well I‚Äôm like the average person on here liking music and films amongst a few other things (I‚Äôd list them but I‚Äôve just got stage freight! Oh no!) oh i remembered something! I enjoy photography and snapping away at everything I see, maybe one day I‚Äôll get that perfect photo. Although i can‚Äôt remember much, that just means more things to speak about right? I did forget to mention I‚Äôm from the Greatest of Britain‚Äôs.

I‚Äôd like to speak to someone of the opposite gender from either Europe or America (Canada at a push). It would be cool if you‚Äôre down if you could speak a few times a day but I know life gets in the way but working from home the majority of the time, it would definitely help pass the time. 

Sinace it seems to be a deal breaker with a few I thought I‚Äôd mention I‚Äôm in a relationship, with the whole lockdowns and working from home the loneliness is definitely starting to show...

And to finish my post I‚Äôll leave a quote by one of the greatest motivational speakers of all time - ‚Äúyou miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take‚Äù - Michael Scott.

26 M4F daddy/baby,"Its late at night and dads on the couch.. his daughter was always shy and never even kissed a boy yet, however she was always close and comfortable with dad.. she always felt awkward and left out that she hasnt experienced and orgasm.. or sex like her friends from school.. maybe one night she decides to sit close to him and start asking some questions, questions turn to answers, answers turn to actions and teaching... its so wrong but they both love it, do you think shed be comfortable and feel more loved than ever?




Looking for a like minded girl to talk to about this dirty kinky fantasy. About a consensual sexual relationship between a father and his daughter. Nothing turns me on more and id love to talk in detail with you about all the dirty kinky fantasies surrounding it. I want us to really connect on this level and escape into a world of dirty taboo pleasure with you. Maybe we can spark a relationship where we really do care for each other like a daddy and his daughter would and show it to each other through sex and affection? Maybe she likes to sneak into the shower with him late at night..? I love secrets, and i love dirty things that you shouldn't do but you can't help but do it anyway.. lets just have so much fun with this. A father and her his ""adult"" daughter having kinky secret fun together is something i wish i can do one day. Lets live it out

I love the idea of grooming, or the girl becoming curious and going to her dad to ask about sex and maybe they learn together when no ones home.. perhaps it continues every single day? Id also love to hear personal experiences if you have them. Im not sp much looking for a roleplay fling (unless we really connect) im looking for i guess a steady partner to talk about this in deep detail with and maybe live out the fantasy in some way. Im looking for a real dirty connection involving this ;) 

If this interested you at all please send me a detailed message explaining why and tell me a little about yourself and i will do the same. I look foward to hearing from you and having long talks with you every night. This is something you really cant talk to everyone with, so im hoping we really connect with this

Twink, femboy, sissy, transgender, dickgirl...however you identify, I'm looking to play with you today. It might be a bit of a stereotype, but there's nothing better than wedging between a pair of thick white cheeks and stretching out a tight pink boipussy with a fat black cock, and I want to make our dreams come true.

After all, what's better than a dolled-up sissy slinking down to their knees in front of a towering dark-skinned stud? Or a phat-assed twink teasing his older, married neighbor? Or a femboy gamer who's stream gets much more lewd after the sun goes down? Not much. I want to bend you over and stretch you out, filling your slutty holes with my thick, dark meat until your legs are shaking and your head is spinning, so drunk off my delicious chocolate cock that you can barely remember your own name.

I'm looking to exchange 2-3 detailed paragraphs per response with a verbose partner who is fluent in English, and your first message should reflect those qualities. If you're unsure of what your first message should be, you can send me an introduction for your character and/or a sample of a possible scene, but either way I'd like to chat a bit before we actually begin writing together. I've got a few scenes in mind, but I'd also love to hear your own:

* [Neighbor]: I'm your older, divorced neighbor and you're the college-aged twink who lives next door whose parents have left him home alone all summer. I've been eyeing your plump white ass as you spend your days tanning and drinking by the pool, and it won't be long before I finally introduce myself.

* [Stripper]: Are sissy strip clubs a thing? If not, they are now, and you're one of the hottest dancers there. I might be the owner, or maybe just an enamored guest, but either way I'm looking to give you much more than just a tip ;)

* [Streamer] You're an up-and-coming Twitch streamer who's becoming more and more popular. Not only are you a good gamer, but you show plenty of skin and don't hesitate to flirt with you fans. Tonight however, you have a big surprise. There's going to be a guest on your stream tonight and while you won't be gaming, there will be plenty of joystick action

* [Sugar Baby] You moved to Hollywood with dreams of becoming a famous actress, but unfortunately a pretty face isn't enough to make it. Thankfully though there's an overwhelming amount of rich, older men in this city. Surely one of them has connections, or at least a fat wallet and will be willing to help you out in exchange for some services?

* [Rap Star] I'm a young hip-hop artist currently at the top of his game with several hits on the Billboard Hot 100. After a concert, I head backstage to meet some fans, which is always exciting because I never know what to expect. Are you a phat-assed twink who stole someone else's backstage pass? Or maybe you're even a fellow artist that wants to 'collaborate'

---

Hopefully one of those scenes stood out to you and if not, hopefully it got your gears turning for a different idea. Before I go, I'll leave you with a mostly (but not completely) exhaustive list of my kinks and limits.

Kinks: cock/BBC worship, huge/massive/hyper cocks, powerbottoms, age gap, size difference, interracial/raceplay, slurs, degradation, hair-pulling, spanking, slapping, anal, rimming (especially receiving), a2m, messy sex, sloppy blowjobs, deepthroat, throatfucking, bimbos, MILFs, sexy/slutty outfits, high heels, nails, bimbofication, sissification, semi-public sex, light bondage, cheating/cuckolding, dp, gangbangs, groupsex, harems, BNWO, cum

Limits: bathroom, blood/gore, non-con, beast, vore, underage, bottoming, feminization (you should already be femme), bad grammar, effortless writing, realplay (this post is for our fantasies, I'm really not that interested in what you look like or do IRL)

[M4A] The Avatar of Incest Just Moved Into Your Neighborhood,"The ugly home at the center of the neighborhood had finally sold. Finally, the eyesore would be torn down and replaced with something lavish. But when a voluptuous woman in a flowing white dress arrived, the community was shocked to see her simply move in. No wealthy husband followed. No grating sounds of construction in the mornings.
  

  
Alone, the stranger tended her barren garden. When she wasn't outside she could often be heard within, singing amidst her decaying little home. Disbelief turned to irritation. But the woman's smile was disarming. Her eyes were welcoming. Flowing hair and dresses gave her a regal quality, while her soothing voice compelled one to safely offload all fears and anxieties. The stranger would listen and advise.
  

  
Though she was easy to open up to, the conversations could be difficult. No matter the topic, she'd always find a way to shift it. Work and casual relationships didn't interest her. Every problem had to have its roots traced back to some deeper meaning.
  

  
""How's your relationship with your brother?"" she might've asked. ""Are you as close as you'd like to be?""
  

  
A growing amount of women made their rounds to the derelict home. Her popularity grew and so did her garden. Greenery overtook the fences, the chipped walls. Sweet flowers blossomed and a pleasant scent spread wider and wider across the neighborhood. It was invigorating in the morning, relaxing in the evening, but there was a restlessness when the sun set. It persisted even in one's dreams.
  

  
In those dreams one would wander a labyrinth of the mundane, guided by sweet singing and flowers. To follow was to find fulfillment and power. And family. Fathers with straining bulges. Mothers in nothing but aprons. Brothers and sisters escaping the traps of their relationships to find perfection in one another.
  

  
Dulled by days of stress and instant gratification, most forgot their dreams. Others woke in cold sweats, with lust leaking onto their bedsheets. Some ignored it while others gave in. And those who did realized that giving permission to those forbidden thoughts offered strange rewards. Mr. Grouse across the street found his cock straining more powerfully than it had in decades, and trembled at the realization that he'd just whispered his daughter's name. The more he said it the more he throbbed. Next door, Mrs. Jordan, numbed by the dullness of her day to day, stood blushing and naked in her bathroom with a perfect string of wetness hanging between her weakened knees. Curiosity had brought her far, but at the cusp of something wonderful she immersed herself in cold water to fight off the forbidden. Another moment of picturing her son's cock and she knew she'd be cumming without even touching herself.
  

  
When morning came and the flowers smelled as invigorating as fresh coffee, eyes met around kitchen tables. Fearful and awkward, one would wonder if their thoughts were somehow known. And while some were indeed still blissfully ignorant, you were not alone. But some practically floated over to the stranger's house in adoration, finding their satisfaction and fortune looking up.

Hi. Kind of a hypno/corruption/transformation vibe (though not to the point of permanent bimboism, preferrably). This can be light or heavy depending on your mood. Fun surrealism or a disturbing fever dream!

26 [M4F] #Philadelphia - Looking for a Domme to train me to be her perfect sub/ slave,"Hi everyone. I'm a Philly area sub looking for a lovely Domme to train me and make me whatever she wants. I'm 26 years old, white, with brown wavy hair and brown eyes. I wear glasses and have a bit of a nerdy look. I've been called cute a bunch for what it's worth and look a bit younger for my age. If we get talking I'll certainly send a picture.

I'm looking for a Domme that wants a compliant sub to be exactly what she wants. I'd love to be completely owned, a slave for the right person. I'd feel right at home in a FLR. You could certainly allow my input on things, but I'd love to have no choice and give up my freedom (within sane limits of course). But if you'd want to tease me and use me, I'd want my body to be owned by you. If you want to tie me up and ignore me completely, I'd love to please you that way, no matter how gentle or harsh. I could be your footstool, locked in a cage, whatever you want to do to a sub you own. Something 24/7 would be a dream, but of course it takes time to build up trust.

I'm very submissive by nature especially my personality. I'm kind of shy, especially when I first meet someone and tend to get, but I quickly warm up as I know people better. I think that's why it's kind of hard to write a post like this and to put my thoughts and feelings into words. However, I'm really into all different flavors of sub-Domme relationships and would love to explore. Ultimately whatever you want will be all that matters.

For instance, I'd love to be loved and cared for as someone's valuable property. To slowly give up more and more control to someone who wants obedience, to train me and to improve me. I'd love for you to make me the best me I can be. And I'd love to serve and obey your commands to make that happen. I'd love to be played with as a toy, embarrassed, used, abused, but also cared for. I'd make your pleasure my prerogative and if I deserve it you will reciprocate.

However, you could be harsh if you wanted. If you wanted, you could spank me, whip me, treat me very harshly if I do anything less than your standards. Again, I want you to be happy and use me however you want.

In a relationship like this, I'd love to eventually build up a level of trust where I could confide everything in you. Where I can stop worrying about the world for a bit and give up control. I'd love to be commanded to do what you pleased (within reasonable and safe limits, of course), free from making decisions. I'd certainly return the favor as best as I could and try to be the best sub I could be.

As for particular kinks, I LOVE bondage the most. Nothing is better than that helpless feeling and having no real control. It takes a lot of trust, but is worth it. I love everything that goes with it like rope, chains, cuffs, gags, blindfolds, collars, leashes, etc. Orgasm control is another amazing thing and it doesn't take much to make me beg. I'm like putty in my Domme's hands. I've been told I make very expressive facial expressions and cute noises. I'm also really into things like spanking, tickling, and more gentle kind of pain, not extreme stuff. However, I like to be pushed to the limit and give you as much discretion as possible. I love sensual types of domination like teasing. Hard limits I suppose are extreme pain, permanent marks and damage, and findom.

I also really love the mental side of D/s. I've recently gotten into erotic hypnosis which is an awesome add on to any BDSM relationship. With hypnosis, the only limit is the imagination. I myself am a VERY suggestible subject and easily go under. There's so much fun stuff to do with hypno. You could tie me up with just a special word, or make me automatically obey your commands without even thinking. It really enhances these types of relationships. If you want a completely brainwashed obedient slave, you could certainly use it as a tool to train me.

Anyway, to I'm open to almost every kink at least once. I just really like pleasing my partner in any way that she wants that I can fulfill, so feel free to ask me about anything I mentioned.

If you'd like to get to know me better personally and through hobbies, I'm a big fan of reading pretty much anything and everything and I've been trying to get into classical literature more recently. Aside from literature, I always read the news and keep up with current events. I'm a big nerd when it comes to international relations, politics, history, and philosophy and love conversation in areas like that. I LOVE music and like indie, alternative, psychedelic rock, prog rock, and hip hop generally but not exclusively that. I'm also a fan of some sci-fi and really too many TV shows and movies to mention (but who isn't honestly). I love conversation and will talk to pretty much anyone about anything that's interesting. I go off on crazy tangents and end up on a completely different topic. I also end up debating people on anything or playing devil's advocate. I also love nature and the outdoors. I try to go camping or hiking when I can.

I think that's everything. If that sounds like something you're interested in, I hope you send a message. I can talk on here and on chat apps.

28 [M4F] [#Online] Submissive male interested in writing erotic stories for a fun and creative woman. Example work inside!,"Hi there, 

I am a 28 year old white male from the US looking to write erotic stories for a fun and creative woman. 

These stories would be tailored to your interests, and would be provided either daily or weekly depending on the length and complexity. 

So what‚Äôs in it for me? 

1) I like to write, and 

2) I get a lot of pleasure out of pleasing others, and want to entertain a woman who deserves it. I know your life is busy, and after a long day you probably just want to come home, relax, and forget about the craziness for a bit. I‚Äôd love to provide you with that escape! 

Please let me know if you‚Äôre interested! I hope to hear from you soon. 

EXAMPLE: 

Below are Parts 1 &amp; 2 of a story I am writing about a femdom and forced feminization fantasy. Your stories do not need to be about these topics, but this should give you an idea of my writing ability and what to expect. Enjoy! 

SISSY SLUT SKYLAR - PART 1

As I sat in my car waiting for a break in the rain, I wondered to myself ""How did I get here?"". Of course, I knew the literal answer; I took the highway 15 miles from Exit 14 to 18, then made two lefts and a right to arrive at a beautiful home just off a lake. What I was more curious about was how I, a small submissive boy, turned my long-time fantasy into a very real opportunity.   

The house I sat in front of belonged to Mark and Sarah, an adventurous couple I had met and vetted online earlier that year. They were older than me by ten years or so, but couldn't have been past their mid-thirties. Mark was a taller man of around 6'2"", while Sarah was an average height of about 5'4"". They were both extremely fit, and looked like the type of couple that would have been Homecoming King &amp; Queen had they met in high school. Mark had the jock look going for him, and Sarah was a busty blonde with toned abs and a thick, voluptuous ass. 

But most importantly, Mark and Sarah were a genuinely nice couple that wanted to help me explore a very specific fetish - forced feminization.

Forced feminization had been a fetish of mine for years. I first became aware of the kink as a teenager, and began dressing privately in college. Now, I have a closet full of shoes, skirts, blouses, dresses, wigs, jewelry, and, of course, the lingerie to tie it all together. But to me, true feminization requires a level of dedication beyond just the outfits. It requires a lifestyle change that few are ready to make. The events of that day certainly illustrate this point well. 

I woke up naturally around 9am in a Victoria's Secret pajama set that was included as a gift to a recent purchase. After rolling around in the sheets for a few minutes, I got out of bed to use the bathroom. Even though I only had to pee, I sat down on the toilet and used that 30 seconds or so to check my social media for any fun gossip or important updates. 

Next, I changed into some athletic clothing and prepped for the gym by making a fruit smoothie. Since my ongoing goal is to achieve a more feminine figure, my diet mostly includes small portions of fruit, vegetables, and lean meats throughout the day. This is complemented by a work-out routine focused on building muscle in my legs, butt, and abs, and toning most other muscle groups. On this particular day, my work-out included a two-mile run, 3 sets of hip-thrusts, 3 sets of weighted lunges, squats, and explosive bodyweight exercises. 

After the gym, I returned home to shower. I knew that I would be seeing Mark and Sarah later that day, so I decided to shave everything but the hair on my head to be sure that they would be satisfied with my appearance. Mark specifically requested that I stretch out for him, so I also took the time to work a three inch metal plug into my asshole.

By this time, it was noon and I was ready to go out shopping. Sarah had given me a very specific list of items to purchase, and insisted that I buy everything in person to prevent me from hiding my true self behind a computer. My first stop was Target, where I purchased a pair of white stockings, foundation, blush, mascara, and lipstick (each of which was a specific brand and product number that she identified). I also bought a tight, light pink mini dress that she had seen there earlier in the week. To make sure it fit properly, she had me try it on in the dressing room and send her pictures for her approval. 

Next, I drove to Victoria's Secret and picked out a white lace bra and panty set, with a garter to match the stockings I bought earlier. I knew my sizes from previous purchases, so I didn't have to ask the staff for help. However, an attractive manager did catch me holding the bra up to my shirt (in an effort to see how it would look), which was extremely embarrassing. 

Lastly, I went to my local post office to pick up a mystery package that Mark and Sarah had ordered for me as a gift. I had absolutely no idea what it could be - but was so excited to find out. My nerves had me shaking so much that my plug almost fell out of my ass as I approached the counter, but the man working there couldn't care less. In fact, he laughed to himself a bit as if he knew I had an erection, but gave me the package anway after a few minutes of conversation. 

When I got home, I immediately placed the package on the counter and began to open it. Inside was a pair of light pink stilettos (about five inches tall), with a thick strap that went around the ankle. But the ankle strap wasn't held together with a traditional buckle. Instead, each heel had a tiny lock on the strap. This insinuated that, once on, the shoes would not come off without a key. 

Beneath the shoes was another small box wrapped in pink paper with a white string, and a handwritten note from my playmates. The note read: 

""Our little Princess, 

Tonight, you will cease to be the man you are and you will become our perfect little sissy - Skylar. We expect you to arrive at our home at 8pm dressed in normal, masculine clothing, but be sure to bring all of your purchases, gifts, and other accessories in a separate bag. Miss Sarah will prepare you for your date with Mr. Mark, and may join the two of you if things go well. 

We can't wait to play with you Skylar... 

Mark and Sarah

PS -  Do NOT open the small box. You will open that in front of Miss Sarah later tonight.""  

My mind raced - what could be in the box? How would Miss Sarah ""prepare"" me for my date with Mr. Mark? There were too many questions and too much excitement, but only one way to enjoy it all... 

Which brings me back to my car. It was now 7:55pm, and the sissy hypno podcast I was listening to was fading out. There was a break in the rain, and my heart began to pound. It was now or never. 

I got out of my car and approached the door. With a deep breath, I knocked, and waited for my fantasy to start...  

SISSY SLUT SKYLAR - PART 2

I waited with excitement on Mark and Sarah's front porch. It was a pretty entranceway with ornate wood trim, and a large brass knocker in the middle of the door. To keep myself calm, I tried to focus on the dimly lit flowers to the right of the steps, instead of the tasks that awaited me inside the house. The flowers were well kept - a sign that Mark and Sarah looked after their property. I wondered if they would take care of me, their new pet, with the same care. 

As instructed, I was not wearing any of my feminine clothing. Instead, I was wearing ""masculine"" jeans and a t-shirt, and carried my outfit for later that night in a gym bag that I held with my left hand. The bag also held the beautifully wrapped box that my playmates had instructed me not to open, as well as the handwritten note that came with it. 

I had knocked about fifteen seconds ago, but at this point it felt like an eternity of waiting. A rush of panic started to come over me, and I wondered if I had made a mistake. Was I being stood up? What if they weren't the same people that I had become comfortable with over the past several weeks? Is it possible that I had been FaceTiming frauds? 

As these thoughts raced through my head, I began to question my decision to knock and decided to walk back to my car. I turned around to leave the porch, but before I took my first step, the door suddenly opened. It was then that I heard the three words that changed my life... 

""Hey there sweetie...‚Äù

I turned back around slowly to see Sarah in the doorway wearing a tight black dress and holding a glass of red wine. She was even more beautiful than I envisioned - blonde hair, large chest, toned body, and a face that would make anyone smile. 

""Yes Miss Sarah"", I responded, ""I am. And I must say, you look absolutely gorgeous. Master Mark is very lucky to have you"". 

""Aw thank you sweetie"", she responded, ""We are lucky to have each other. And if things go well tonight, maybe we'll have you too."" 

My heart was beating out of my chest. If just conversing with Sarah face to face was enough to turn me on, God only knows what would happen once I got inside. 

""Oh thank you Miss! I would love nothing more than to serve you both. May I come inside?"" 

""Not so fast"", she said, ""There is something I need you to know first. Once you enter this home, you will no longer be the man you were raised to be. Instead, you will become Skylar - our personal sissy slut, submissive to us in every way, both sexual and otherwise. You will be responsible for satisfying our every need, from performing chores to physical pleasure, and everything in between. In exchange, we promise to support your feminization goals, honor your limits, and help you explore any fantasy that interests us both. Are you willing to begin this transformation?""

I paused for a second to think clearly about her offer, but shortly thereafter responded, ""Yes Miss Sarah, I am ready"". 

""Good"", she said with a smile. ""Now hand me that bag and let me see what you brought for us tonight"". 

I handed my gym bag to Sarah. She unzipped the top to reveal the pink mini dress I had bought earlier that day, my makeup bag, stockings, bra, panties, garter, a brunette wig, and the heels she had sent me as a gift. After she rummaged through these items a bit, she also found the small, gift wrapped box. 

""Ah, good"", she said, ""You didn't forget my special box.""

""No Miss, I followed your instructions to the letter. May I come in now, it's raining and cold."" 

""Yes you may"", she responded with a grin, ""But I will not have those masculine clothes in my home. Take them off and wash yourself while I finish my wine.""

I didn't understand what she meant, and stood there puzzled for what felt like a minute before she took the time to clarify her words. 

She said, ""There will never be any trace of your masculinity in this house. Before I allow you to enter, you will strip naked, step off the porch, and clean yourself off in the rain. Your feminization journey cannot begin until you wash away your manhood."" 

I stayed quiet for several seconds. 

""Don't make me tell you again sweetie, I don't like repeating myself"". 

I took a deep breath before saying, ""Yes, Miss Sarah. I understand."" 

I started with my shoes and socks, then proceeded to remove my pants, shirt, and underwear. Miss Sarah made me fold everything neatly and had me place everything in a pile on the porch (as they were not allowed inside). 

While I stood there naked in front of her, she sipped on her wine and looked me up and down. I was fully exposed, physically and mentally, and she knew it. 

""Turn around for me sweetie"" she said as she sipped on her glass. ""I want to take in every inch of you"". 

I did as I was told. She was happy with my appearance. My girl-oriented diet and exercise plan gave me a feminine figure, and I was completely shaved. Then, with a simple gesture of her hand, she signaled for me to step out into the rain. Again, I did what I was told. 

The rain came down hard, and was extremely cold on my skin. It felt like an erotic ice bath as I moved my hands over my body in Mark and Sarah's front lawn. I could see Sarah smiling as she yelled out instructions... 

""Bend over!"" she yelled, ""Dance for me! Make sure you clean all your holes!""

I don't know how long I stayed in the rain, but it was long enough for my penis to shrivel up to a fraction of its normal size. When Sarah was satisfied with my cleanliness (and shrunken manhood), she invited me back to the porch and handed me a towel. I dried off in front of her while she finished her last sip of wine. 

""Good"", she said. ‚ÄúBut there is one more thing we must do before we can begin.""

""What is it, Miss Sarah?"", I asked with a confused look on my face. 

""This"", she responded. Sarah held out the small gift wrapped box that was given to me earlier that day. ""Open it for me, sweetie, I want to see the look on your face when you do."" 

I opened the box slowly and deliberately, only to find a small pink, plastic chastity cage resting on a tiny white pillow. My heart leapt with excitement, while my stomach dropped simultaneously. I didn't know whether to be happy or sad. Hopeful or helpless. All I knew was that my past life was over. 

""This cage is a symbol of your dedication to us, and to your journey"", Sarah said with a cheeky grin. ""From now on, you will be caged at all times unless I, or Master Mark, decide to release you. These are the terms of our agreement - do you understand?""

Again, I paused. But after several moments, I replied ""Yes Miss Sarah, I do.""

With that, Sarah took the cage out of my hands and got on her knees before my naked body. She placed the cage on my shriveled penis and locked it with a tiny lock she had pulled from her pocket. As she did this, I could see the accompanying key on a necklace around her neck, resting in between her cleavage. 

When was done, she stood up and walked inside the house. Once in the foyer, she turned around and said to me, ""Are you coming Skylar?""

Without saying a word, I stepped into the home. I was naked, caged, and ready to begin my journey.

"27 [M4F] I want to be your Daddy, Husband, Rapist, your‚Ä¶ everything","Let me start by saying that I am aware that this post makes me come off as a little crazy, but you know damm well we all are a little crazy, including you the person reading this. I mean for ffs, look at the subreddit we are on.

Dating nowadays sucks. For both men and women. Men are passive, lazy, or just horny dogs. Women are shallow, mean spirited, and many who are developing more masculine traits for god knows what reason?
We are becoming more and more the opposite of what history has show made us attracted to each other and work better together, instead we are starting to hate each other, developing disdain for one another, it is trash.

We work best as a team. Women fascinate me, the way they think, the way they solve problems, the way they move across this earth. I‚Äôve always had more female friends, but I‚Äôve yet to find one that makes me want to change her last name to match mine. 

As you can see this is not your typical post, I‚Äôm not looking for something casual, not sugar babies, fwb, ect if I wanted that I‚Äôm sure there are easier ways for me than making a post here. 

Im looking for a younger girl to make mine, to mentor you, teach you how to look at life, teach you how to be free and happy, to get you addicted to me, obsessed, to give herself to me , your mind, your soul and your body, to me, to let me care for you. 
When ever you think of me when I‚Äôm not around, I want you to  smile, to feel butterflies in your chest, to feel yourself getting wet between your legs at just the thought of me, I want you to crave me so much that you give yourself to me, so I can do as I please, use you when ever I‚Äôd like, and you just being ecstatic that I‚Äôm giving you that attention you crave. Your body was designed to bring me pleasure, to bring us children. Do you want it any other way? Don‚Äôt you want to be cared for? Do you want to be protected? Don‚Äôt you want someone that you care about, to have moments where  they can not contain that inner animal inside of them, their lust for you that they pounce on you and use your body, you pretty holes for his pleasure? 

Sounds great right? Well I want to make clear again, that I‚Äôm not trying to make this a strictly sexual relationship, I‚Äôm quite the hopeless romantic honestly, always have been , when its not sexual I‚Äôll be a great man for you, still dominate and taking the lead in the relationship, but, caring and gentle when you require it from the outside, when we go on dinner dates, people won‚Äôt know that their is anything different from us or when we take kids to Soccer practice they‚Äôll just see us as a cute little couple, little do they know that at home you are my little play thing, choke you, bite you, slap that pretty pussy of yours., but we know, you know at dinner while I talk to you about work stuff that week, your thinking about me inside of you, wanting me to put my hands on you, someway, some form, because no matter how close we get its never enough for you, you want to be closer to me than humanly possible. I think that gives you a good picture of what I‚Äôm looking for, if you have any questions feel free to ask, and hopefully I can find that girl to mold you in to being my perfect little girl who will give me children and be by my side forever.

X,"This post was inspired by someone asking for sign language resources. 

I apologize for length and formatting. I spent all week editing and researching. I've divided this into sections so you can read the headers and read what you want. 

I don't expect anyone to read all of this or click on all the links or watch the videos in their entirety. Even I didn't read or watch everything beginning to end. **Find what you like and go from there.** Or save this and take some time going through it bit by bit. 

**Background** 

About me. I am at least proficient and at most conversationally fluent in ASL. I understand more than I can sign. I started learning 10y ago and it's been on and off. I've taken a few classes but learned a lot online and briefly had a Deaf roommate and friend. I'm by no means perfect but I know a lot and love when parents want to teach their kids to sign. 

Few disclaimers. This is for [American Sign Language](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language) and largely only applies to Americans and Canadians. Every country (to my knowledge) except Canada has their own sign language. It's not like English where it's widespread except for jargon and dialect. Brits have British sign language. Aussies have Auslan. Irish have Irish sign. You get the picture. Funny enough, ASL has more similarities to LSF (French) than other sign languages because [the man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hopkins_Gallaudet) that started the first Deaf school in the States studied in France along with a [Frenchman](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Clerc.) 

I will say that if you're in other countries but want to use ASL, as long as your kid knows to not use it outside the home, go for it. But if daycare uses your country's sign language, then learn what's native to your country. It is a communication tool. 

Another thing is ASL has regional differences. They're not huge but it's like how in CA I say ""soda"" but other states say ""pop"" or ""coke."" If you never intend to communicate with your local Deaf then you'll never have problems. And usually if you do they'll teach you the local sign. I said ""orange"" funny one time and got asked if I'm from NY and then got taught the CA version. There's also multiple signs for the same word. A lot of older folks use older signs. Even some older teachers will still teach the old sign. You can sometimes figure out where people or their teachers are from based on the signs they use and if the user is hearing, you can guess if their teacher is older. This is more fun fact than anything. 

An important note is the sooner you start teaching your kids the better. You don't wait until they babble to teach spoken language. You use it from birth. They're learning even if they're not using it back. I'll add as my own note that my older one didn't use her first sign until almost 1. She's picked up some signs faster than others just like words she can say. Studies show kids can sign as early as 5m (not gonna cite as I've read a few different things and every kid is different.) Much sooner than talking. Consistency is key, too. They're not gonna learn if you only do it once. Use it as much as you can. The more people who take care of baby, the better. If you want baby to sign ""milk,"" get all their caretakers to use it. 

One last thing is hand dominance. If you are right handed, use your right hand. Doesn't matter how baby mimics you for now. There are signs where one hand moves but the other doesn't. Your dominant hand does the motion. When you watch videos, copy with your dominant hand even if it's not the same as the teacher's. Another fun fact: you can tell if people are right or left handed when you sign with them. 

Also when you're watching, pay attention to detail. Your [palm orientation](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/palm-orientation.htm) (out, in, sideways), location (face, chest, etc), [hand shape](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/handshapes.htm), [facial expressions](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/facialexpressions.htm) (especially with questions), and [hand movement/direction](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/directionality.htm) are all super duper important. Any of those elements changing can change the meaning of the sign. For example, [""mom""])https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/m/mom.htm) and [""dad""](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/d/dad.htm) are the same hand shape but different location. [""Help me""](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/h/help.htm) and ""help you"" are the same sign but move in different directions. [""How""](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/h/how.htm) are you? and ""how"" do you do this? are the same ""how"" but different facial expression. [""My""]( https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/m/my.htm) and [""your""](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/y/your.htm) are the same hand shape but ""my"" is on my chest and ""your"" is facing whoever you're talking to (palm orientation.) These are all easy and common beginner mistakes. 

Some of what I mentioned can be more nuanced, but to learn the basics that's what you need to know. If you study more in depth you can learn the nuances and exceptions to the rules. 

**Resources** 

I'll share my resources and tell you how to vet the good from bad. 

[Bill Vicars](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/instructor.htm) is a Deaf/Hard of Hearing teacher up at Sacramento State. If you go on r/ASL he is one of the top recommended online resources. He has a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/billvicars) and a [website](https://www.lifeprint.com/index.htm.) He strives to make learning ASL free and accessible. Constantly uploading videos to YouTube on all sorts of subjects. He is an excellent resource but actual classes and practicing with others can't be replaced. 

He doesn't use voice in any of his videos but with his basic videos you can understand him well. He's actually hilarious and will tell jokes and you will get them. His videos can be long as he explains things. Sometimes it helps you understand the rest of it, sometimes it's a tangent. 

[This](https://youtu.be/ianCxd71xIo) is a great starting point if you know nothing. 100 basic signs. Easy to follow vocab only. It's not for babies but there's a lot of signs you'll want to teach baby, like family and basic foods. **If you watch anything I recommend, let this be it.** 

[This](https://youtu.be/1gS4DVjgLCI) is his parenting playlist. I will say from skimming it, it looks more for slightly older kids. But you can still learn a lot. He had a more baby focused one released last summer but it looks like he took it down because I can't find it on his channel anymore. 

[ASL THAT!](https://youtube.com/user/chsasl) is a great channel but it's less organized than Vicars'. This one does various subjects in separate videos. Vicars has actual lectures uploaded. If you're looking to seriously study, this is good for going in depth on one topic. I used him in one of my classes as a supplement. I believe he's a high school teacher. Vicars is a college professor. Also no audio. 

[Here](https://youtu.be/eeAq4gkOEUY) is the alphabet. It's a bit fast but pause and rewatch as needed. [Here](https://youtu.be/tkMg8g8vVUo) is another version that goes slower.

[Better video dictionary](https://gcdasl.com/) 

**Lesser favored** 

**The general rule of thumb is you want to use resources created by the Deaf. You should be able to understand without audio.** Like any language class, you don't learn that language by speaking English! An immersion environment is best. I can't go through everything but some stuff I've seen by hearing people is not great. ASL isn't just signs. There's grammar to it that goes out the window with hearing people and even if you just want to learn vocab, they're just not good videos. Some top YouTube results aren't good. Typing in ""baby sign language"" to YouTube yields some pretty bad results. Top page alone, [baby Einstein](https://youtu.be/dA9gQMuPraY) is the only good one and that's cuz [Marlee Matlin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlee_Matlin) is in it. It's really hard to learn from little kids cuz they don't do things perfectly (think of them saying ""wada"" instead of ""water."") 

I'm including links to things I don't like to allow you to make your own opinion. 

[ASL Nook](https://youtube.com/c/SheenaMcFeely) is kinda hit or miss. Yes they're a Deaf family using the right signs and grammar. My issues with them are they don't always show the sign clearly and it's harder to understand little kids. They also exaggerate movement, which little kids like (similar to how you might elongate words or use an exaggerated tone with kids; like a story telling voice) but that's not how you sign in normal conversation. They use other signs besides the ones they're trying to teach but they don't tell you what they mean and then it's hard to distinguish the one they meant to teach. No video captions to fill in blanks. If you know some signs you can follow. But knowing nothing, they're hard to follow. I only skimmed a few videos so maybe some are better than others. 

[Sign time](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2qLnnrBIAdqvbHUiuPmH6w) is a great example of someone you shouldn't use. This [Rachel lady](https://www.signingtime.com/about-us/story/) seems like exactly who most people who know ASL will tell you to avoid. She's not really doing sign language. I don't like any of the channels she's on from quick glimpses at several. 

Editing to say I didn't know Leah was Deaf. But it still greatly bothers me how much they talk on that channel. One of the things I saw them practice was more [""English""](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_Exact_English), *which isn't the same as ASL* and isn't even a language. [This video at 1.52](https://youtu.be/CZ8vYeczZrc) is what I mean. You don't say ""what's your name?"" You say ""your name what?"" And her eyebrows (facial expression) aren't correct for a wh/what question. This is why I don't like her. That's ASL 101. [This video](https://youtu.be/pKsVUG3gl5U) shows you the right way at 3.11. I don't like all the talking but it's a good explanation. 

Funny enough, her website has a lot of correct information. I wonder why she signs more English and uses so much voice. For someone who appears well educated on ASL and [Deaf culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deaf_culture), that's really surprising. 

I can't find any online criticism of her from anyone, including the Deaf community. The only thing I found is she doesn't have teaching credentials or licenses. She is very popular. I haven't watched an entire video but I did watch a chunk of that one. All I'll say is: Talking? Not good. Incorrect sentence structure? Bad. Incorrect facial expression? Very bad. If you're gonna learn a language, do it right, right? 

Sign language isn't just signs. It's facial expression, body language, [grammar](https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/grammar.htm). That's why a lot of hearing people get it wrong. That's why I'm saying avoid mommy bloggers and people like Rachel. You can change the meaning of your sign greatly with just your facial expression, much like the tone of your voice. 

**Last notes.** 

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/asl/comments/5xrtiu/the_free_asl_resources_and_faq_thread/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) is a great post from r/ASL. If you want to learn more, read it. There are other resources here that I'm not listing. 

You are, of course, welcome to use whatever resources you want and have access to. I'm just here to share what I think is best but my opinion is just an opinion. If you like Rachel, that's your opinion. If you don't like the videos I shared, that's your opinion. I'm just here to share what I think will help you learn, especially since I know ASL and Deaf culture and have a good idea what other people will tell you is best. This is a guide. 

[This](https://www.gallaudet.edu/asl-connect/asl-for-free) is a great learning tool for adults from Gallaudet University, the only Deaf college in the US. Not baby specific though. 

Extended reading. Scroll down for ""baby signing"" (9 links), and ""children: benefits of learning sign language."" I didn't look through all of it. [Link](https://www.lifeprint.com/index.htm). Go down to ""resources"" then ""lifeprint library."" 

I don't have book recs because I personally find it hard to learn correct movement from a still page. I have [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1563682826/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_ES1ZZEXENKS8QZAP7MQN) bad boy, which weighs a ton and isn't for kids. There is a kid [version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1563686317/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_CXCQ7FVDCJRBY2PSM081). 

**Just for fun watching.** 

AKA you don't want to go through the study material but you're bored feeding or nap trapped and think music videos and TED talks are cool. 

Here is a cool discussion on [rhyming in ASL.](https://youtu.be/rIoFpxAo93U) 

[These](https://youtu.be/QZgy91RJasY) are [great examples](https://youtu.be/ac2WdmlzmuM) of story telling and rhyming. Note what I said about ASL nook. See how they also exaggerate signs? Very kid friendly. 

[More](https://youtube.com/channel/UCfxOHNIj_bX97uSdUAK6hSA), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/user/RMDSCO). 

[Here](https://youtu.be/y23fcuSBD5c) is a book signed. I like this channel. She tells the story then teaches the signs at the end. Uses ASL grammar.

Ingrid Michaelson's [""Hell No""](https://youtu.be/79N7Tn2fDjM) Done as a collab with [Deaf West Theatre](https://www.deafwest.org/) 

Here's a great TED talk on the different elements of [ASL grammar](https://youtu.be/2Euof4PnjDk). There are several TED talks on ASL and Deaf culture. This is just one I like. 

And if you didn't know, Sesame Street used to have a Deaf actress, Linda Bove. Here's a kinda [funny clip](https://youtu.be/GbfMzPuqSro.) There are others but this gives a look into what it's like being Deaf, as best as a little kid can understand. 

Finally, here's a [joke](https://youtu.be/bcF4N9dgW20.) 

If you have questions, let me know. I'm happy to answer what I can or point you in the right direction.

Five Nights at Freddy's Sister Location Explained,"After a while of procrastinating, here it is, Five Nights at Freddy's Sister Location Explained!

-Title Screen-

Multiple title screens exist for this installment of the Five Nights at Freddy's series. All involve a character glitching out, the four characters available for this are Circus Baby, Ballora, Funtime Freddy, and Funtime Foxy.

-The Elevator-

The Elevator is made of metal, has windows on each side, and a window on each elevator door. A keypad, elevator button, a speaker, pipes, a vent, a Circus Baby poster, and a Ballora Poster are all present in the elevator. A large fan is present as a part of the elevator ceiling. A Bidybab can appear to the left of the elevator at random. When the elevator opens, it reveals a vent leading to the Primary Control Module.

-Primary Control Module-

The Primary Control Module features a vent and large windows to the left, which leads to Ballora Gallery, large windows and a vent to the right that leads to Funtime Auditorium, a vent ahead that leads to the Circus Control Room, a vent with a fan is above the Circus Control Room vent, a Circus Baby clock is to the left of the wall ahead, along with a speaker, lights, three heads, a gypsy toy, along with a shock and light button on the left and the right, one for Ballora Gallery and another for Funtime Auditorium. The mask of Ennard sits on the wall ahead often, until Night 5, in which it'll be gone. On rare occasions the Ennard Mask can be replaced by Lolbit. A Minireena can appear spinning on the left of the room on rare occasions. The Primary Control Module has a camera present to the right.

-Circus Control Room-

The Circus Control Room has three large windows facing Circus Gallery, and it has a table with levers, buttons, and screens. A magician toy is seen sitting to the right of the table while a magician toy is seen hanging to the left of the middle window. Lights are above the middle window. A Circus Baby poster is on the right window. A Bidybab can appear by the window on the other side of the glass on rare occasions. A controlled shock and light button are present in this location. A crawlspace is built under the desk, with a cover present for those hiding under the crawlspace. It is unknown how workers get to and from Circus Gallery and Circus Control, it's possible that a maintenance vent is under the desk. Circus Control has two cameras present in the room.

-Circus Gallery-

Circus Gallery is an unseen room containing Circus Baby and the Bidybabs.

-Ballora Gallery-

Ballora Gallery is a room with pipes on the walls, and the room leads to the Breaker Room. Ballora Gallery has a stage which Ballora and the Minireenas reside on.

-Breaker Room-

The Breaker Room door has a poster of Funtime Freddy on it. Inside the breaker room, tons of pipes and wires are present, along with a poster of Funtime Foxy to the left, and a stage in the back right. Funtime Freddy resides on the stage alongside his hand puppet, Bon Bon. The breaker control system is present in this location.

-Funtime Auditorium-

Funtime Auditorium is a room containing pipes, and a stage which Funtime Foxy stands on. Starting from the Primary Control Module vent, ahead is the Parts &amp; Service Room, to the right is the Scooping Room, and to the left is the Private Room. While crossing through Funtime Auditorium, Yenndo has a rare chance of appearing instead of Funtime Foxy. Ennard can appear maskless in this location.

-Parts &amp; Service-

The Parts &amp; Service Room has pipes on the walls, and a conveyor belt that leads to the Scooper Room, and has a button to send animatronics to that location. Funtime Freddy, Bon Bon, and Circus Baby can be worked on in this location. A maskless Ennard will appear behind Circus Baby while working on her.

-The Scooping Room-

The Scooping Room is a room with two large windows leading to the scooping control room. Inside the scooper room is The Scooper, also known as S.C.U.P.(Scalable Creation of Ulterior Presence), which is a machine used for injected remnant and or souls, as well as dismantling animatronics. Circus Baby, Ballora, Funtime Freddy, Bon Bon, Funtime Foxy, the Minireenas, Ennard, and an unidentified Springlock suit all make appearances in this location.

-The Private Room-

The Private Room has a starting area, which has a desk, three monitors, a keypad, a speaker, a vent ahead, a door to the left and right, a fan on the left of the desk, and a window to the right. The Fredbear Plush resides on this desk next to a remote control. When the code of ""1983"" is typed on the keypad, the monitors will activate, one showing the front facing view of Michael's Bedroom, another showing Michael's Bed, and a third showing the Fun with Plushtrap Hallway. A Circus Baby poster is present in the room.

CAM 01 is a hallway to the left of the Private Room, and has a closet to the left, and another hallway ahead.

-CAM 02-

CAM 02 is a hallway to the right of the Private Room with another hallway ahead, and a closet to the right.

-CAM 03-

CAM 03 is a closet connected to the CAM 01 hallway. It contains a light and pipes.

-CAM 04-

CAM 04 is a closet connected to the CAM 02 hallway. It contains a light and pipes.

-CAM 05-

CAM 05 is a vent connected to the Private Room, leading to an area in between CAM 06 and CAM 07.

-CAM 06-

CAM 06 is the left side of a hallway that's at the end of the CAM 01 hallway. It contains oxygen tanks and pipes.

-CAM 07-

CAM 07 is the right side of a hallway that's at the end or the CAM 02 hallway. It normally contains just pipes and switches. However, in the non-canon Custom Night, it has a purple-curtain stage containing Funtime Foxy.

-Michael Afton's Living Room-

Michael Afton's Living Room has a TV on a table, a lamp on a table, a star clock, and some pictures. Bidybabs and Minireenas can appear in the house, with a Minireena even having a chance of appearing in Michael's popcorn! Ennard also appears here in the non-canon ending to Sister Location.

-Chica's Party World-

Chica's Party World is a spin-off location that originally opened somewhere between 1983-1985, and closed somewhere between 1986-1993. The location reused Fredbear's Family Diner and had two animatronics stationed at it, that being Funtime Chica and Music Man. The location used to have Springlock suits, but after multiple failures at the location, the springlock suits were retired, and later the location's safe room was sealed off. Chica's Party World did rent out items from Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental during the events of the game, which took place in 1986.

-Breaker Room Map-

The Breaker Room Map is a map tracking the animatronic. The map is only shown during the Night2 Breaker Room segment. During this segment, Circus Baby is shown in Circus Gallery, Ballora is shown in Ballora Gallery, Funtime Freddy is shown in the Breaker Room, and Funtime Foxy is shown in Funtime Auditorium. The map shows the FNaF4 Minigame Map, with a secret entrance between Circus Gallery and Fredbear's Family Diner. The map also shows an entrance from the CAM 06/CAM 07 Hallway to Michael Afton's house. Another secret passage connects Ballora Gallery to the Fun with Plushtrap Hallway. Funtime Chica and Music Man are present in Chica's Party World, which used to be Fredbear's Family Diner. Five Minireenas are present in the Plushtrap Hallway area. Four Bidybabs are shown at Michael Afton's house.

-Circus Baby-

Circus Baby is a large clown girl with orange pigtail hair, pure white skin, red lips, a red nose, red clothes, a red skirt, and gold bells on her shoes. She also has the ability to send out a metal claw from her stomach to snatch children, and her face can split open. Circus Baby can dance, sing, take song requests, inflate balloons at her fingertips, and she can dispense ice cream. She starts out with blue eyes, but later gains green eyes after being possessed by Elizabeth Afton. In 1983, she was set to star in Circus Baby's Pizza World as a way to kill and capture children to get remnant for William Afton. However, her first kill was Elizabeth Afton, causing William to fake a gas leak in Circus Baby's Pizza World to close it down. William Afton took Circus Baby to Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental at first, but later took Circus Baby through his Midnight Motorist/Fun with Plushtrap house, where Elizabeth's soul latched on Evan Afton's Fredbear Plush, leaving behind her remnant in Circus Baby, William Afton then took Circus Baby into the forest, removed the corpse of Elizabeth Afton to bury her, and sent Circus Baby back to Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental. While Elizabeth has some level of control over Circus Baby because of the remnant connection, though because remnant is weaker than a soul, it's a mix between the AI's murderous personality and Elizabeth's personality. Circus Baby has control over the Bidybabs. Circus Baby is voiced by Heather Masters. Circus Baby is 7.2 feet tall, weighs 585 pounds, has an air hose attachment at her fingertips, an internal ice cream dispenser in her stomach, a song databank in her head, and an emergency stop by her legs.

-Ballora-

Ballora is a ballerina with magenta eyes, blue eyelids that are normally shut, blue hair, jewelry, a purple skirt, gold earrings, and pure white skin.  She's given sentience by a remnant mixture from the spirits of Gabriel, Jeremy, Susie, Fritz, Cassidy, and Evan Afton. Ballora was made in the image of William Afton's wife. Ballora has control over the Minireenas. Ballora is voiced by Michella Moss. Ballora is 6.2 feet tall, weighs 347 pounds, has an audio activation sensor by her head, a deter and misdirect remote activation by her shoulders, a balance/stabilizer by her waist, and collision sensors in her legs.

In the non-canon Custom Night, Ballora is an antagonist who approaches from CAM 01 and CAM 02 hallways, but she's invisible to the cameras, so instead the player must listen for her music to know when and what door to close to avoid her. She also jumpscares the player when they run out of power.

-Funtime Freddy-

Funtime Freddy is a white and magenta bear with a speaker on his chest, a black bowtie with two buttons, and a black tophat with a magenta ribbon, and he has blue eyes. Funtime Freddy is missing his right hand, which is replaced by his hand puppet; Bon Bon. Funtime Freddy is made sentient by a remnant mixture from the spirits of Gabriel, Jeremy, Susie, Fritz, Cassidy, and Evan Afton. Funtime Freddy has the ability to open his chest and face, he also has a storage tank like Circus Baby. Funtime Freddy is voiced by Kellen Goff. Funtime Freddy is 6.0 feet tall, weighs 350 pounds, his hat stores a proximity sensor and group coordination, Bon Bon serves as a 360 parental tracking device, his chest speaker serves the purpose to mimic voices for luring, and his storage tank is in his stomach.

In the non-canon Custom Night, Funtime Freddy appears in CAM 03 or CAM 04. If Funtime Freddy shouts ""BON BON, GO GET 'EM"" he'll throw Bon Bon to go get the player. If he shouts ""BON BON, GO GET 'EM"" from CAM 03, the player should shut the left door to avoid Bon Bon, if he shouts it from CAM 04, the player should shut the right. If he shouts ""GET READY FOR A SURPRISE"" from CAM 03 the player should shut the right door, if from CAM 04 the player should shut the left.

The prototype version of Funtime Freddy for the game was more pink instead of magenta, has both hands, was missing his speaker, and has four buttons instead of two.

-Bon Bon-

Bon Bon is a blue hand puppet without legs, who has purple eyes, red cheeks, a single button and a red bowtie. Bon Bon is controlled by Funtime Freddy, or he's controlled by a Mascot Audio Response system from the breaker room, which is used to calm down Funtime Freddy. Bon Bon is voiced by Becky Shrimpton.

In the non-canon Custom Night, Funtime Freddy appears in CAM 03 or CAM 04. If Funtime Freddy shouts ""BON BON, GO GET 'EM"" he'll throw Bon Bon to go get the player. If he shouts ""BON BON, GO GET 'EM"" from CAM 03, the player should shut the left door to avoid Bon Bon, if he shouts it from CAM 04, the player should shut the right. If he shouts ""GET READY FOR A SURPRISE"" from CAM 03 the player should shut the right door, if from CAM 04 the player should shut the left.

-Funtime Foxy-

Funtime Foxy is a white, pink, and dark magenta fox with yellow eyes, and has a tail unlike other Foxy incarnations, though he also has a speaker and red bowtie. He has faceplates that can open. Funtime Foxy is given sentience by the remnant of the spirits of Gabriel, Jeremy, Susie, Fritz, Cassidy, and Evan Afton. Funtime Foxy is 5.9 feet tall, weighs 290 pounds, a light activation sensor by his head, his speaker serves as a parental voice sync and replay, his tail serves the purpose of releasing scents, and his feet serve as remote floor anchors.

In the non-canon Custom Night, Funtime Foxy starts at the CAM 07 stage. Funtime Foxy will slowly emerge from his stage, if the curtains are pulled back and Funtime Foxy is missing, the player should close the right door to avoid him.

The prototype version for Funtime Foxy for the game was missing his bowtie, and he was more of a lighter pink, and he had a purple instead of a dark magenta color.

-Bidybab-

Bidybabs are small human-like animatronics with faceplates that can split open. Most have blue eyes, but the lead one has purple eyes. Bidybabs are controlled by Circus Baby. The lead Bidybab is voiced by Zehra Jane Naqvi.

In the non-canon Custom Night, a Bidybab can attack from the CAM 05 vent, which the player can avoid by closing the vent door when the Bidybab gets too close.

-Minireena-

Minireenas are white-masked tan-bodied miniature ballerinas. There are two types of Minireenas, the larger Minireenas have no eyes, and are shown dancing with Ballora on stage in Ballora Gallery, they also appear in the Primary Control Module, and Michael's house. Minireena 2s are a lot smaller, and have darker mouths and eyes, when jumpscaring their eyes become more visible to the player, showing mostly black eyes with yellow irises. Minireena 2s appear during the Night 4 Springlock suit minigame. The Minireenas are voiced by Brenda Joan Wong.

In the non-canon Custom Night, normally Minireenas can appear tampering with the oxygen at CAM 06, the player can send a controlled shock through the cameras to send the Minireenas away. Minireena 2s also appear, though instead they appear one at a time to slowly build up in numbers to block the player's view, they can't be stopped.

-Ennard-

Ennard is an amalgamation of Circus Baby, Ballora, Funtime Freddy, Bon Bon, and Funtime Foxy. Ennard appears sometimes with or without a clown mask and partyhat. Ennard is primarily controlled by Circus Baby. Ennard is voiced by Heather Masters.

In the non-canon ending to Sister Location, Ennard can appear in the Private Room area, and will try to attack the player, the player must close the left door if he appears by the Private Room door in CAM 01, it he appears next to the Private Room door in CAM 02 the player must close the right door. If Ennard appears in the CAM 05 vent, the player must close the vent door to avoid him.

-Yenndo-

Yenndo is a Funtime Freddy endoskeleton with both hands and yellow eyes. Yenndo was a prototype of Funtime Freddy that was put into storage and never finished, though he can still move due to the agony.

In the non-canon Custom Night, Yenndo can appear in the office, and to avoid him the player must flip the monitor up, if the player fails to do so they'll be jumpscared by Yenndo.

-Bonnet-

Bonnet is an unused Bon Bon prototype, which is pink and has green eyes, and she was put into storage and never used, and is never seen in the canon gameplay, though the lack of an explanation of why she's in Ultimate Custom Night seems to suggest she was a canon prototype who's simply unseen.

Bonnet appears in the non-canon Custom Night, as she crosses the Private Room. To avoid her jumpscare, the player must click on her nose.

-Lolbit-

Lolbit is an unfinished Funtime Foxy Prototype. Lolbit is missing her body, her eyebrows, and her exoskeleton eyes. She's also white, and has an orange secondary color and a purple tertiary color. Lolbit can appear due to agony.

Lolbit appears in the non-canon Custom Night. Her head will slowly appear on all three monitors in the private room, until she blocks the screen herself and plays a loud audio. The player must type ""LOL"" to avoid her.

-Electrobab-

Electrobab is a non-canon yellow-eyed Bidybab. Electrobab appears in the non-canon Custom Night. Electrobab will appear in CAM 03 or CAM 04 to drain power, to stop Electrobab the player must shock Electrobab through the cameras.

-Dark Springtrap-

Dark Springtrap is a burnt version of Springtrap who appears at the end of the last Custom Night cutscene. Dark Springtrap is Springtrap after the Fazbear's Fright fire, and before William Afton got the ""Scraptrap"" suit.

-Unidentified Springlock Suit-

The Unidentified Springlock Suit was a Springlock suit originally stationed at Circus Baby's Pizza World, which is seen in Night 4.

It's unknown what this belongs to, the faceplates don't match up with any other Funtime, as it's the only one that only has a face which opens, meanwhile the other animatronics have faceplates which open around the entire head. It's possible that the suit is a larger minireena, or a version of the Marionette, going by the suit's smile and lack of a snout.

-Michael Afton-

Michael Afton is a brown haired male with blue eyes. He's the player of Five Nights at Freddy's Sister Location, and he was ordered by William Afton to go and put Elizabeth Afton back together by working at Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental. Michael Afton is voiced by PJ Heywood.

-William Afton-

William Afton is the father of Michael Afton and Elizabeth Afton. He is also the creator of the Funtime animatronics, and the one who told Michael to go to work at Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental. He told him to put his sister back together, intending for him to put the soul in the Fredbear Plush and the remnant in the Circus Baby animatronic back together. William Afton is voiced by PJ Heywood.

-Elizabeth Afton-

Elizabeth Afton is the daughter of William Afton, and she has orange hair and green eyes. She got too close to Circus Baby despite her father's warnings, and was killed by Circus Baby. Elizabeth's soul was at first in Circus Baby, but when William was taking Circus Baby though the house and out to the woods, Elizabeth's soul latched onto Evan Afton's Fredbear Plush, leaving behind remnant in Circus Baby, meanwhile the soul was now in the plush, and William buried Elizabeth's body in the woods. Elizabeth Afton is voiced by Zehra Jane Naqvi.

-Board Members-

An unknown board member talks to William Afton about the design choices of Circus Baby in the opening cutscene of the game. The board member is voiced by John Matthew.

-Technicians-

Two unknown technicians appear in Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental. Both are voiced by Jason Kappus.

-Hand Unit-

Handyman's Robotics and Unit Repair System Model 5, also known as Hand Unit is the tutorial unit of Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental. Hand Unit is voiced by Andy Field normally, but voiced by Jesse Adam for the Angsty Teen voice.

-Female Computer Voice-

A Female Computer Voice announces vent openings, and motion triggers. It's voiced by Julie Shields.

-The Previous Technician-

The previous technician is an unknown male technician who worked before Michael. All that's known is he got past the desk phase and worked during the springlock suit phase of the Funtime's plans to escape, though he died and his body ended up in the vent between the elevator and Primary Control Module.

-Opening Cutscene-

In the opening cutscene, and Unknown Board Member is trying to ask William Afton for certain design choices of Circus Baby, when William Afton responds with her ability to inflate balloons at her fingertips, sing, dance, take song request, and dispense ice cream, the Board Member responds saying that those weren't the design choices they're curious about.

-Elizabeth Afton Cutscenes-

Cutscenes before every night depict Elizabeth Afton's voice begging her dad to let her go see Circus Baby, saying that William Afton made Circus Baby just for her. Later dialogue in these cutscenes depict her talking to Circus Baby after sneaking off, telling Circus Baby that she wanted to see the show too, also telling Circus Baby to not tell her dad she came to see her. Other voice clips involve her asking where the other children go, and her marveling about Circus Baby's features.

-The Immortal and the Restless-

The Immortal and the Restless is a soap opera Michael Afton watches at the end of each shift at Circus Baby's. The show has a narrator, and it focuses on a vampire named Vlad, and his romantic partner Clara as Clara fights to get Vlad to accept his own child as his, though the story is left off with Clara and Vlad happy with each other because Clara finds out Vlad got his ring for Clara through buying a kids meal. This relationship is a representation of the Afton family, with Vlad representing William Afton, Clara representing Mrs. Afton, and the child representing the Afton kids. It's meant to show the relationship between the family, showing that William Afton liked Mrs. Afton, but he doesn't care for his own kids Michael Afton, Evan Afton, and Elizabeth Afton. Vlad is voiced by Christopher McCullough, Clara is voiced by Amber Lee Connors, and the narrator is voiced by Bob Barnes.

-Night 1-

On Night 1, Hand Unit welcomes Michael Afton to his new job on the Elevator ride down. Hand Unit asks for Michael's name, and due to the Hand Unit's glitchy nature, it accidently labels Michael as ""Eggs Benedict"", though Michael corrects the mistake by putting a piece of tape labeled ""Mike"" on the Hand Unit tablet. Michael is instructed to check on Ballora and Funtime Foxy to make sure they're on stage, and he's told to shock them to get them back on stage. Michael is then told to head to Circus Control to check on Circus Baby. Hand Unit says some lights are out, but tells Michael to shock Circus Baby a few times, and later acts like Circus Baby is at her spot, despite not being visible to Michael. That concludes Michael's first shift.

-Night 2-

On Night 2, Hand Unit tells Michael Afton to select a new companion voice, but glitches out and chooses Angsty Teen. The Angsty Teen tells about how a dead body was found in the vents once, that being the body of the technician before Michael. Ballora appears as a silhouette against the glass, Hand Unit tells the player to check on and shock Ballora, before moving onto Funtime Foxy who's up against the glass as a silhouette, after shining a light on Funtime Foxy, the voice glitches out, and the default voice is restored. Then the Hand Unit sends Michael to Circus Control, and has him check on and shock Baby, but the shocks don't work. The Hand Unit goes offline to fix the system, saying that systems like oxygen, security doors, and vent locks have a chance of going offline during this. The lead Bidybab, who was at Michael's House according to the Breaker Room Map, heads to Circus Control, alongside other animatronics coming from Funtime Auditorium and Ballora Gallery. Circus Baby starts talking, instructing Michael to hide from Bidybab under the table, claiming the previous technician turned it into a hiding place previously. Michael then has to pull over a hiding cover and fend off Bidybab long enough for them to lose interest and leave. Once done with that, Circus Baby tells Michael to not listen to Hand Unit, and to slowly go through Ballora Gallery and to stop when he hears music. Hand Unit comes online, claiming to be unable to repair the system, and instructs Michael to head through Ballora Gallery to reach the Breaker Room. Michael does as such, and reaches the Breaker Room. There, Michael has to restart the system, while Funtime Freddy starts to approach. Michael uses a mascot response that uses Bon Bon to calm Funtime Freddy to get him back to his stage, after that he crawls through Ballora Gallery and ends his night.

-Night 3-

On night 3, Michael Afton is given an option for elevator music, and casual bongos are chosen. Michael has to check on Ballora, who's dismantled and held up by the Minireenas. Funtime Foxy has to be checked on also. The player can go to Funtime Auditorium as instructed, or they can go to Circus Control first. If they go to Circus Control, they'll be told a story by Circus Baby, and she'll explain how she was on stage for one day, she'll explain the story of how Elizabeth was killed. Once Michael heads to Funtime Auditorium, the player must use a flash beacon, and stop when they spot Funtime Foxy, and wait to flash to check if he's gone. Once the player reaches Parts &amp; Service they must do a series of events to take a power module out of Funtime Freddy, and then Michael must click Bon Bon's chest button. By removing the power module, the tracker that's used for the Breaker Room Map is removed from Funtime Freddy. When trying to leave, Michael is attacked by Funtime Foxy. After this, Funtime Freddy, Bon Bon, and Funtime Foxy are set up for Ennard, and Michael is set up for Night 4.

-Night 4-

Michael Afton wakes up in the Unidentified Springlock Suit in the Scooping Room next to Circus Baby. Circus Baby explains that the suit was from her old location, and that it wasn't used the way it was meant to be, that being it was used once by the previous technician. Circus Baby says the suit was too dangerous. She opens the faceplates for him, and says he needs to be careful and wind the springlocks, and that they loosen up when he nudges them. Two technicians come in with Ballora, and they use the scooper on her to break her. The two technicians leave, and Michael has to fend off against Minireena 2s until the Technicians manage to find and save him. After Michael is saved and sent home, Ballora is set up for Ennard.

-Night 5-

Michael Afton arrives at work, and he's told to select his basket, but it glitches out and it selects Exotic Butters. The Ennard Mask is now gone from the Primary Control Module. When Michael checks on Ballora and Funtime Foxy, he sees the two technicians, dead and hanging above the stages so that the Hand Unit will detect something on stage. By this time, Ennard is fully formed, and has the Exoskeleton and some of the Endoskeleton of Circus Baby set up at Parts &amp; Service, but this isn't the whole of Circus Baby. Once Michael arrives in Parts &amp; Service, Ennard hides behind Circus Baby and instructs Michael to open some panels up to get a keycard, and head to the Scooping Room. On the way there, Circus Baby will claim that Ballora is after him when in reality it's a maskless Ennard. The player has two choices now, to go left to the Scooping Room for the canon ending, or right to the Private Room for the non-canon ending.

-Canon Ending-

In the canon ending, Michael Afton heads to the Scooping Room, Ennard scoops Michael, wears his skin, and escapes to the surface.

-Non-Canon Ending-

In the non-canon ending, Michael goes to the private room, and has to fend off against Ennard until 6AM. During this, Fredbear Plush, which is possessed by Elizabeth Afton, will talk to Michael to bait him into giving up to Ennard so that she'll somewhat have control over someone who's not trapped inside Circus Baby's Entertainment and Rental, even if it's not full control. Michael, after winning, realizes what his dad meant by putting Elizabeth back together, and so he manages to put the soul back with the remnant, and he brings Ennard home. Ennard is no longer hostile against Michael, since he's not forced to stay underground anymore. Ennard was only acting hostile so that he could escape. Though in the canon ending, he fails to actually put her back together, and the animatronic is left murderous, even after escaping.

-Custom Night Cutscenes-

Michael Afton is shown slowly rotting until he spits out Ennard, after he does, he rises from the dead. The rotting is shown in several stages, first his skin starts rotting, and his eyes blacken. Next, one eye starts glowing, his skin rots further, and his hair falls out. Next, his skin turns purple, his hair is gone and both eyes are glowing. Last, he's a darker purple, and he's only wearing pants. After he spits out Ennard, Ennard reminds Michael that he can't die now. The reason why is because when he was scooped, the scooper put his soul back into his body. After the events of the minigames, Michael Afton heals, this is because possessing your own body can heal your corpse, but it won't remove the smell, and it can't heal if something, like Ennard, is obstructing it.

-Michael Afton's Threat-

After beating Golden Freddy mode in Custom Night, the remains of Fazbear's Fright are shown as Michael Afton makes a threat towards William Afton, and the cutscene ends with Dark Springtrap popping up. Michael starts his speech with an introduction, saying that he put Elizabeth Afton back together, since he thinks that the animatronics forming Ennard is putting her back together, though he's wrong about this since William really meant for him to take the soul from the plush and combine it with the remnant in the animatronic. Michael Afton then tells William the animatronics all thought he(Michael) was him(William). Michael says that Elizabeth is free, since she's roaming on her own now. Michael then says that he should be dead, but he's not and forced to live in the shadows now, he then makes a threat towards the on-the-run William Afton that he'll find him.

-Circus Baby's Minigame-

The minigame plays after deaths at random, in it the player must feed all the children in a time limit, the to to the end, get the ice cream, and go across the map to the left. Once done, Elizabeth will approach and get scooped. This minigame is likely one part of the spirit accessible realm, likely one that Elizabeth Afton is playing as a reliving of her own death.

-Stars-

The player can get a start from the Canon Ending, Non-Canon Ending, and from completing the Circus Baby minigame.

"Buckle up, this is a weird one","I tend to have very vivid and odd dreams. This one is from last night.
It started at work ( I am a dog groomer) and my coworker and friend broke her finger on the job. She didn't want to fill out an incident report so she was waiting till after work to go to the hospital. 
Fast forward to my house, where my coworker and other friends were at. I was scrolling through my co-workers Snapchat the first one was her face with her broken finger in frame and she wrote ""I drank too much and now my finger hurts so I'm going to the hospital"". The next Snapchat was a news story of a political protest turned violent filled with people who were on drugs or not mentally sane. The next Snapchat was my coworker in her hospital bed filming patients fleeing the hospital, patients that were part of the political protest. They were missing limbs or their intestines were outside of their body. They were holding their guts or running on bloody stumps to escape the custody of the hospital. 
I stopped looking at the Snapchat and realized these deranged, escaped, drugged up patients were going to terrorize the neighborhood and break into houses. All of my friends in my house were ready to leave, unaffected by the possibility of running into one of these patients. I was begging them to stay. 
At this point I realize that I have six doors to the outside of my house and ran to lock them all. As I approach the first door, a guy with no feet was trying to get in. I shove the door closed and lock it. Then me and him are running side by side, me inside, him outside, running to each door. I beat him to every door and locked them until the last one. At this point, all my friends left. He squeeze his way into the door and I push him out sending him down a flight of snowy, slippery stairs. He doesn't get up. He doesn't move. I realize he's probably dead and drag him into my garage. 
My brother now is trying to leave my house and I told him he's not allowed to leave without me. So we go to wherever he wanted to go (maybe some sort of flea market?) And we get separated. I realize I have to call the police about the dead guy who tried to break into my house who is now in my garage. 
I find a younger child also trying to walk home. We team up together and walk through crowds of crazed people. They tried to talk to us, poke us, get us to follow them. My brother finds me and picks us up in his car. I try to dial the police but the 911 call leads to a horrible automated robot conversation, similar to when you call your phone company and you have to speak to a robot and give all your information and they only understand half of it and make you repeat everything. I finally get ahold of a detective and he said he would meet me at my house to assess the situation. 
When we get to the driveway, the detective is there but I see my front door wide open. My heart dropped and I ran inside only to see my mom had returned home from work and left the door open as she normally does. I cried and hugged her only to realize I have to explain to her and the detective the situation of the dead guy in the garage. 
The dream ends there. One of the longest and most vivid dreams I've ever had. I woke up crying and terrified. Not a good way to start the day.",Dreams,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/pdjf4t/buckle_up_this_is_a_weird_one/,Long Dream,Admiralfrewt,pdjf4t,/r/Dreams/comments/pdjf4t/buckle_up_this_is_a_weird_one/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/pdjf4t/buckle_up_this_is_a_weird_one/,0,2021-08-28
M4A Slice of Life Style Weight Gain or Size Play/Shrinking and Growing.,"Hello! I‚Äôm a cis male, 30s, bi, and very much into two particular, in my mind related, kinks: weight gain/feedism and size play. I would love someone to RP with in a sort of cozy, domestic, slice of life type scenario.

With weight gain, I love mutual gaining. I would want to do a scenario where myself and a man or woman (or someone non binary) were dating or married, and were gaining weight together. Something is so wholesome and at the same time so sexy about a couple getting really comfortable in their relationship and starting to pack on the weight. All the better if they happen to be doing it intentionally. I‚Äôm happy to also RP more feeder/feedee scenarios where one partner doesn‚Äôt gain if that is more your speed. In either situation, I love a sort of mid speed build up. I want to be able to go slow enough to appreciate all the details along the way, but quickly enough to keep us both engaged. What is it like for us to keep outgrowing clothes? How do our bodies keep changing? Do we keep outgrowing parts of our home? What is sex like as we change? What is cuddling like? Normal chores? Dates?

By the same token, I‚Äôm also interested very much in other size play. In this scenario, I am MOST interested in a female partner who will end up being the larger/taller person, but I‚Äôm open to other things. I am just as interested in this being a slice of life as in the weight gain scenario. We are dating or married and my partner grows while I either stay the same or shrink. What is this like for us? Similar details to above: what is day to say life like? How is our dating affected? Sex? Etc.

A note on the size change stuff, I am really not into extreme size change, myself. At most, I would want to be half of the size of the other person. MAYBE a quarter of their size. When we get into them being big enough to step on a house or I‚Äôm the size of a mouse or something, I am just no longer interested. While sex isn‚Äôt the only thing I‚Äôm wanting to explore here, it should still be kept feasibly possible for our characters.

If you were down for it, it would be incredible to explore both of these at once.

I have a few limits. I am very much NOT interested in pain, blood, anything with children, any bodily fluids, non humans, or vore. No shame at all to you if you are into those things; they just aren‚Äôt for me. Unless you are into kids, in which case go get help, please.

DM me if you are interested!",DPPprofiles,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/pdjtxy/m4a_slice_of_life_style_weight_gain_or_size/,,Atreyu33331,pdjtxy,/r/DPPprofiles/comments/pdjtxy/m4a_slice_of_life_style_weight_gain_or_size/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DPPprofiles/comments/pdjtxy/m4a_slice_of_life_style_weight_gain_or_size/,0,2021-08-28
"Creative Civ 7 Ideas: Settlements, Trade, Economies","Played civ 5 loved it, never played civ 6 because of districts but liked some the newer concepts they added. Since everyone is posting ideas for the new game, I thought I‚Äôd add mine. Some of these are out there and unrealistic to ever make the game, but a little creativity and community discussion would be nice.

#Settlements(District Replacement System)
 
Problems with Districts: Adjacency planning is hard to learn, tedious and inflexible(Hard to reconstruct cities designs). Opinion: Cartoonish Large districts also unrealistic and make the game unenjoyable. Also makes it hard for modders to add content since easier to put a symbol than a 3D model. I think the AI struggles with long term planning of districts as well. Turns off a portion of older community.

The Good of Districts: Allow specialization with environment, create character in empire Manufacturing City, College City, Cattle City etc.

Extracting the specialization element I recommend keeping cities like Civ 5. I can build a Market/Aqueduct inside the city. Instead, adding specialistic settlements like Towns with adjacent Ranches/Hunting Villages/Plantations in between major cities and on the outskirts of territory. These settlements allow you to create specialistic buildings that better utilize distant resources for your major cities.

Settlers are still core of game. Still a settler rush to secure top city spots. Settlements are mainly to be developed in late classical/medieval. Towns are best placed in the middle of 5-8 tile gap between major cities next to smaller bunches of resources and placed on the outskirts of less contested territory.

Villages: Simply Long Range Tile Improvements. Created with culture like normal city expansion but creates a unit that allows you to set up a long range improvement 3-4 tiles from city/ 5-6 tiles if Fish/Camp. Villages are based on tech Mining/Hunting villages can be founded right at mining/archery while ranches/plantations require horseback riding and another classical era tech (farms/pastures build close to cities initially). Yields are initial lower but are improved by creating a town nearby. Villages can be settled over and not permanent until town or city connects it. Terrain distance? - Tundra villages can be settled more distantly, Jungle villages must be closer.

Towns Types- Trading Towns, Fort Towns and Amenity Towns. 

Towns can be build on or adjacent to villages. Look like Trading Post Civ 5 or Rural Cities with City Lights.

Trading Towns are main type. Founded by Traders (expending them). Better Connect/Increase Tile Range of nearby Yields of Villages worked by cities. Creates a local economy that generates gold and adds population that occasionally migrates to major cities. Can build specialistic buildings in towns and cities that interact with nearby resources and create tradable luxuries. Towns act as distant districts with buildings that improve yields of nearby resources.

Produced Luxuries: Furs are produced by having a settlement that works nearby Deer, Fox, Bison and Boar tiles and creating a Tannery @ Trapping. Some other resources and the buildings that help create the resource:

Weaver: Discovered at wheel + Production to Silk, Cotton, Hemp, Dyes Creates Wool from 3+ Sheep near the city/town.

Stable: Now Creates Dairy with 3+ Cattle

Lighthouse: Now Creates Lobster if 3+ Crab Resources.

Brewery: Medieval Tech/Civic +Gold to Coffee, Wine, Tea. Creates Brew from 3+ Apple or 3+ Wheat

Kiln -&gt; Porcelain With 3+ Clay, +Production Glass, Jade, Tobacco.

Apothecary -&gt; Wax/Tallow (same resource) from Honey, Whales and Wild Animals. Improves spices, perfumes and give additional food for working unimproved forest/jungle/grassland tiles.

Woodshop -&gt; Furniture with +2 Hardwood/ 4+ Lumbermills. Makes Paper Bonus Resource used by printing presses. Improves lumber mills and bonus resources Hardwood and Syrup.

Fort Towns: Bases that create territorial defensive buffers, patrol &amp; establish surveillance on roads &amp; waterways,  and promote troops/train generals &amp; admirals. May also act as armories for upgrading troops and research bases late game. Castles and Military Bases are the upgrades with wonder forts like Red Fort or Alhambra. Can be set up far outside territory for trade routes/foreign conquest/colonization, but need protecting soldier. Act as offensive start point for long distance invasion. Build by a builder for 3 charges. Mongolia gets Mobile Forts, Portugal gets Feitoria (Improved trade/colonization fort). 

Possible Arena/Mercenary/Builder/Toll Road specialization. Can spawn new unit built in nearby city in fort if held for 15 turns. 

Amenity Towns: Built by Scout unit line (close to territory). Adds Culture/Faith/Gold/Happiness/Tourism by creating towns that have attractions. Examples are Beach Towns, Ski Towns, and Nature Towns that have national parks/natural wonders/exotic protected species. Mid-Late game mechanic except for early natural wonder settles. Can have Wonders with unique terrain requirements built in the town.

Towns don‚Äôt effect happiness as much as cities and can be settled in niche/mostly barren locations. Can settle a city on town and pick up buildings/progress making towns like colonies. Not sure if towns should operate like mini cities or builders/trade routes build few key buildings. Civic choice. Also maybe at cultural threshold need to cross before planting a town/locality requirments

Cities will span/take up to 5 tiles as population increases (Towns up to 2). Only buildable ‚Äúdistricts‚Äù are harbor, and canal improvements.

Tall vs Wide: Tall can have more distance between cities filled by weaker towns extending tile range that support a high population city. Having high population grants early science building Academies and allows for dominant banks but much more need for Sewers (Production scales with city size), Aqueducts (Increase Higher Population Growth), Fire-stations (Prevent Fire Hazard) 

Wide is having less distant cities and fewer towns. More production/resources based economy. Military, Great Person, Culture and Faith focus, Lots of Resources vs Science Pushes balance based on era. Tall has options to colonize/develop banking/technology sectors to increase power. Tall can set up colonies to extract resources land lacks, buy mercenaries/vasal alliance and civic for volunteer army where expend population for soldiers. Wide can out Hammer/out build in eras with little tech lead advantages. 

Quick Why: Civ functions better with just non-district city tiles because of size of map grid. Settlements adds a way to build interactive landscape with historical accuracy (ancients traveling away from cities for mining/hunting and medieval towns specializing around local resources). Still have adjacency/specialization but have more aesthetic empires that are more interesting to fight through (aka explosion fighting thru oil town/fighting over forts/castles).

#Resource Changes

Trading towns utilize collections of resources. Reworking of resources such that Domesticated Animals can be moved to less farmable land like ranches. Forests can be regrown/chopped but not moved. Plantations can shift a tile or two on flatland. Meanwhile Farmland, Mines, Quarries, Coral are not movable. 

Wild Game must be hunted in a range. Ranges are recognized on map with highlights and at camps with 3 workable spots the population working the tile will roam the range and produce different food amounts periodically for 5 turns (1-6 food) based on hunting success. Success is based on technology/animal population/game bonuses but is always a bit random. Deer/Gazelle/Wild Horses/Whales can be found in huge ranges. Crabs/Beavers/Otters/Crocodiles have smaller ranges. Pollution, Poachers, Destruction of Habitat will lower hunting options. Late game wilderness protection options. Hunting adds happiness to cities, but may be less productive than ranches.

Addable Resources: At Renaissance can add an extra plantation of same type. Example Charleston has 2-3 cotton, can add 1 more cotton with new tech. 

In medieval Domesticated Animals like Pigs (from Boars) and Chicken (from Jungle) can be discovered by a civ and traded across world. Cows/Sheep cannot be traded (unless Bison/Boar resource nearby) and are improved by both Tannery/Weaver and Stable and produce Dairy/Wool. Pigs/Chicken can be traded and added adjacent to towns to help growth rate. Can add 1-2 Domesticated Animals to Towns at through mid game.

#Trade

Must Physically Connect to a civ with a trade route to trade luxuries and strategic resources. That is trade routes new function. Having Luxury Diversity and trade routes moving through your cities generates lots of gold, costs money to encourage trade routes (Forts, Patrols, Canals, Barge/Ferries, Harbors, Stability) and send trade routes. 

Early Game Mechanics:

1.) Scouting/Establishing Forts to build trade routes

Scouts now have two upgrades

 Rider- Horseback Riding (Extra movement, Can Retreat. Can also Carry/Transfer Movement to Traders/Builders/Weak Military Units, Requires Having Horse/Camel but does not use resource)

Explorer- Celestial Navigation (RiverBoat Mobility, Embark Mobility) 

After teching Celestial Navigation and Writing can trade Maps with other civilizations. (Change Cartography Tech to Compass)

These are to help discover landscape of cities and nomadic settlements (baby citystates). Trade routes are extended if a trade route passes through these. Want to encourage traders to go on routes through city with roads/waterways secured by forts and patrolling units. Traders will add gold to economies of cities they pass by and improve trails to roads with frequent use.

Forts are a settlement built by builders. Forts are the best way to extend trade routes in hostile areas no cities/nomadic settlements. But require military manpower if not close to territory. Can also gift Costal Trading Town settlement to another civ on coast to improve trade route. Maybe can set up a Classical Era Toll Road company for stabilizing barbarian heavy areas. 

Once a trade route is established can automatically trade with that civ. More Luxuries in game but less Happiness/Amenities per.

2.) Middleman Dynamics:

Middle-manning is the option to take duplicate luxuries from hard to reach civs and resell them in your city them with your local neighbors. Massively boosts your cities‚Äô economy. Automatic Option in Ancient/Classical for sending a trade route. Markets generate Great Merchant points enhanced by business flow through the city. Great Merchants in Medieval-Renaissance Era can craft exclusive trade deals which force duplicate resources in bad economy civs/city states to be renewed in their cities continuing this advantage.

3.) Trading Food/Discoveries

Can trade foods like Grains, Fruit and Meats for Food Diversity with Granaries, Grocers and Meat Packers. Food Diversity increase growth rate and adds Happiness. Luxuries like Salt, Honey, Spices increase Food Diversity. (Not like normal domestic food trades/food does not come from nowhere, but can generate extra food with diversity. 40 food + 10% food Diversity = +4 food from trade) *Can automate this with trade agreements. 

Technology: Certain Bonus Resources like Chicken, Pigs, Hunting Dogs, Soybeans, Messenger Pigeons will randomly get discovered by civs and can be traded across the world added to cities and towns. Advanced civs can give its ally inferior modernized weaponry to create militia men units in Renaissance/Industrial and Fighters in Modern Era.

Early Game Science is based more around Trade and Population than Libraries (more cultural/faith/Great Writer based).

4.) Interaction of Mechanics

Traders aren‚Äôt units on the map they are lines along city paths that occasionally differentiate if close in safety/utility. Civs have 1-3 main trade cities. Mainly their Capital and major costal trade cities on unique water bodies. You connect with the most convenient major trade city. If a barb or enemy civ camps a road/coast tile a trade route is on that trade route will cross randomly within 1 to 4 turns and may have a 10% chance to escape. If not the enemy unit kills the trader and takes gold/ 0-15 turns of part of the resource in return. The unit spawns in the capital after the luxury turns are up and will attempt another route. Escaping/Hearing about a destroyed trade route automatically relocates other caravans away from the area. Forts and Patrols can notice enemy units and warn traders and traders have a 30% chance to see a destroyed trader on route and warn/relocate. 

If a neighbor declares war you can usually trade in another direction. If its an aggressive war effort with blockades you can convert traders into smugglers (more expensive) who can attempt to sneak resources in/out of country. Smugglers also can trade banned/embargoed luxuries and plant illegal weaponry to allies/city states. 

Can freely convert between traders, cargo ships and smugglers. Land trade routes become less efficient at longer distances than sea trades. However Sea Trade Routes are easier to be blocked by enemies/Shipwreck events.

Quick Why: Trade seems useless in the game. Its possible and sometimes better to never send trade routes/secure borders. Adds Blockade/Trade Wars/Exploration Rewards and makes Trade Caravans/Markets/Harbors extremely useful.

# Economies


There are now 20 economies in the world based around buildings/resources that build wealth and production to their home country. Trade with different economies increases Luxury Diversity increasing Gold and some unique benefits. Some buildings like Stock Exchanges, Automobile Manufactories, Machinery Factories and Movie Industries are only available to those who reach certain levels of economic power in their countries. 

7 Luxury Based Industries. Add Production but mostly gold. Possible to trade one for one luxuries to better synergize industries.

Flavoring (4 Spices sorted by color (Chili/Saffron, Ginger/Mustard/Tumeric, Cinnamon/Nutmeg, Pepper/Cloves), Salt, Truffles)

Sweets (Cocoa, Citrus, Coconut, Sugar, Honey)

Garment (Tannery, Weaver)

Cosmetic(Dyes, Perfume, Olives, Coconut, Wax, Clay(BR), Coral, Whales)

Jewelry(Gold, Silver, Amber, Ivory, Gems, Jade, Coral)

Householdry (Furniture, Porcelain, Wax, Jade, Ivory, Glass, Incense)

Drug(Coffee, Tea, Wine, Brew, Tobacco, Hemp, Poppies)

-

5 Essential Industries 

Every nation builds these, but some become top corporations and get extra production benefits.

Construction(Stonework, Woodshop, Glass, later Iron/Metals)

Chemical (Rubber, Pyrites, Perfume)

Manufacturing(Tannery, Iron/metals, Coal, Synthetic Materials)

Grocery(Cereal, Fruit, Meat/Dairy, Fish)

Energy(Oil, Gas, Coal, Green Energy)

Construction and later Chemical + Manufacturing can trade production, Grocery can trade food with Granaries, Grocers and Meatpacking Factories. The better the Manufacturing/Chemical/Construction business the more production buildings you have the option to build. Like if I have a top 2-3 Manufacturer Industry I can build an automobile factory.

-

8 Developed Industries

Build by building/civic choices tend to be based around yields (science, gold, culture, loyalty, amenities, combat strength, mobility)

Entertainment(Theaters, Concerts, Sports)

Printing-&gt; Telecommunications (Printer/Broadcast Center)

Travel (Amenity Towns, Wonders, Art)

Technology(University/Public School/Research Lab + Stability/High Pop)

Pharmaceutical (Drug/Chemical/Hospital + Science Buildings)

Banking(High Pop Stability w/ lots of Trade, Mercantile Civics)

Mercenary-&gt; Military Complex (Military Buildings/Military Civics)

Transportation (Railroad, Airport, Delivery, Seaport, Barges, Canal, Toll Roads)

Start industries at techs/civics based around early buildings -&gt; Drug @ Alchemy (Late Classical) that is improved by building Apothecaries and Hospitals. If you own the best/most of the resources by land ownership or trade you have the chance to create a guild/corporation. You can name/ use preset non-copyright names for. 

4-5 Nationalistic Companies for each industry and 2-3 of these will top the industry. You can build headquarters, help build additional gold/production building. You can also have good trade networks/civics. For the Drug Industry I could build Headquarters, Labs and fulfill requests like adding a Patent Office, Taverns and a Drug Store section to Grocers. Can also set up your Drug industry in other allied/friendly civs and city states you support. Trade Agreements and Protections that develop. Corporations can grow huge and buy up smaller less developed corps in smaller companies. Creates need to get more resources for industry.

Problem: Any real life player would just try to collectively embargo/war you.

New mechanic: Updated Citystate system. Early game nomadic settlements appear across the map. Most die or get settled over but some(along with barbarian cities) can become citystates with 1-2 unique traits like Hong Kong, Singapore, Venice, Switzerland, Scotland, Belgium, Philippines, Texas, Tibet, Dubai, Zanzibar, Zimbabwe etc. Some city states defensive settlers can spawn from overcrowded high pop cities past Medieval and try to independently settle the world. 

These city states can grow multiple cities and will act as trade partners. Can help them industrialize if they house your Corporations. Even options to share technology/gold and have the attack players. Economic Victory is having developed loyal city-states that dominate the world funded by dominant nationalistic industries. Also mechanic to influence/win over city states even when at war. Adds Dual Economic/Science Victory for Tall Civs.",civ,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/pczjlw/creative_civ_7_ideas_settlements_trade_economies/,,FullNeanderthall,pczjlw,/r/civ/comments/pczjlw/creative_civ_7_ideas_settlements_trade_economies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/pczjlw/creative_civ_7_ideas_settlements_trade_economies/,0,2021-08-28
You can only know God by the spirit,Most of these people who claim to be Christians know nothing of God they only know about him from a book that was written. A book it was fashioned into the worlds biggest idol. That has ruled over millions of people since the 1600s. Most people think the Bible was sent to them by God. But God never sent a book he only sent the Holy Spirit to lead you and guide you in the truth and reconcile you back to the father to bring you home. But the homosexual king James had the help of Constantine a conqueror who killed hundreds of thousands of gods children. He stole the letters they wrote to one another and the ratings they had written down. And he compiled a book and he called it the word of God. King James authorized it published it with a few of his own edits I'm sure he didn't change much. And forced everyone to live under this rule it's no longer God in us but a book in our hands. That is what Christianity is today. A book in their hand and tons of scripture in their head for it is written they say. But where is the Holy Spirit in all of this well it's right in front of you it's in a book that's the Holy Spirit. For inspire these men to say these things. And to write them down. But the truth is this the Holy Spirit is not in the Bible now he inspired people to speak the truth and he does the same thing today and he changes people he brings them to Jesus Jesus gives them faith by speaking words to them how they shall live their lives. God comes to them speaks to them and move them. They submit to Jesus in the spirit and their hearts are cleaned. They are transformed they are new creatures they have died to the old nature within them. And they fight the good fight of faith. And the Bible worshipers of the world stand up and they say they're the real Christian because they know the word of God it's written down in a book not knowing that they only live by site. They have to have a GPS to find their way on the map. And their GPS is a Bible so when the Holy Spirit speaks something to them they quench the Spirit because they can't find it in the Bible so the Christians of today have created an image of God and an image of Jesus and that's who they live that's how they worship in their hearts. To repent as a gift given by God to a sincere heart. Jesus has shown me how he's picked the bottom of the barrel those that the world can never understand because the world is so educated and complicated that they cannot be helped because they know everything and they are perfect. But the few of us who truly know Jesus in the spirit and know God live after a life in the spirit another life after the flesh.,AtrueChristian,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtrueChristian/comments/pczo2x/you_can_only_know_god_by_the_spirit/,,Thick-Anywhere-9049,pczo2x,/r/AtrueChristian/comments/pczo2x/you_can_only_know_god_by_the_spirit/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtrueChristian/comments/pczo2x/you_can_only_know_god_by_the_spirit/,0,2021-08-28

F4M RP: The Old Man Next Door Takes The Neighborhood Milf,"In your old age you had come to be seen as someone rather harmless, trusting, perhaps even wise. People seemed to trust you, to truly respect you to some degree, especially after wife left you and it had become just you in your household. And while you did enjoy people stopping by to offer assistance if you required any or extra food, they had made you never really needed it. But much more of interest to you of all those people were your neighbors. They were a nice family, but more than that the wife‚Ä¶ she was kind, polite, hardworking but more importantly had the lewdest body you had ever laid eyes on. You couldn‚Äôt believe it the first time you saw her. Large round breasts that could almost always threaten to break a button on her button up collared shirt when she was going out for work, a thick round ass that almost always threatened to tear her pants if she ever bent over and to top it all off she had a nice pretty face with full soft lips that you knew would just feel amazing to kiss, or better yet, kiss your cock. It was nice to be so trusted as the kind old man next door, it helped you get all sorts of looks and glances you probably otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have gotten. Almost daily did she tease you with her mere existence. It had become almost routine for you to be up early on your porch not just to enjoy the morning air and sunrise but to witness her morning jogs. Her hair pulled back in a tight ponytail as she pranced around in her sports tank top and yoga pants. The way her body swayed and jiggled was almost always too much to bear. After politely returning her good morning greeting you would watch her jog away, thick cheeks clapping as the seam of her pants rode up her crack. You would sit there fantasizing until she went out of view before returning to your home and jerking off vigorously from the memory.  
  
Eventually though, it wasn‚Äôt enough to just have your thoughts and fantasies about that incredibly Milf. You needed more and by God you were going to get more if you could. So began a meticulous habit of snapping pictures and videos when you could, always out of view or while she was distracted. The mornings were easy to get material from. With her distracted with her morning workout routine, you could easily snap pictures when she turned her back or her focus on exerting her own body. You easily had time to zoom and take all the shots you wanted off her ass as she bent over for a stretch, her breasts bouncing and swaying back and forth with each movement, sweat even dampening her clothing as she rounded back down the road on the sidewalk, occasionally even she must have hurried and not put a bra on as you could make out the impression of her large nipples pressing against the fabric of her clothing. Over a few days you got some amazing fap material, but you knew you needed more, and you could get it. Kindly and politely, you invited the couple to your house for dinner and a swim in your pool. Of course, they accepted your offer and you felt so pleased with yourself because you would be able to see her in a bathing suit. They arrived on that day in the evening close to sundown. Partially disappointed she a loose-fitting dress of sorts on over her swimwear but it only made you hungrier for a true look at her body underneath. Time continued as you bated your time and waited for attention to be off you. Everyone sat down on your backyard patio. Idle chit-chatted was carried on as you acted as your normal kindly self, asking about work and family, wishing them all the best but it was in that conversation that you picked up a piece of information that made your ears perk up. Her husband mentioned that he had to leave for a business trip soon. Which would leave his wife home all alone by herself. While your mind hadn‚Äôt come up with an active plan yet you knew that it would be an opportunity to at the very least get so much more than you ever could have before.  
  
After that coasting conversation you stood up and said that the cooking should begin soon. Her husband was quick to offer that he be the one that cook the food on the grill, since you were so kind to invite them over for such a friendly get together. At that she stood up as well saying that she would enjoy the pool for a tiny bit. As you looked down at her, eyeing her clear cleavage she held her phone in her hands, checking it and somehow you were able to notice her passcode as she entered it quickly before she laid it down on the table. Your heart began to race as she said that she would take a dip and knew that now you could sneak some more material for your ever-growing collection of fap material of her. You moved hurriedly yet restrained into the house to get the foods for the grill and by the time you returned it took every ounce of will power to not immediately get noticeably hard at the sight in front of you. She had finally disrobed from her dress and now completely in her swimwear. Her bikini was something that belonged in some porno. Her top was so conservative with its material that it only just barely covered her nipples, in fact when she moved or turned you could start to see her areola‚Äôs peeking out from behind her top, and none of her breast size or form was left to the imagination. The bottoms for it weren‚Äôt anything worse either, small and seemed to only serve the purpose of just covering her holes, the thin fabric looped down just over her pussy and when she turned around you saw that her large ass had completely swallowed it, revealing it all in its glory. Your frustration mounted as you grew excited. It was no doubt for her husband as she probably didn‚Äôt consider you looking at her but you couldn‚Äôt help but feel like she was such a tease with her erotic body that belonged in some porn video online or modeling magazine. You couldn‚Äôt help but feel like such a lewd body was wasted on her husband entirely. You bit your lip as her husband took the food from you and turned away to begin his task and you reached for your phone and waited when she was no longer paying attention to you. You were able to get some good pictures from the ordeal of trying to play everything cool. Sadly, and to your dismay however her husband kept trying to strike up conversation with you as he went back and forth. And you missed a shot that would have become your trophy of all you had. When the food was nearly done, she had taken noticed and began to make her way to the ladder on the side of the pool and then began to climb out. Her back to you and her husband turned away you weren‚Äôt fast enough to capture it but you saw it completely and burned it into your brain. As she lifted her legs, arching her body forward as she climbed out of the water her cheeks spread from the motion and so clearly you were able to see as the fabric of her swimsuit, so thin in the back just barely covered her holes. The outline of her cute butthole peeked out from around it and the bottom rode up on her pushing against her pussy into an obvious impression and camel toe of it. It left almost nothing to the imagination but just hid enough to make you feel wild. The rest of the night you were almost in a daze trying your best to keep up appearances and not just tell them to leave so you could walk inside and jerk off. Finally‚Ä¶ the day completely closed, she redressed, and they both left, leaving lots of leftovers.  
  
You were furious as you tried to get off thinking back on the moments of the night. How dare she be so erotic and taunting. She needed a good fucking; her body was made for sex and cock. You thought hard about it and just as you were about to finish a thought leapt into your mind, piecing together all the things you‚Äôve experienced that night. She would be all alone for a week soon. You knew how to get into her phone too and‚Ä¶ you needed a new wife. You came hard as the thought planted itself into your head and a devious plan started to form.  
  
You had marked the date in your calendar and waited for what felt like an eternity despite it only being a few days. You watched out your window as that lewd Milf‚Äôs husband had left. Now was time to get your plan into motion. Today you didn‚Äôt sit outside in the morning to watch your neighbor‚Äôs morning job instead you sat in the window and sorted out the details in your mind. You waited painfully all day, keeping yourself on edge until you watched her return from work. At that point you exited your house and waved in a loud greeting to get her attention. ‚ÄúHey! I just remembered your husband was leaving for awhile.‚Äù You lied through your teeth. ‚ÄúI still have extra leftovers and I was thinking that since you‚Äôre so tired from work I‚Äôd offer you to eat at my place for tonight to help lighten the load before you head off to bed. Easier than cooking something right?‚Äù She locked her car and thought hard for a moment before gazing at you. She sized you up and then nodded with a smile. ‚ÄúThank you so much.‚Äù She said kindly. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll take you up on that offer if I‚Äôm not imposing.‚Äù She returned her kind smile and then led her back to your front door. She underestimated you, she couldn‚Äôt comprehend your intentions, always thinking you to be the kindly old man next door. She would be proven wrong tonight. You, like a true kind old man allowed her in the door first then walked in after her smiling to yourself as you locked the door behind you.  
  
You acted as if nothing was wrong or weird, just as you always would but kept your goal at the forefront of your mind reheating food and subtly offering her a glass of wine. ‚ÄúNothing like a good glass of red to end the day.‚Äù You explained keeping up the fa√ßade. Feeling as though it would be rude to do otherwise she accepted as you chatted back and forth. One glass, two glass, three glasses in and a long day of work behind her you noticed how sleepy faced she seemed to get. Multiple times after she tried to excuse herself and yet you always were able to cut off that approach eventually leading her to the living room to continue your ‚Äúconversation‚Äù. You kept switching topics never really letting her get a word in until as you continued to talk you noticed that her eyes had closed and she was fast asleep, no doubt having been exhausted and relaxed. A devious smile crept on your face as you began to set up your work. A camera facing her, scissors in hand you approached her carefully, pinching the fabric on her nipples and pulling her on it before snipping it off. Her shirt ruined but you completely opened up her nipples to your gaze. You lick your lips already tempted to suck and play and tease with them but you hold off until all preparations were complete. Carefully you laid her onto the couch, her body near limp as you pull up her skirt and expose her pantyhose, a clear thong hugging her hips underneath. What a slutty bitch you thought as you cut it up and then snipped the fabric of the thong. Finally her bare ass was completely open and available to you. You couldn‚Äôt help yourself as your hands gripped and squeezed her cheeks, your fingers sinking into the thick flesh as your thumbs spread them wide and a quiet groan came from her. There before your very eyes was her holes. Her cute little butthole twitching and squeezing subconsciously from your teasing and her pussy near quivering under your hands. Pursing your lips you let down a glop of spit onto her asshole, your thumb carefully moving in to rub it in and down over he pussy. This was it; this was your moment.  
  
You adjusted yourself on the couch, your long thick cock and heavy balls throbbing just above her ass. You had been anticipating this moment for so long. You pressed your thumb against her small hole, pushing against it until the muscles gave way. At that moment, the moment your thumb sunk into her butthole her upper body shot up as she moaned loudly and so lewdly. It was then that you pounced. You jumped forward pinning her down as your thumb sunk all the way into her ass and gripped her face with your other hand covering her open mouth as she moaned. ‚ÄúFinally awake?‚Äù You asked coyly as you began to pump your finger in and out of her hole. Just such a simple act reaffirmed your desire and mindset that she was the perfect woman as she moaned repeatedly against your hand. Her own hands reached up and grasped yours on her face but almost as if grabbing a cat by their tail she seemed helpless, like a deer in headlights. The sounds she made against your hand told you that she was trying to make sense of the situation, to question what you were doing. There was no need to even ask as you planned to express everything to her in the end. Your cock throbbed and prodded against her ass, teasing her with what you were about to do. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been watching you for some time.‚Äù You said slowly removing your thumb from her tight hole and reaching forward to grab one of her arms and pin it behind her back. You thick and long cock pressed downward as you replaced the pressure on her hole with the tip of your dick, pushing and teasing her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been teasing me for so long with such an erotic body and I‚Äôve decided to make you apologize to my dick for tormenting it so much.‚Äù The moment you said that last word you pushed your hips down sinking your cock deep into her hole. You felt her tongue press against your hand as her eyes rolled back from the simple act of making her take your cock. You groaned heavy unable to stop yourself as you began to thrust harder and harder, your heavy balls clapping against her ass. You felt her muscles squeeze and milk your cock as you pushed it down to the base and pulled out to just the tip and repeated the process. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to punish you thoroughly!‚Äù  
  
Only a short time later you pinned her to the floor, your body mounting and encircling hers as you restrained her in a tight mating press, not letting her move or get away. Your hips piston thrust with more life than you had felt in years while your mouth latched on and sucked hard on her large nipples, pulling and stretching them as you roughly teased them. ‚ÄúOOoh Pleassee Ahh St-TOP AHH!‚Äù She begged, moaning at the depth of each of your thrusts but her pussy was squeezing and clamping down on your raging member while your first load oozed from her. The camera you had set up captured it all, every detail of her large round ass pinned to the floor, her pussy completely stretched by your thick and long cock as you pulled to the tip and thrust all the way back in rapidly showing just how much she was taking. Her face was distorted so lewdly as her mouth was gaped, tongue lulling out and her eyes rolled back. Her voice was loud with moans and pleas. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided to make you my new wife!‚Äù You groaned as you slammed down hard against her ass, clapping her cheeks with your balls. ‚ÄúNhOooo!‚Äù She cried out in a moan. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm maaArrried!‚Äù You tsked with authority. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs no good, if you keep acting like that I‚Äôll have to train you properly until you become my cockwife!‚Äù And with that declaration you slammed your hips down, pushing as deep into her womb as you could and unloaded yet another thick and gooey warm load. She moaned loud and hoarse again.  
  
Unrelenting, after that you had pulled her into your bedroom. You pushed her forward, hands bound behind her back while your fingers hooked her cheeks and played with her tongue keeping her from talking back to you. You kept her steps in pace with yours which kept her body pressed against you, your still throbbing cock mashed tightly between her thick ass cheeks so that with each step she stroked your dick and rubbed all your excess cum over it ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be my bitch from now on and that pesky husband of yours won‚Äôt get in my way. I‚Äôm going to break you and make you mine by the time he comes back.‚Äù You introduced her to her new bed with a camera already set up in the room. You had ripped off and discarded the rest of her clothing now. She was completely naked and you used the scraps of her slutty underwear to bind her hands by her wrists behind her back. You laid comfortably on the bed, made her crouch on her knees between her legs with her back arched and her thick ass pointed out towards the camera you set up. Both of her holes oozed your spunk. One of your hands rested on her head making sure she properly sucked your cock with deep long strokes, while the other went through her phone, replying to a goodnight message from her husband to avoid any sort of suspicion, then you switched to the camera and pointed it down at her slutty face. Her soft round lips pursed around your shaft, tears and spit coating her face and smearing her makeup from the effort of taking it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry I won‚Äôt send anything to your husband right now if you do a good job. But we can give him all the footage I‚Äôll have of you submitting to me when you leave him, Oh and don‚Äôt worry about your clothes, you‚Äôll be staying here from now on, so you won‚Äôt need them‚Äù She groaned in response, probably some sort of protest but all it served to do was make her tongue vibrate on the underside of your cock. ‚ÄúI hope you enjoyed that last meal because I‚Äôll be changing you to a strict new diet. I read online somewhere that the more cum you put into a woman the more submissive and obedient she becomes."" You smile with another deep groan as you pushed her head down, making her kiss the base of your cock and pumped rope after rope of thick spunk into her throat, clearly more than she could handle as she coughed, her cheeks starting to bulge while her eyes rolled back as some of your cum began to ooze from her nostrils and around her lips. You sighed loudly in relief, holding down her head to make sure she took every drop of your sperm. ‚ÄúYour body was made for my cock, and I won‚Äôt stop until I‚Äôve made you my exclusive wife and cumdump. Now hurry up and swallow all of it, your slutty face makes me want to cum all over it. You‚Äôre going to use that mouth on your new husband‚Äôs balls next and I want a picture of my cock on your face to commemorate the start of your submission to me.‚Äù  
  
// Wow that‚Äôs a long one! This is a slight departure from what I normally write, but this is something I have been thinking about for a long time, so I sort of just put it all out there!

I don't know how to deal with my mom in stressful situations,"Hi,

I'm not even sure I'm even in the right subreddit, but I'm not sure how to handle this anymore. 

I'm 21F and my mom was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 5. Before she was officially diagnosed and taking medications, she used to yell at me, hit me, and lock herself in a room which left 4 year old me wandering around the house and completely alone until my dad would come home. If I did anything wrong or angered her in any way(nothing serious, just little kid stuff. I was a very calm kid), she used to threaten me with ""wait until your dad gets home and hears about this. He's going to be SO mad at you. just wait"". Now I realize lots of parents say this, but when you're only 4 and someone's screaming that in your face it's scary. I used to get so scared I would be anxious until my dad would get home. She did this so much that from then on, that I've always been on high alert when my dad would come home and I would be so anxious that I would either leave the room or be aggravated when my dad would get home and just say hi to me. He never got mad at me or anything but those emotions have stayed with me until now. I just recently transferred to university and moved out. 

She started taking medications when I was 5 or 6 and they've been working very well for her. The issue comes when we're in stressful situations. We were getting on a short flight a few years ago and she started feeling sick. She threw up, then it was like..she dissociated. I don't think that's the word but it's like her normal adult self stepped out of her body and a kid took over. She started frantically pacing, had no idea what she was saying, and she was just all over the place all panicked. She's not someone who's afraid of flying. Or when I'm driving and we get somewhere with lots of traffic or another driver does something wrong, she loses it. She doesn't drive, so I'm always driving when this happens. When it comes time to navigate a more difficult road or literally any minor inconvenience, she won't let me, as the driver, focus on what I'm doing. She'll talk my ear off right at that moment and just go ""oh my god, oh my god"" over and over again. Her nervousness makes me nervous and I lose control when I'm normally a very calm driver. If something happens on the side of the road that has nothing to do with my lane, she'll start screaming at the other driver inside our car. It's driving me crazy. It's like she's trying to give me instructions on how to drive when she doesn't drive herself. It's extremely difficult to drive when someone's next to you going ""oh my god"" and attempting to give you instructions as if it's your first time on the road. 

I'm just so frustrated. I'm a premed student and my major has a lot to do with psych. I've never read about any behavior like this. I've worked at a hospital, so I know how to calm down an anxious person, but it doesn't work with her and honestly, I don't have time to calm someone down when I'm driving and they're screaming in my ear. I'm honestly not trying to talk bad about her. My mom has done so much for me. I love her and we're very close, but I don't know how to handle these behaviors. Traveling is just so hard with her because I have to figure out the whole airport situation while trying to take care of her. It's too much for me and I just wanna cry. Please let me know if you know anyone like this or what I can do.",depression,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pczwtj/i_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_mom_in_stressful/,,Glittering-Bat6424,pczwtj,/r/depression/comments/pczwtj/i_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_mom_in_stressful/,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pczwtj/i_dont_know_how_to_deal_with_my_mom_in_stressful/,0,2021-08-28

Competition," When I'm cross-dressed and submissive, I am all about getting cock. When a guy tells me who to fuck or how, when I'm given to someone I didn't choose, especially if I wouldn't choose them, that's the best.

I met a dom on craigslist and he had me come to his place in the suburbs. My instructions were to park in the driveway in front of the house and to be dressed as a slut when I got out of the car and went to the door. That told me a lot about him and was definitely an exciting way to start, particularly as we were meeting midday.

I got out of the car dressed in my short skirt, black stockings, heels, panties, and a dress shirt and rang the door bell. It seemed like a long wait standing there in the wide open. Finally the door opened. A fit looking 50ish guy with long stringy hair and a goatee stood there. He checked me out without saying anything and then walked away leaving the door open.

I stepped inside. There were stairs going up to the living room and stairs going down to the basement. At the bottom of the stairs, a large chocolate mastiff was lying down, blocking the steps, and looking up at me disinterestedly. I was immediately in love. I'd never fucked a dog but I wanted that dogs cock. I hope that I might get it if I played my cards right.

The dom called me upstairs where he was seated in an easy chair. He had me stand in front of him and he inspected me in various poses. After a full inspection, he said he wanted to see what I could handle. He slapped my face and spit on me. He used nipple clips and then alligator clips on my tits and then slapped them off me. He wrapped my balls with a leather shoelace. He slapped my ass and my then body with a tawse, although he never seemed to hit me with much force.

Then whacked me forcefully with a cane. I don't recall the exact order, which I think was important, but he seemed very professional with the cane, varying intensity, location, interval with great effect. Hard whacks followed by tabs. Ass and then thighs and then breasts, but mostly the ass. Isolated whacks and then several in succession. I was whimpering with pain and hoping it would never stop. Eventually I broke down into tears at the pain. He pushed the cane gently against my lips and told me to kiss it, which I did. Then he sat down.

He told me to kneel in front of him and he pulled out a beautiful dick, probably 10"" and thick and shaped like a bat. I took it into my mouth with gusto and sucked it long and hard. As my mouth began to tire, he put both his hands overtop one another on the back of my head and pushed down with a lot of force. I gagged and gasped and struggled, my hands and legs flailing until eventually he came in my throat.

As I gasped for breath recovering, he sent me down the hall to the bedroom. I lay on the bed for a few minutes alone beside a variety of toys. He came in and unceremoniously lifted my legs and spread my knees. He fucked me with all variety of toys for about half an hour culminating in a big latex dildo that had me quivering in fear. I was sure it wouldn't go in my ass and would wreck me if it did, but I said nothing and took it. By the time he had forced it in I was in tears again but remained quiet and compliant. He didn't fuck me with it long, only until he could slide its length in and out of me with ease. Then he fucked me with his cock, came in my ass and told me I could leave. He was brilliant and I wanted to be his.

He allowed me to come over again about three weeks later. When I got to his place, without any warning to me there was another guy there. The third guy was about 20 years older than me and a full sissy. I always go pretty simple with my cross dressing, kind of a less is more approach with simple stockings, heels, skirts, and camis. This guy was all bustiered, gartered, and stillettoed with ribbons and shiny, sparkly stockings.

Thing is, I don't get turned on by sissies like me. I felt no arousal about this other guy. But I know my role and I knew that I had to accept that.

The dom set it up so we were competing for him. He examined us, had us pose and do small tasks. Then he had us whip each other. The other guy was thrilled with this, quite over dramatic if you ask me. I held back in whipping him but he played it up. When it was his turn to whip me, he had no control. When he managed to land a couple of hard ones, he crossed them, opening up a good welt on my butt. I took it stoically.

Then we were made to 69. I knew I was going to win this one because I don't care about having my dick sucked and the other guy was totally amped up. He barely got me hard before I had him shouting out an orgasm.

The dom sent me to the bedroom. He sent the other guy home and I got another awesome fucking. After that, he didn't respond to my messages and I never saw the dog again.",u_FarMeasurement1,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FarMeasurement1/comments/pcz9mx/competition/,,FarMeasurement1,pcz9mx,/r/u_FarMeasurement1/comments/pcz9mx/competition/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FarMeasurement1/comments/pcz9mx/competition/,0,2021-08-28

White Figures In The Field...,"Where I work is in the middle of nowhere. It's smack dab between a massive field, corn and the highway. Two factories, one trucking company and a place to rent farming equipment are the only buildings around. Then nothing for miles. Sometimes you can see car lights going by on the highway at night pass the over grown field. I always wondered why they didn‚Äôt just use the empty field for a corn field. The factory I worked at was huge so I understood the reasoning putting it in the middle of no man‚Äôs land because it wouldn‚Äôt fit anywhere else. 

To get to my job I need to drive straight down a road for five minutes passing by the empty field. People tend to speed down that stretch even though the road really needs to be repatched and small pot holes filled in. You would think after two years of having to drive that route I would know each bump and hole to avoid but I still hit them. 

Driving down the road in the pitch-black night I made the rookie mistake of lifted my coffee cup from the holder trying to drink it when I hit a bump and spilled the drink over my lap.  

‚ÄúOh perfect...‚Äù I said to myself in the dark car slowing down. 

I put the coffee back into the cup holder and stopped at the end of the road. You could only turn left towards the factories and other buildings. Turning right drove you into the field. In front of me was a large concert block keeping people from driving off the road, and another one the right but enough space to fit a small car through if for whatever reason you did want to go into that endless grass.  

While I was stopped, I got myself cleaned up as much as possible. It was factory work and I really didn‚Äôt care about my appearance. Satisfied I tried starting my car up again and, nothing. My head lights still on but car refusing to start back up. I was confused. I‚Äôve never had any issues or signs of trouble with this car. Not even a check engine light. I tried the ignition again thinking I just didn‚Äôt press it down hard enough. The worst case scenario is I get my car towed after my shift and ask my brother for a ride home. He wouldn‚Äôt be happy waking up early to come and get me after my midnight shift, but he owed me. 

The radio was still one. A sudden burst of static from it made me jump. That wasn‚Äôt anything unusual. The road was a dead zone. The radio dropped out all the time, or different station would bleed over the one I had it dialed too. I also could never get a signal out here and my car dropped the connection to my phone all the time making it impossible to have it read my messages until I got closer to the highway. So, when the radio screamed of static and what sounded like faint voices, I wasn‚Äôt scared. I turned it off, trying to start the car for a third time.  

I did get scared when I looked up, staring off into the field beyond. 

‚ÄúWhat in the world...?‚Äù  

My own voice sounding low and trembling. The full moon giving me enough light to see beyond what my headlights was illuminating. A mist covered the massive field to my right. Inside that mist, a figure rose from the ground. It looked like a person with long white hair, dressed entirely in white just, standing up from the mist. My brain gave me anything it could to write this off as normal. People liked to walk their dogs in the grass. Maybe I didn‚Äôt see them until now? That must be it. Something like that.  

I almost believed it until I saw more shapes rise up from the mist. All pure white and faintly glowing. Their forms flickering in the dark. I had just enough of that. Reaching for my door I was just going to run the entire way to my job and get someone to check this out. They can see what the hell this was all about. I would stay safely inside the building. Pushing on the door after lifting the handle, it didn‚Äôt move. 

The figures in the field started to move forward on unseen staggering feet, and my damn door was stuck. It wasn‚Äôt locked. I flicked the lock and unlock switch a dozen times. It didn‚Äôt budge. I tried the button for my windows, but nothing happened. In a panic I reach over to the other door, finding it unlocked but stuck as well. I didn‚Äôt understand it. First the car stops running and then the locks and windows refuse to move. It didn‚Äôt make any sense. The car was new and shouldn‚Äôt be having these issues. My brain didn‚Äôt want to think that those white figures slowly coming my way could be involved.  

The radio flickered back on causing me to let out a yelp of fear. I knocked the rest of my coffee from the holder darting back into the driver‚Äôs seat. Through the static I could hear a song. I couldn‚Äôt hear the words inside the music no matter how hard I listened. I didn‚Äôt even know what language was being sung inside that melody mixed between crackles of the radio.  

Looking up I saw one of the flickering white figures fairly close to my car. Hair over their face, it kept walking forwards. The mist traveled with it, hiding it‚Äôs footsteps. Beyond in the field more started to appear. 

My throat closed when I realized in a short few seconds I was looking at a mob of them. Not the four or five before I tried the doors and windows. I reach for my phone, and wasn‚Äôt even surprised to get no signal. I raised it to take a photo of the things in the mist in case I died I wanted my brother to have proof of the supernatural creature that killed me. So far, they hadn‚Äôt even looked my way but I wasn‚Äôt trusting them to be friendly. The photos I took turned out completely black and I groaned. 

I ran through my head desperately trying to figure out what I was going to do. I finally decided I was going to break my windows to get out of my car. The emergency kit in the back seat was just a liter of water and a jacket in case I was stranded in the snow. I foolishly did not buy something that cracks the windows in case of an accident and you need out fast. If I got through that night, I swore I would be more prepared in the future and buy a real emergency kit. 

Wrapping my fist in the jacket from the back seat, I steadied myself and punched the window. Pain traveled through my knuckles all the way to my teeth. It sucked. The window looked perfectly fine so I braced myself to hit it again. No matter how hard I punched at it with my fist and elbow, I didn‚Äôt even scratch my window. I sat, arm throbbing and still stuck inside my car with more white figures drifting by.  

I stopped trying to escape to try and recover a little. My arm hurt too much to keep going and I didn‚Äôt want to hurt my other one for no reason. Even if I could get out of my car, then what? Those figures were now everywhere. Standing up in the field and slowly making their way forward, down the road towards the factories. I squinted in the mist trying to see the lights of the buildings or the highway and saw nothing but that sudden thick fog. I was all alone trapped inside my car with these strange ghostly things. 

A loud crackle from the radio made me jump again. I reach over trying to silence it. No matter what I did, it was the same with the car door. It just wasn‚Äôt turning off or acting logically. Fear shot up into my throat when I saw a white figure turn a head towards the car. Long pale hair covered it‚Äôs face but I knew it heard the radio and it started to come towards the car. When it passed other figures, they changed their path, following it.  

These things now were aware of me and there wasn‚Äôt a damn thing I could do about it. I turned the radio knob praying it might get to a different station that wasn‚Äôt all static.  

This had to be a nightmare. That was it, a nightmare. Things like this just doesn‚Äôt happen.  

‚Äúj...oi...us.....‚Äù 

Words came through the static. Jumbled and most of the sound dropped. It became stronger and stronger, one phrase coming through the crackling radio.  

‚Äúj...ion.... us... Join... us...joi... u...‚Äù 

Looking up I saw one of the pale things were just in front of my car, just standing there head down and face covered. I started to punch my window again in a desperate attempt to get free, sore arm be damned. I didn‚Äôt even wrap my hand in my jacket I was so scared.  I just needed to be out of that car.  

One figure stopped beside the passenger window and bent down to look inside. I couldn't make out features through it‚Äôs hair but the fact it was now actively looking at me put me in a panicked fury. It reached a hand out, and to my sheer horror that hand slowly started to come through the solid window, the image rippling as if it was made of water. It looked like pushing a hand through took some effort and I had a few seconds before it reached me. Still, I fought trying to get out, panic taking over any kind of rational thought. 

It pushed through one arm first. Then it‚Äôs head. Another arm came through and it braced it‚Äôs hands against the inside of the door to try and push its body the rest of the way through. All while that horrible static kept getting louder and louder. I was is focused on that figure I wasn‚Äôt even aware of the one on the driver side window until it was too late. 

Icy cold hands grabbed at me. So cold it felt like they were burning through my uniform. I screamed until I just couldn‚Äôt scream any more. It pulled it‚Äôs hands away, taking something with it. My arm stayed, but something white came from my skin. The figure kept a grip on it, trying to pry out whatever the white mist was from my body. I felt so cold, my muscles freezing up. I pulled back my strength fading. I didn‚Äôt know what was happening but I knew if it fully pulled that white form from me, it would be all over.  

The moment before I exhausted all my willpower I was snapped forward and heard an ear shattering crunching and twisting sound. My car was thrown forwards, back spinning out of control. I blacked out from the impact of something hitting my car from behind. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure of how long I was passed out for. When I woke up, head spinning and, in such immense amount of pain, I thought I was dying, a co-worker was yelling at me through a shattered window. Blood dripped down my face. I could barely keep my eyes open. Still, I looked around to see no mist, or no white figures walking around. Listening to my co-worker try and tell me that help is on the way I drifted back off into the darkness. 

I woke back up a few days later in the hospital. I had a few things broken but I was alive. Cops came in to ask me what happened on my side, and explained what they knew. My car was stopped on that dark road with none of my lights on.  My co-worker was flying down the bumpy rough road, driving highway speeds. According to him, he saw me far too late and slammed into my car sending it into a few spins. No one understood why my air bag didn‚Äôt go off or why I was even stopped in the first place. Being tired and knowing no one would believe me about the figures, I lied and said I didn‚Äôt remember. From how hard I slammed my head against the steering wheel, they took it as a valid answer. 

My co-worker felt so terrible about nearly killing me, but I forgive him right away as long as he drove slower on dark roads at night. I‚Äôve haven‚Äôt figured out what happened to me on that field of what those figures were. And honestly, I don‚Äôt want to know. After I recover, I‚Äôm going to find a job in the city where most streets are lit up at night time.",nosleep,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pd10wa/white_figures_in_the_field/,,02321,pd10wa,/r/nosleep/comments/pd10wa/white_figures_in_the_field/,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pd10wa/white_figures_in_the_field/,0,2021-08-28

Week 0/1 Test,"#Week 0/1:  
##**Preview:**  

This section will be my thoughts before I watch the games. These will generally include predictions and my initial feelings about each team. This first week will probably be a bit slim since I don‚Äôt know much about the full states of these teams this season and I‚Äôll try to fill them out with more stats and narratives that I‚Äôm looking out for as the weeks progress.  

###***Nebraska at Illinois (1:00)***  

The inaugural game of the FBS season. No way I‚Äôm skipping this no matter who is playing. These are two programs that seem at about the same position at this point. They both have some solid history that involves winning, but that‚Äôs in the distant past. Now they are struggling at the middle to bottom of the B1G and seem to be in desperate search for a head coach that can bring their programs up to snuff to contend with the top and Ohio State. Illinois will be starting a new head coach in Bielema who has a pretty solid record as both a HC and an assistant with other programs while Frost will be fighting for his job in Nebraska. I think it will take time for Illinois to implement their system so Nebraska *should* win this one.  

My Prediction: Nebraska wins  

###***Hawai‚Äôi at UCLA (3:30)***  

This is a really fun matchup early that could get spicy. Hawai‚Äôi is a team I rarely get to watch because of when they play, so I am excited to finally get a good chance to watch them play. UCLA should be a solid middle class team in the PAC 12 bringing in a pretty good defense that should be enough to win some games. I‚Äôm not confident about their offense, but it should be a good game for them to show it off a bit. Hawai‚Äôi isn‚Äôt supposed to be the offensive powerhouse they typically are, but will also have a solid defense to rely on. I think this may be a low scoring game where UCLA‚Äôs improved offense wins it for them. But who knows, I‚Äôm not super solid on either team which is why I love this idea to get me invested in watching them.  

My Prediction: UCLA wins   

###***Southern Utah at San Jose State (10:00)***  

I know nearly nothing about either team, but I do know SJSU will be coming off of a great season and my hope is that I can follow them along as they look to make this season an even better one. I am excited to start this journey with them and I think this should be a pretty one sided affair. Which hopefully means I can start my experience following this team with an explosive, hypefest of a game to get me over the moon on this team‚Äôs potential. I also think they have one of the coolest logos in CFB/sports in general which is a big bonus.  

My Prediction: San Jose State wins  

###***UAB vs Jacksonville State (Wed, 7:30)***  

This game being on a Wednesday is both great and a tragedy. This game might be one of the most fun of the opening weekend. Both programs seem to have one of their best teams they‚Äôve ever assembled. The COVID year mixed with solid recruiting has these programs with more depth and talent than they would normally have at their disposal. UAB is one of my favorites to maybe sneak into the top 25 by the end of the year, but Jacksonville State may have something to say about that. I‚Äôm thinking this will be a very close game based on everything I‚Äôve read.  

My Prediction: UAB wins  

###***USF at NC State (Thu, 7:30)***  

Expected to be one of the more one-sided matchups, but NC State is my alma mater so I will be covering them every week. I don‚Äôt think this will be as clean of a win as the 18 point spread would have you think. NC State has some good potential but USF is looking like a much improved program this year. Perhaps not quite good enough to contend for the AAC, but good enough that I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be scraping the bottom either.   

My Prediction: NC State wins   

###***UNC at VT (Fri, 6:00)***  

A great matchup to start the season, UNC and VT are both looking to contend for the top of Coastal. This being in Blacksburg should make for a very tense and exciting match. The thing I‚Äôll be most excited to see is how UNC replaces its lost production. Some pretty heavy losses on the offense mixed with a few holes on defense means they will be pretty reliant on veterans in the trenches, Howell‚Äôs arm, and the new talent they brought in. If those three things show up in blacksburg, they could easily dominate their division.   

My Prediction: UNC wins  

###***Michigan State at Northwestern (Fri, 9:00)***  

I think this will be a really good test for both programs to gauge where they are. Northwestern is clearly looking to turn a phenomenal season into prolonged success at a level that contends for B1G championships. Michigan State is looking to turn around a program which has trended in the wrong direction recently. Mel Tucker didn‚Äôt get much of a chance to prove himself with the covid restrictions last year, so maybe a full offseason is enough for us to finally start gauging if he is a solution or just a placeholder until someone who can return MSU to prominence comes around.   

My Prediction: Northwestern wins   

###***Penn State at Wisconsin (12:00)***  

Was Penn State‚Äôs start last season just a bad fluke caused by COVID protocols and restrictions? That‚Äôs what they‚Äôll be looking to prove this time out. They have a really good early opportunity to take a big win against a high level conference foe. Meanwhile, Wisconsin similarly had a disappointing season that they will want to chalk up to COVID issues as well. Both teams have a good chance to take a big win early in this game and it will be interesting to see where these programs end up by the time the season is up.  

My Prediction: Wisconsin wins   

###***Stanford vs Kansas State (12:00)***  

Another really good way to mark where the two involved programs will be this season. Stanford has some unknowns on offense that they‚Äôll get a chance to find out more about. Meanwhile Kansas State had a really deceptive record last year. At their best, with their starting QB healthy, they could have had the chance at the Big 12 title, but when he went out so did any hopes of a good season. The questions this game revolve around the QBs: can KSU‚Äôs return to form and what does Stanford have in their new one?  

My Prediction: Kansas State wins   

###***Alabama vs Miami (3:30)***  

I think this matchup is being inaccurately evaluated. Miami, if King returns at a similar level as when he went down, could be setting up for a shocking upset. Their defense was disastrous last season, especially at the end. But they should be improved overall with new additions and some more time in the offseason. Alabama on the other hand needs to replace a ton, including a phenomenal QB and a Heisman winning WR, a rarity in the college world. Alabama likely does have the talent in the wings to make this transition smoothly, but I do think Miami could keep this game interesting if they can get a few hits in before Bama has settled in.   

My Prediction: Alabama wins   

###***Indiana at Iowa (3:30)***  

Indiana and Iowa will both be really strong teams this year, each with a chance to take their division and some pretty strong tests along the way. I think the biggest thing in each of their ways will be the tough schedules they face. Their OOC games are no cakewalk for either side and their conference slates are not easier. Iowa might have more opportunities to get wins but Indiana has a chance to get some truly great wins that could propel them into the CFP in spite of a potential loss to Ohio State.  

My Prediction: Indiana wins   

###***Louisiana at Texas (4:30)***  
		
I think this game will largely be overshadowed by the whole ‚ÄúTexas back‚Äù narrative no matter the outcome. I just feel like the media will use it as a way to call Texas overrated if they lose or say they‚Äôre back if they win. Either way, ignoring how great this Louisiana team was last year and should be again this year. I‚Äôll primarily focus on two things when watching this game: does Louisiana have the ability to contend when they are at a pretty extreme talent disadvantage and how has Texas evolved under new leadership? For Louisiana this could easily be the team with the most raw talent they‚Äôve faced in the past year, so can they use superior coaching and experience to win or has Texas finally found their HC that will know how to use the resources and talent of the program to their fullest.  

My Prediction: Texas wins   

###***San Jose State at USC (5:00)***  
				
As I said, I am excited to follow SJSU this year and this is one of their best opponents on the schedule. Like I said with Louisiana, the question is if they can keep up with USC‚Äôs talent. Granted, USC is generally better coached than Texas has been recently and is a more well-rounded program in general that should be able to take this game handily. But maybe SJSU can utilize their talent and experience to pull out a huge upset of a team that should be looking to contend for the PAC 12 title.  

My Prediction: USC win   

###***Texas Tech vs Houston (7:00)***  

This game has some pretty serious upset potential in my eyes. I could be dead wrong, but Houston is a team I expect to contend at the top of the AAC. I have them sitting right behind Cincy in the conference so a team like Texas Tech should be a good test, but also a win for them if the AAC is legitimate this year. Texas Tech returns a lot on the defense that could set them up for a solid season, but likely will not be fighting for the Big 12 title.  

My Prediction: Houston wins   

###***Georgia vs Clemson (7:30)***  

This game is the one everyone will be talking about leading into it. For good reason, but I don‚Äôt agree with some of the more popular takes about how it will shake out. Georgia should be a much more experienced team with the usual metric tons of talent. Clemson is replacing two of their best offensive players in the school‚Äôs history with production that will not be easy to replicate. It seems like Clemson has a much more daunting task than is being proposed and I think Georgia will win this one handily.   

My Prediction: Georgia wins   

###***LSU at UCLA (8:30)***  

A game with no previous matchups... that‚Äôs actually somewhat crazy considering I‚Äôve largely thought of these programs as being their conference‚Äôs football equivalents. Decent funding, good to great recruits, and most importantly: occasionally the best in their respective conferences, but normally playing somewhere in the range of 2nd or 3rd fiddle behind someone more dominant. Either way, this game should be a real treat to watch with UCLA trying to get on the right track with Chip Kelly and LSU trying to turn the page on a very disappointing season. I think LSU will take home a fairly decisive win if they can utilize their talent to its fullest and Orgeron can right the ship. If not, perhaps the expected improvements on the UCLA offense mixed with a strong defense can show UCLA has higher ambitions this season than a middling finish in the PAC 12.  

My Prediction: LSU wins   

###***Nevada at California (10:30)***  

Cal is a team that has a pretty solid history, but not much recent success. They suffered a pretty bad season last time out and will hope that a full offseason was enough to bridge the gap between them and their competition. Meanwhile, I don‚Äôt know much about Nevada but I am excited to watch Nevada this season and have high hopes for the other Wolf Pack across the country. This should be a great early season litmus test for each program to determine where they are after a weird year. I suspect Nevada takes the game in an upset.  

My Prediction: Nevada wins  

###***Utah State at Washington State (11:00)***  

Two teams that have hyper-offensive mindsets going into this season, this game could be a shootout that would make for a fun late-night game. I don‚Äôt have much knowledge of what Utah State will look like this season with a new head coach, so it will be interesting to watch and see how they come along. Washington State also has, practically, a first year HC since last season hardly gave him the chance to implement a system and the season was too short to see any real progress being made.  

My Prediction: Washington State wins  

###***Notre Dame at FSU (Sun, 7:30)***  

This game should be handily won by Notre Dame. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt be too excited for such a game, but a rare Sunday CFB game mixed with some unknowns about if FSU is really starting to turn things around makes me cautiously optimistic this could be a good one. This might be a good glance into the future of FSU and their potential in the ACC this season and beyond.  

My Prediction: Notre Dame wins   

###***Louisville vs Ole Miss (Mon, 8:00)***  

This game is one of my favorites being played this year in general. On the surface it just seems like a classic OOC game between middling programs that realistically don‚Äôt have much of a chance at the CFP. But the narrative makes this so much more juicy. Last season these two suffered some brutal losses. They both showed glimpses of great potential, playing playoff teams closer than anyone else had done in the regular season. Yet, they came up short both in those games and in others that could have made their seasons a lot better. Last season was filled with ‚Äúalmosts‚Äù for both programs. And if they want to start turning that narrative around, they have to begin by beating a program who, much like themselves, were also marred by the same affliction.   

My Prediction: Ole Miss wins

Swept Away: Chapter 1," 

**Chapter One:**

Careful not to scare the floating bullfrog away, Leonia carefully aimed her spear gig behind its ears. In one quick motion she drove the spear down as hard as she could into its body. When she pulled it out of the water the frog was still twitching on the end of the prongs.

In the Bayou, early spring was the best time of year to hunt for frogs. The days were starting to heat up and they would come out to sit on the swampy shores or float their heads above the water. They made for easy prey. Now, the last of the daylight was fading and the lightning beetles were crawling out of their rotting logs, lighting up the marsh with their lazy, pulsating glows.

‚ÄúHurry! Grab the basket Ambrose! I got another one,‚Äù she yelled, but when Leonia turned around to place the frog in the basket Ambrose was still laying at the opposite end of the tiny pirogue. His eyes half closed and a goofy smile spread across his face. Minuit, her habitually loafing capybara, was draped across his lap fast asleep.

She glared at her companions ‚Äò*how typical,*‚Äô she thought. She let out a loud huff and kicked the bottom of Ambrose‚Äôs boots. He bolted up and Minuit let out a startled chirrup. ‚ÄúHey! What was that for?‚Äù he shouted indignantly.

‚ÄúStop daydreaming you lazy toad and open the basket!‚Äù

Ambrose threw up his hands, ‚ÄúJeez, that‚Äôs all you had to say.‚Äù He grabbed the basket and lifted open the lid, ‚Äúyou should have enough to fry up for supper now.‚Äù

Leonia‚Äôs eyes widened as she realized how late it was and threw the frog in the basket. ‚ÄúOh shoot, supper! I told Nanette I would come home early and help. I got to get home before she takes a switch to the back of my legs.‚Äù She dropped her spear and picked up an oar, not even hesitating before plunging it into the water and launching the pirogue back in the direction of home.

Ambrose‚Äôs annoyed expression turned into a lop-sided grin. ‚ÄúSlow down Lee. You can‚Äôt get out of it now. You‚Äôre already late.‚Äù

Leonia picked up the second oar and heaved it at Ambrose‚Äôs chest. It fell to the floor of the boat as Minuit scrambled to get out of the way. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôd like to be a little *less* late if I can help it. Now start paddling.‚Äù

‚Äò*Hopefully I can get out of it,‚Äô* she thought. Maybe a feast of fresh frog legs would help convince her aunt to be a little more forgiving this time.

Ambrose grabbed the oar and helped her row towards the village. They knew they were almost back home when they spotted the dozens of colorful lanterns that hung low in the trees. They were lit up and flickering all around them. Hundreds of moths and other insects gathered near their flames, singeing their wings if they flew too close.

‚ÄúHey Lee, you think I can borrow your pirogue tomorrow night? I‚Äôm gonna ask Katie to come look at the stars with me.‚Äù

Leonia scoffed at the idea. ‚ÄùThere‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre borrowing my dad‚Äôs boat just so you can get frisky with some girl. You‚Äôll end up sinking it. It‚Äôs all I have left of him and mom.‚Äù

Ambrose feigned a sad expression and started begging, ‚ÄúPlease? I won‚Äôt sink it. I Promise. Just this one time?‚Äù

She pretended to think on it for a few more seconds. ‚ÄúNah,‚Äù She said shaking her head, ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do it. You‚Äôd have to take me too.‚Äù

Ambrose crossed his arms and looked away. ‚ÄúJust forget it then. I‚Äôm not taking you out with me and Katie.‚Äù

Leonia shrugged her shoulders and continued paddling. She knew Ambrose couldn‚Äôt stay angry for long.

After a few more minutes, they reached the edge of the village. It was small, situated in an isolated inlet of the bayou and built on the backs of the giant, floating comb jellies that made their homes in the brackish water. Minuit let out a chorus of excited chirping noises when she caught sight of it. There were about fifty of them in all, but only half of them were occupied by the village . The jellyfish‚Äôs transparent bodies glowed blue and purple under the moonlight, their tentacles trailed beneath the waters welcoming them back home. A few people were still milling about outside. Letty was exactly where she was sitting a few hours earlier, fishing for bream, and old man Ducote was whittling his animal figurines by the light of an open door.

They pulled their boat up onto the jellyfish‚Äôs springy shore. As they stepped out, Ambrose grabbed the basket of frogs and flung it into Leonia‚Äôs arms. Their feet made shallow impressions on the firm gelatinous ground as they walked back home. After saying goodbye, they separated for the night and Leonia marched quickly back to the hut she shared with Aunt Nannette and her sister June. Minuit broke out in a trot as she struggled to keep up.

As soon as Leonia rounded the corner of their hut, a small figure stepped out of the dark\*.\*

*‚ÄòWow, it‚Äôs crazy how* *much June looks like Momma,‚Äô* she thought. June‚Äôs golden hair ran past her shoulders in subtle waves and her dark blue eyes glistened in the dim light that streamed through the windows. Leonia on the other hand looked more like her dad. Plain brown hair and eyes, and tanned skin from all the time spent outdoors.

‚ÄúNanette‚Äôs been waitin‚Äô on you,‚Äù June shouted, grinning. She looked back at the open door of the hut, half expecting Nannette to be standing there.

‚ÄúHush,‚Äù Leonia hissed between gritted teeth, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk so loud or‚Äî""

Nanette walked through the doorway, glaring at Leonia, ‚ÄúToo late ya troublesome child. I been waitin‚Äô on ya all evenin‚Äô. Get your butt into this house ‚Äòfore I skin the hide off yer bones, both of ya.‚Äù

They walked inside and Leonia shot her sister an angry look as June stuck out her tongue. She set her basket of frogs on the tiny kitchen table and slouched into a nearby wooden chair.

‚ÄúWhere ya been girl?‚Äù Nannette asked, looking down her nose. Nanette wasn‚Äôt just their aunt, she was their great aunt, and at eighty-nine years old she was still in good health and her mind was still as sharp as a tack.

‚ÄúI was gigging for frogs with Ambrose,‚Äù Leonia explained, ‚Äúlook! We speared over a dozen of ‚Äòem.‚Äù She opened the basket to show her, but Nanette looked less than impressed.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe for one hot-second that boy lifted a finger in helpin‚Äô you get them frogs. And I don‚Äôt like ya running off with him for so long. You know how boys are. Always friskin‚Äô and foolin‚Äô.‚Äù

Leonia‚Äôs face flushed bright pink. ‚ÄúIt ain't like that Aunty,‚Äù she said, avoiding her aunt's gaze and staring at the floor.

Nanette waved her hands dismissively, ‚ÄúMm hmm. Ok,‚Äù but she knew better than that. Leonia and Ambrose had been stuck to each other since they were about six years old, ever since they both lost their fathers in that devastating hurricane the same year, and Ambrose was just as sweet on Leonia as she was on him though he would never admit it.

June giggled from the corner of the kitchen as she watched the exchange.

Nanette turned and pointed her finger. ‚ÄúWhat you laughin‚Äô at girl? Yer still in trouble for all them skinks you been hiding under yer bed, keepin‚Äô as pets.‚Äù

It was Junes turn to flush bright pink.

Nanette clapped her hands together and nodded at the girls. ‚ÄúAlright then, you two get to skinning and quartering these frogs so we can fry ‚Äòem up.‚Äù

\*\*\*\*\*\*

Later that night Leonia woke up in the room she shared with her sister. Minuit had jumped up in the bed beside her shaking and shivering. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù She cooed, stroking her fur. The haze of sleep still fogged her brain as she looked around the room. June had woken up too and was sitting up in bed.

‚ÄúYou hear that?‚Äù June whispered as she jumped out of bed. Just then another noise came from outside. ‚ÄúThere! I heard it again.‚Äù

This time Leonia heard it too. It sounded like angry shouting. They raced out of the bedroom and into the small sitting area at the front of the hut. Nannette was awake now too and came out of her bedroom holding a broom. A moth-eaten shawl was draped around her shoulders. She pointed the broom in their direction, ‚ÄúYou girls stay in the house. I‚Äôll go see what all the fuss is about.‚Äù

The girls followed Nanette outside anyway and the smell of smoke hit their noses immediately. Their eyes began to water. Over on the adjacent jellyfish they saw huge flames rising up in the dark sky. A hut was engulfed in fire. Leonia squinted her eyes in an effort to see beyond the flames and what she saw startled her. Standing there were three massive, silvery-white alligators.

Leonia had heard peoples‚Äô stories of their encounters with white alligators but had never actually seen one herself. She knew they were much more ferocious than the typical gators they ran into. The ones she was looking at now were saddled and bridled. A rider sat on top of each one.

The rider on the largest alligator was wearing pale face paint and shouting at their village headman. She couldn‚Äôt quite make out what he was saying from this distance but it sounded like he was making demands.

Leonia glanced around the village. Just like her, other villagers stood outside their huts watching the spectacle. She spotted Ambrose in the crowd next to Katie and his mother taking in the scene as well. She ran over to talk with them as June and Minuit followed close behind.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening Ambrose? Who are those people?‚Äù

His expression was grim. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Lee.‚Äù

Katie frowned and gave the two a disapproving glance. ‚ÄúDaddy says they‚Äôre from the other side of the bayou. They don‚Äôt want us here no more.‚Äù

Even though Leonia had never seen them before, she knew Katie meant the Guerrier tribe. They were hostile and dangerous and no one was allowed to go near their territory. But still, Leonia couldn‚Äôt understand why these people would want to kick them out of the lands they had lived on for centuries. ‚Äò*Why do they want us gone? What have we ever done to them?‚Äô*

They continued to watch the Guerrier tribe shout their demands at the headman. No one was sure how much time had passed when the riders finally decided to leave. They pulled on the reigns that controlled the gators and they slung their massive heads around. Their tails whipping behind them as they stomped to the edge of the jellyfish shore and slid back into the water. The tribesmen sat cross legged on their backs guiding them away.

Leonia turned her head away to see Nanette and the other elders walk over to the headman. She assumed they had a few things to discuss and hoped that everything could be resolved. All she and the others could do now was watch the departing Guerrier tribe glide away and look on as a part of their peaceful village burned.",Say_Im_Writing,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Say_Im_Writing/comments/pdank1/swept_away_chapter_1/,,Say_Im_Ugly,pdank1,/r/Say_Im_Writing/comments/pdank1/swept_away_chapter_1/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Say_Im_Writing/comments/pdank1/swept_away_chapter_1/,0,2021-08-28

"34-M-UK looking for a new chat buddy, apply within!","Greetings to you and you,

Thank you for stopping by on my post it‚Äôs almost certainly won‚Äôt be the best one you‚Äôll read but I appreciate you stopping by none the less.

The lockdown has been going on far too long now and it‚Äôs made seeing the circle of friends I did have extremely difficult so here I am browsing the dark subs of Reddit looking to make some new acquaintances. A little bit about me, i hear you ask? Well I‚Äôm like the average person on here liking music and films amongst a few other things (I‚Äôd list them but I‚Äôve just got stage freight! Oh no!) oh i remembered something! I enjoy photography and snapping away at everything I see, maybe one day I‚Äôll get that perfect photo. Although i can‚Äôt remember much, that just means more things to speak about right? I did forget to mention I‚Äôm from the Greatest of Britain‚Äôs.

I‚Äôd like to speak to someone of the opposite gender from either Europe or America (Canada at a push). It would be cool if you‚Äôre down if you could speak a few times a day but I know life gets in the way but working from home the majority of the time, it would definitely help pass the time. 

Sinace it seems to be a deal breaker with a few I thought I‚Äôd mention I‚Äôm in a relationship, with the whole lockdowns and working from home the loneliness is definitely starting to show...

And to finish my post I‚Äôll leave a quote by one of the greatest motivational speakers of all time - ‚Äúyou miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take‚Äù - Michael Scott.

If you‚Äôve made it this far you deserve a medal!",makingfriends,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/makingfriends/comments/pdesh0/34muk_looking_for_a_new_chat_buddy_apply_within/,,hugo_ball5,pdesh0,/r/makingfriends/comments/pdesh0/34muk_looking_for_a_new_chat_buddy_apply_within/,https://www.reddit.com/r/makingfriends/comments/pdesh0/34muk_looking_for_a_new_chat_buddy_apply_within/,0,2021-08-28

nsfw  
  
The girl is 100% wears the pants in the relationship but loves to play the perfect wife/girlfriend to the typical traditional stereotypes. she is in love but it's shaking when Tim tells her he wants her to cut him. she also thinks it's strange because she knows for a fact that the guys that Tim talks about fully don't like.  
  
She's hoping that Tim and her get married in college and get out from under his strict parents the dynamic is that she is more mature and leaves Tim in the end because no real  man whatever ask his girlfriend to do this  
  
Scene 1  the gym  
  
Becky is with her personal trainer. Tim thinks and how much older he is than the both of them. He's making her catch a medicine ball while doing sit ups. Becky is so definitely flexed and sweaty. she's brunette  5 foot 7 34b size to jeans 36 inch hips 115 lb. I'm only an inch taller than her. And, if we weren't so touchy feely in public some people might think we were brother and sister.  
  
. her family has its own personal trainer where is I don't really know what I'm doing. She's so proud of her long torso and toned abs . the personal trainer is fit and attractive and Tim is a little jealous. He's older around 40 years old shaved head fit but also you can tell he isn't as cut as when he was younger. definitely loves to kid around with Becky. his name is Bill Savage. ex-marine, but is privatized security Now doing personal training on the side.  
  
Becky where's a sports bra in yoga shorts a size too small so you can see the outline of her p\*\*\*\* her abs are insanely tone but she carries some extra way in the back of her thighs and ass most guys would notice and admit that she is got to be a little extra thick but her ideal body type isn't the same idea. she is always saying she is too fat even though she's not.  
  
He grabs  
  
We are both home schooled so we have tons of time and she's always working on her apps

THE GYM  
  
Becky is with her personal trainer. Tim thinks and how much older he is than the both of them. He's making her catch a medicine ball while doing sit ups. Becky is so definitely flexed and sweaty. she's brunette  5 foot 7 34b size to jeans 36 inch hips 115 lb . her family has its own personal trainer where is I don't really know what I'm doing. She's so proud of her long torso and toned abs . the personal trainer is fit and attractive and Tim is a little jealous.

Becky where's a sports bra in yoga shorts a size too small so you can see the outline of her p\*\*\*\* her abs are insanely tone but she carries some extra way in the back of her thighs and ass most guys would notice and admit that she is got to be a little extra thick but her ideal body type isn't the same idea. she is always saying she is too fat even though she's not.  
  
Bill is wearing a pair of dorky champion shorts and an equally dorky cut off sleeve XXL shirt. Paired with his white generic dad shoes. Becky eats it up.  
  
He grabs on to her ankles as she works. he is getting more effort out of her by speaking down to her about her flaws. she lets out a little a little giggle as she bends down for him. Tim would never talk to her like that. and that's why he makes her so wet.  
  
""come on thunder thighs last set ""As Bill shoves the medicine ball back down ""do you want that pizza then work for it ""Tim is across the gym and can't hear him  
  
""yes sir! ""she says with a smirk on her face.  
  
""what's so funny? You think this is fun? Get serious now baby let's go! "" Bill coaches her up ""scared to mess up your makeup?   
  
 ""I am serious bill, i swear!.but your insults are kinda of cute lol‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShut up and work bitch!‚Äù Bill shuts her down cold. He makes her feel like a piece of shit knowing that she wont be going for cake and ice cram later.  
  
Even with Becky's bf across the room she cant help but think how hot bill is and instead of ice cream  she is starting to have thoughts of his face on her pussy  
  
Tim thinks ‚Äúlooks like that wildcat is getting a good workout from that old fucker.‚Äù she is glistening sweat and being pushed to her limits. Her brow furrowed as her abs burn uncontrollably. She is a total tomboy when her competitive side surfaces. She would never admit defeat even when out gunned. She is perfect life mate and Tim has taken advantage of her like some kind of sibling rivalry  
  
‚ÄúC‚Äômon girl! You don't want your future husband sneaking off to poker night with the boys instead of a date night with your fine ass.‚Äù Bill urges  
  
‚ÄúYe sir!‚Äù She shouts as she busts out the last three reps.  
  
Bill Smirks ‚ÄúC‚Äômon three more.‚Äù Becky struggles to get 3 more in pain ‚Äúdo it for Bill.‚Äù she thinks  
  
‚ÄúI cant hear you down there.‚Äù she gets the last rep ‚ÄúAnd done! Good Girl!‚Äù  
  
Tim is shocked looking across the gym almost not recognizing her husky voice  
  
‚Äúoh my god bill you really worked me hard today.‚Äù she says while gasping for air  
  
‚ÄúI told you I was gonna get in that ass girl. You know its all out of love, right?‚Äù bill says  
  
‚Äúi know.‚Äù she says while giggling and blushing  
  
‚Äúgo get some water. Your face is flushed.‚Äù bill says  
  
As she goes to get some water, she waves to me from across the gym. Then fixes her hair. Arms over her head. I see her all sweaty and pumped up. Yoga shorts obviously soaked in sweat.  
  
I'm dying to get back to our spot on the comfy couch at her place. Pig out and watch action/thrillers  
  
‚Äúomg I cant wait to eat and be lazy with baby bill is really working me to death lol.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúyour shoulders and arms are looking pumped up. I wouldn't wanna mess with you after seeing you on that punching bag.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOMG they are!‚Äù She heads for the water fountain, anyone else would think she was blowing me off slightly  
  
Becks bends over to take a drink. Yoga shorts so tight you can see her puss lips and it stands out even more as it glistens from the sweat. The Gym is filled with geriatrics so there isn't any real alphas other than Becky and Bill. So every old perv in the gym is stating at the darker spot in my crotch. Becky has really been hitting the gym hard before school starts up. Its become like her second home. So every old guy knows her ass and face. Its kinda of funny to her that Tim is oblivious to the amount of old man strength that could slap Tim around. Becky is obviously the attention she receives. It drives her crazy.  
  
The young Sweet hearts disappear into the p lot to her cute blue beetle. And head to Becky's house with her cool parents. I follow her down stairs. We walk by her sister in the main TV room on our way down to her basement room.  
  
‚ÄúHey I don't really want to hang out with your sister today.‚Äù Tim complained  
  
‚ÄúI mean yes babe but what about me needing to shower?‚Äù Her cheeks still a little flushed  
  
‚Äúwell what do you want me to do?‚Äù  
  
‚Äúlol babe I'm soo wore out!!‚Äù she said ‚Äò I just want to shower and a back massage maybe?‚Äù her voice went up in pitch  
  
Becky takes a quick shower and comes out in just a towel. Tim walks on her back but only if she plays with him while they watch a movie. Becky gushes in pain and pleasure as her fully grown boyfriend walks on her back.  
  
Bill text Becky her nutrition schedule and a couple pics he took of her at the gym for a reference  
  
Tim ask if Bill will train him at some point.  
  
‚Äúi think he will-unnnnnnnnhhhhhhhhhhh.‚Äù she grunts hard until she is bursting with laughter. ‚Äúomg that feels so good babe.‚Äù Tim has a good amount of his weight on her big ol‚Äôbooty. Moaning lightly in pleasure as my toes dig into her swollen glutes.  
  
‚Äúyour were so gorgeous when you get focused at the gym.‚Äù I always lay it on thick with the compliments when I want a Beej  
  
‚Äúwhat you mean baby?‚Äù  
  
‚Äúwhen you were yelling back at Bill.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú You liked that?‚Äù  
  
‚Äúyea! I never heard your voice so raspy. It was loud‚Ä¶ like really loud. I think everyone was shocked the first couple of times.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúreally lol‚Äù making an embarrassed frown but smiling through her piecing hazel eyes ‚Äúbabe what are you trying to say?‚Äù  
  
‚Äú haha, That I really liked watching Bill get the best of you. Just how worked up you got. Are you always that intense, like a dude?‚Äù  
  
‚Äúbaby what do you mean, he was pushing my limits?‚Äù  
  
‚Äúyeah but I could see how fat your pussy looked while you were at the water fountain.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOh yeah?‚Äù  
  
Im now pushing hard through her lower back to her round bubble butt. If she wasnt to occupied with text bill Tim would have taken a bite of her perfect apple bottom.  
  
‚ÄúYour ass is so perfect.‚Äù Kisses her right on the left cheek ‚Äú don't lie, ok?‚Äù  
  
‚Äúok babe...‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWas bill turning you on today?‚Äù  
  
‚Äúwoah.. Where did that come from?  
  
‚Äú Am I wrong?‚Äù I start to retreat ‚ÄúIm so sorry,I'm so stupid..‚Äù  
  
‚Äúbaby your not stupid.. What did you mean?? Like seriously, talk to me?‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi don't knowI'm not really sure we should talk about this.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúso Like you had a bad dream and I was fucking Bill.‚Äù \*  
  
when she said those words It felt like my body got 50 lbs heavier  
  
‚Äúuhhnnnnhuh‚Äù my eyes start to lid over and I kiss her right ass cheek lovingly, then collapse on top of her hugging her child bearing hips, laying my head on her back.  
  
‚Äúbaby whats going on???WTF.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú‚ÄùYou looked very flirty with Bill today. I saw you Bend over for him.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBabe, its just the workout he told me to do!‚Äù  
  
‚Äúhe is so old and and gross , but your letting him hold you in the awkward positions?‚Äù  
  
‚Äú I mean sure it was nice and it felt great to him.. but I think your exaggerating.‚Äù  
  
Tim postures back up and moves to kisses her squishes her face into the couch in a rough housing kinda of way. Becky clearly is turned on by this behavior as her worried face turns into a playful smirk  
  
‚Äúand wait, you actually want me to fuck bill!??‚Äù she finally realized ‚Äú whats wrong with you.‚Äù \*  
  
‚Äú I don't know ‚Ä¶I'm scared to say anything else. Please don't take this the wrong way.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúbabe. You've said so much you might as well finish so maybe I understand a little‚Äù  
  
‚Äú Its just talk. Okay? I love you and I can‚Äôt wait to marry you.‚Äù he pauses ‚Äú but, don‚Äôt you want to see what else is out there?‚Äù  
  
‚Äú No! I just want to be faithful to you. Why, Do you??!‚Äù  
  
‚Äú it‚Äôs not like that, I know your the best thing that's ever happened to me. So I could never Cheat on you.‚Äù He tries to shift the her anger somewhere else. I stand up pulling her up in front of her full length mirror. Pulling her towel around her hour glass body tightly ‚ÄúLook at your fuh-uh-cking body and tell me I get you off as much as you get me.‚Äù  
  
She takes a second to admire herself  
  
‚ÄúTell me who is hotter right now?‚Äù  
  
She rolls her eyes ‚Äú Okay... Okay‚Ä¶ Me I guess..‚Äù  
  
‚Äúwhat do you mean, You guess?‚Äù  
  
She tries not to let her confident smile show so much. ‚ÄúI mean.. I get your point but what are you getting at?‚Äù  
  
Becky holds her towel at the top. And I run my hands down her hips checking out her curves. ‚Äúi want to watch you fuck. Not making love like we do.I'm talking about hardcore sport fucking baby. Look at you. You built to take a pounding.‚Äù  
  
He almost backs out of the whole convo but doesn't. ‚ÄúLook I know your almost orgasm arn‚Äôt the real thing. I just want to see if someone else can make you cum differently.‚Äù he really is being honest but Becky is starting to think ‚ÄúOMG TMI!!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúPlease don't be mad but just admit you would like if Bill ordered you around in the bed like he does in the gym.‚Äù Beck‚Äôs eyes shift imploring the idea but shaking it off ‚Äúdon't lie.‚Äù he finally prods.  
  
‚ÄúOkay fine! I kind of do like being submissive to him. It turns me on to be put in my place.‚Äù  
  
Disheartened to here the truth. I draw a blank as she hits me with her admission that I practically beat out of her.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry..‚Äù  
  
‚Äúno I'm the sorry one, I should have told Bill to settle down at the gym.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúbaby please don't say anything to him. I cant get a new trainer at this point of my training.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúi should have stepped in and let him know I was your boyfriend at the very least.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúbaby he knows.‚Äù he voice going up in pitch trying to soothe the obvious misstep I made.  
  
‚Äúyeah maybe, but he doesn't know your bf was the guy watching on the tread mill as he called you the B-word.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúBabyI'm so sorry!!‚Äù  
  
‚Äúdid you see how he walked right by me like a smug asshole?‚Äù Tim is overcome with his mishap ‚Äú I hate him.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúbaby no, hate such a strong word. Please don't.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú I don't want you training with that guy.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúbaby !! Please don't!! Please!‚Äù  
  
‚Äú Why shouldn't I hate that guy.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúbecause Tim that behavior is inappropriate and uncalled for! You are better than that‚Ä¶ no.‚Äù She implores tim to be more understanding ‚ÄúWe, are better than that‚Äù Becks is almost in tears  
  
‚Äúi cant believe this That guy is like 50.‚Äù and he ingnores her only request ‚Äú I HATE that grey haired fuck.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúbaby please ‚Äú she begs as tears start to rol ldown her face  
  
‚Äú I have fought off every guy at school for you and all along your smitten by this older man.‚Äù He never saw that coming  
  
‚ÄúBaby stop it!!!‚Äù  
  
‚Äúugh disgusting.‚Äù I look at her in the mirror then see my cockblock pussface is on full blast.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that!!‚Äù she is sobbing in just a towel begging me to just let it go.  
  
‚Äú are you gonna tell everyone your boyfriend is a Cuck now.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo baby, I promise.‚Äù as she is ugly crying now  
  
I watch her wishing she would stop crying at this point. ‚ÄúYour just crying because you want bill even more.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú thats not true I love you.‚Äù as she cries ‚Äúbaby please!‚Äù she is sitting in front of me sobbing now naked . Tears running down her body.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú Maybe You can call bill over here to stop you from your ugly cry.‚Äù I put bluntly  
  
I find his number off linkdn.  
  
‚Äúbaby please! Stop it. Please you‚Äôre being so mean to me.:‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúCmon, prove it to me your ready for marriage baby.‚Äù As I try my hardsest to get her to commit to seeing him ‚ÄúGet dressed up really nice and act like a good wife.‚Äù  
  
I sit next to her and put my arm around her, and kisses her wet steaming cheeks  
  
‚Äúok baby‚Ä¶‚Äù she says and stands up wiping her tears. Walking to her bedroom to shower.  
  
As she is in the shower I stand behind the curtain mansplaining to her ‚ÄúJust think of this as ‚Äòthe Marriage test‚Äô. If it goes well then we will know it‚Äôs meant to be knowingly holding the carot in front of her face. ‚Äúdon't worry babe. I bet Bill will get a kick out of you looking like a Stepford wife.‚Äù  
  
She washes out the the herbal essence shampoo ‚Äú okay.. so dress nice?‚Äù  
  
‚Äú yeah. don't you wanna look the part of Husband and my hot wife.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú well I guess babe. That makes sense. Ill go throw something nice and respactable.‚Äù Ever since she met me all she has ever wanted was to get married and be the perfect homemaker.  
  
She walks out the shower asI'm texting on the toilet. I see her naked wet body dripping wet. ‚ÄúYour such a babe.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI know. I know!‚Äù  
  
Im sitting on her basment couch texting Bill for directions to his Riverside condo, but pretending to be her.  
  
Becky walks out her bedroom wearing a black cocktail dress with a high slitfully reaveling her soft thigh at the right angle, and high heels. I twirl my finger in the air and she spins around for me so I can see from all those angles.  
  
‚Äú I texted Bill and he said he was going to grill out anyways. He siad he has enough protien for both of us. He says not to worry anbout counting calories either.‚Äù  
  
‚Äúwell I guess that sounds fun.‚Äù Becky walks back into the bathroom to finish her make-up. I watch from outside the bathroom. She puts on the finishing touches and I hear the container click shut. She turns around looking at me with a smile. ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶ how do I look?‚Äù  
  
My eyes don't really register as I look away frim the Football game. I almost don't even recognize the woman before me. I say woman because she looks like she means business instead of a cute girl who works retail at the mall folding clothes all day.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm ready baby.‚Äù Her huskey voice matches her smokey eyes.  
  
‚Äúyeah...‚Äù I pause taking her in ‚Äúyou look ready.I'm mean wow Dom. That dress is straight fire. How come you never wear that for just me.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI don't know‚Ä¶ I guees I‚Äôve just never had a reason to wear it until now baby.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú well I know one thing. I would fuck you six ways until sunday.‚Äù Becks pulls back playfully and I have to struggle to pull her in to squeeze her body.  
  
She giggles. I cant tell she feels really pretty so she doesnt mind the crude remark. As she lets out a noise as I pull her in and say ‚Äú Then do it.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYou want before we go?‚Äù She nods her head innocently. AndI'm already fliping off my belt.  
  
I bend her over and pull up her little dress for a quikie. I fuck her like crazy and quickly bust a nut that drains the power from my legs. All my mind can think of to say is a slow drawn out ‚Äú good‚Ä¶ God‚Ä¶ Babe.‚Äù She feels so soft as I push up into her. My dead weight leans up against Becky  
  
She pulls her panties up as my cum is leaking out of her pussy. ‚Äúyes baby I love feeling your warm cum inside me.‚Äù  
  
I felt completely brainless and in so much ecstacy that It was impossible to form a coherent thought at all. Becky is in another league when it comes to sex. That when ,y post-nut sydrome kicks in andI'm starting to rethink going to this older guys condo souly to show off my gf.  
  
Becky grabs me and pulls me in for a kss. ‚Äúlets go baby.‚Äù and I cant help but follow that ass anywhere. We head out of the side door. No one sees us and she leads the way to her car.  
  
She hands me her keys. We get in her car and while drivingI'm lost in thought. I start to think about what our wedding would be like. I thinkabout how we would have the perfectplace with a bar to make drinks in our home together. I think about all these things that ive promised her. Without any shred of dignity. It all feels so close now that we are playing our little game.  
  
Dominiuq sits quietly besides me on the way to bills. My mind spinning in thought. We pul into his driveway and I park the car. Bills condo is just off the river at the end of the community, tucked away. We sit out side in silence, neither of really know what we are supposed to do once inside. But one thing is for sure. We both are attracted to this mans aura.  
  
I get out and open Beckys door. She grabs her purse and I hand her back her set of car keys ‚ÄúI want to marry so much after today.‚Äù shutting the door behind her. My hands slip down her back and rest on top of her plumped ass cheeks. We walk to the door and she knocks. I fumble with where to put my hands and anxiously ring the doorbell. Becky looks at me like I have no clue whatI'm doing.  
  
‚Äúthe door bell is for strangers. I cant belive you Tim. How uncouth.‚Äù I forget how she was raised to be very proper when being a guest. No matter the function. Its a small bump in the road that will inevitably lead to many more. Becky takes a deep breath settling both of our nerves. We hear the deadbolt lock slide.  
  
He laughs and yells ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs ready for Bills Booty Boot Camp!‚Äù His laugh is hard and forcefull ‚Äúcome here now.‚Äù Bill answers the door and Becky greats him with a hug and a big smile. Bill is 6‚Äô2 and pulls her up off her heels a tiny bit. He pulls her inside to show her around, but I get left at the doorstep. I walkin tentavly and shut the door behind me.  
  
Looking at Becky I can tell she adire Bills condo that he renovated him self to be more modern-contemporary ‚Äú It‚Äôs Beautiful.‚Äù She is very complementary and paying attention to detail. She always had a knack for interior design at a young age.  
  
Bill points out his open floor plan living area then shows Becky upstairs to show his floating stairs, then to his office, then to his master bedroom. I stay in the Foyer area not sure if Bill saw me at the door. They head back downstairs in mid convoseration. Becky leading the way.  
  
Bill sees me from the stairs standing there with a thumb up my butt. ‚ÄúBut I see you didnt come alone.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWell, of course not silly.‚Äù  
  
they both walk past me into the lower level tv area, again without a proper introduction. ‚Äúspin around darling‚Äù bill twirls her harmlessly butI'm picking up on his overly affectionate vibes. ‚Äúdamn sexy mama. I did a good job with you, huh?‚Äù Admiring his work. Becky and I make eye contact after her first twirl and she looks semi embarrased before giggling and blushing for Bill.  
  
Bill says flat out ‚Äú Stick It out and bounce that Honky Tonk Badonka Donka.‚Äù Just hearing that cheese dick almost made me feel embarrased for him until I see my girlfriend bend over slightly. Bill can see from the side. I watch her from behind and I can see the wetness in her panties. He hold sher hand up high above her head. She giggles and and laughs playfully as she sahkes her ass for Bill.  
  
‚ÄúHAHA there it is. C‚ÄôMon now, its not like you need to be shy. Ive been there for every squat. As he positions himself behind her blocking my view as if he is at the gym spotting her for a heavy set.‚Äù Becky turns her head side ways to look behind. ‚ÄúRemember?‚Äù he asks  
  
‚ÄúOh yeah I remember Form before Force.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThats right. You gotta see it before you do it‚Ä¶ Now do it.‚Äù The two both go down in a synchronized squat as if she was literally at the gym. Bill locks his hips to hers. It looks as if he was mounting her from behind. They both come up from the deep squat routine and Slips his hand over my girlfriends ass all nonchaulant saying ‚ÄúKnock the sweat off it that butt.‚Äù I was about to interject but I see the smile on her face when he gropes with his flat palm.  
  
I don't let mself believe that Bill just tounched the ass of my girlfried and best friend. But from my angle it was clear. Plus its not like he slapped Beckys ass.  
  
‚Äú I want show you the view of the river from the back porch.‚Äù Bill says before grabbing her hand escorting herto the sliding glass door.  
  
Im trying to keep cool and all I can think about is how hot she looks and that when we get married there will be thousands of guys that will tak a crack at Becky. I take a couple steps towards the two and can hear teasing Becky about her sausage fingers. She giggles as he then pulls her hand to his face and kisses it. I cough.  
  
‚ÄúBet your hands are bigger than your boyfriend.‚Äù He looks over at me approaching for a handshake. ‚ÄúSteve is it? Isn't that his name?.‚Äù Bill winks at Becky  
  
‚ÄúI do not!‚Äù She doesn't even correct his slight.  
  
‚ÄúHey Steve..‚Äù He pauses for my reaction. ‚Äúcan you help me out with my Premium Package channel. Gosh! I got so many I don't know how to pair it with my satellite dish. You can figure that easy cant you? I'm not what you call Tech savvy.‚Äù  
  
‚Äú Uh yeah but its..‚Äù I look at Becks for him to correct him ‚ÄúI mean yeah I can do that for you if you want?‚Äù  
  
What the fuck was I saying!! This guy cant even get my name right. And She didnt even correct him.  
  
I laugh/scoff ‚Äú it‚Äôs Tim by the way.‚Äù and we shake hands finally seeing eye to eye like real men.  
  
Bill smiles ‚Äú ill give you a hundred bucks if you do. How‚Äôs that Tim.‚Äù He then looks at her waiting by the sliding glass door. Under his breath I Hear him saying something in a low tone.  
  
‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Becky looks over at me then back to Bill. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI guess I just figured‚Ä¶‚Äù then they disapeered through the doorway. I was already connecting cables and trying different aux inputs. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a suitor but will he hunt and gather for you too.‚Äù his tone becomes more fatherly. ‚ÄúI mean shit., I thought he was your cousin or family friend when I saw you two at the gym together.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHe does his best Bill, He‚Äôs really sweet.‚Äù she says ‚ÄúOh no he is my Boyfriend silly.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúOh I figured that when I saw him holding your purse out from in my driveway.‚Äù Bill looked back through the glass door as I was working for him now. ‚ÄùWell I don't see why all you young girls go for the Star Wars fanatics but hey? If Steve is worth his weight at all it will be in the tech world.‚Äù  
  
Becky smiles graciously and walks to the banister to get a wider view of the riverfront as bill is getting a view of her her fat cheeks mashed together by her synthetic blend cotton cocktail dress .  
  
I'd like for things to progressively get more blatant and devious. Finally at a certain point, when you realize that you might be down to hook up with other guys in front of me, I balk on the opportunity. Pulling the rug out from underneath you, and you feel cheapened and slighted. And rather than deal with it, I avoid a confrontation. So maybe you just end up on a couch with one of them guys. Knowing there wouldn't be a confrontation afterwards, you weigh the pros and cons of cheating on me. ‚ÄúEither way it was his idea‚Äù rationale ‚Äúserves him right.‚Äù You did invite me to come chill too, but I'm somewhere else playing video games and smoking grass. This encourages you to become more cruel when peers see that you're being pushed aside until it's convenient. Until you are almost daring me to do something about it. (Mocking me, playing wicked phone games, dropping hints during sex.)  
  
If you've liked what you read so far on cheating betrayal/ gas lit cuckolding scenarios (Young love maturing, Homewrecking, Bullies, Sacrilege, etc) get me a message. Chat me Dm me third party app after that.

[F4M] A woman fucking much older men on her vacation! (light hearted roleplay),"**Post is still open! Please read the whole post!**

Hey there!

Today, I'm looking to play a roleplay focusing on the large age gap between a younger woman and a much older man!

This scenario will be taking place at a sunny vacation resort with long beaches, palm trees and of course a cozy hotel! The roleplay itself will take place in the hotel itself where our characters can meet up at the small pool area bar, the restaurant on the ground floor, or when out for a walk close by. I do prefer it to not be a beach scenario, as I like the characters to be a bit more clothed at first, to not show off too much from the start!

She'll be a young woman, aged 20-25 years old, a somewhat regular college girl who managed to get away on a vacation this year, traveling alone. This gives her all the freedom she wants, no other people to schedule her vacation around. This also gives her the freedom to test out a couple of things she would most likely be judged for with her friends around, which is meeting up and have sex with men waaay older than her! It's been something she's been wanting to try out for a while, but haven't had a good chance to do it discretely in her home town. 

As for her personality, she'll be rather casual and easy going, not looking for any big romance, or any wild mindless sex, she just wants to have fun, hang ut with an old man, get to test out what sex is like with that age contrast and body contrast as well. When it comes to her looks, I like to discuss that when we're setting the roleplay up, though I like her to be a more everyday looking girl, rather than some model or porn star

Him on the other side, is also a rather regular person, a bit older at 65-75 years old. He's on his yearly vacation with his old wife as they enjoy the smaller slower resorts, not much happening so they can really enjoy the weather and relax. As for his body, he's got a regular dad bod with a little bit of belly etc, but nothing extreme in any way there. The cock would be of normal size as well, maybe a bit of a grower in his old age! As for his personality, I like him to be kind of open minded and relaxed as well. He's happily married, but won't turn down the chance to spice things out a little bit on a vacation, especially with a younger woman, and as long as his wife don't find out.

As for the scenario itself, I like them running into each other spontaneously. His wife could be a bit tired and head off to their room to get some rest, leaving him able to chat with her discretely. A good place to start could be her sitting down at the bar relaxing when he arrives there as well, and they start to talk from there. I'd love this to not be rushed, with some build up etc, rather than them jumping straight into fucking. If both are casual enough, they could talk about sex in an open way, and decide to try some things out as well at her room after that. I'm open for other ideas as well, but I prefer this kind of normal way to meet up!

As most roleplays includes a lot of flirting and the characters playing games, using inuendos etc, I'd like to not do that for this roleplay, as I love them to be able to talk openly and honestly about this, not needing to play around or flirting. During the sex, I also like this to continue, making them have some fun and chat etc, just so it's not mindless fucking. I've been in a lot of roleplays where the characters are having fun, and then suddenly when the sex starts, they lose all their personality and it's just wild moaning and humping. I don't want that in this roleplay, as I think their interaction shouldn't get lost when the sex starts :)

Overall, I like this roleplay to be fun and light hearted, leaving out dark or abusive themes.

* **Kinks:** Oral, vaginal, anal, clothed sex, casual sex, age contrast, body contrast, everyday people
* **Limits:** Toilet stuff, impregnation, violence, abuse, male anal, squirting, deepthroat, rough sex, people controlling my character in the roleplay, dominance

So, I hope you like the idea for this roleplay and the theme! I only roleplay this in Reddit Pm:s though, so please **don't use the chat** and don't suggest other mediums to play in. I'm also looking for more detailed roleplayers for this, and don't require walls of text, but please no one liner responses or very low effort ones. 

To make it a bit easier to see what you're into and your thoughts for this roleplay, please send the response and answer the following questions in the initial response:

* What are your thoughts on the theme and the scenario?
* What are your kinks, that don't conflict with my limits or the light hearted theme?
* What are your limits?
* Are you open to play this out now as a rapid response roleplay?
* Are you open for playing this roleplay out with the roles reversed, with you playing as the younger woman and me as the older man?
* Are you open for her being a more everyday looking woman, rather than porn star or model etc? Also open for some rule34 themed characters for her :)

That should be about it! Again, answer th questions above in your initial response, as it helps me a lot to see fromt he start what you're into and open for. While I like to chat with people, it gets very messy if I've got to go through introductions with a lot of people just to find out whether we're looking for the same thing, plus, it's really good to have it all in one place and easy to find if I need to check back on the kinks and thoughts during the roleplay.

As phone app users seem to often have problems finidng the PM:s and often use the chat anyway, please use [this link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=roleplay_emelie) to send a PM to me. 

Hope to hear from you!

24 [M4F] I want to be humiliated and made to watch,"So by my own definition, humiliation means to be made to feel inept or inadequate, lesser, or something along those lines. In the sexual context, you would be telling me I'm not big enough, or that I'm not a real man, or you'd be talking about guys much bigger than me.

I want this to be a long term thing, because I like to be humiliated a good bit. Like no joke I have came so hard from this that I have passed out from it. It's a lot for me, but of course this doesn't have to remain ONLY about this sexual item or even about sexual stuff. We can have friendly conversation all the same.

Now with that being said - let me introduce the scenario:

It's been a long day at work, I go home for the night to your house since we've been dating for a little while. I open the door and call out to you as I close it. I climb your stairs, nothing seemingly out of the ordinary. There may have a few more pairs of panties lying around than I remember, one even ripped with a big hole and one looking soaked... odd, but I don't pay it mind. I get up to your room to see you laying on the bed scantily clothed. I start to get in the mood from seeing you that way, so I make it well known.

Unfortunately, there's an elephant in the room - there's another pair of shoes out in the open by your own. A big pair of shoes. I'm about to notice it and uncover something you've been hiding from me for a long time - your lust and love for big cocks. Bigger than me for sure. I have six inches but ten to twelve... that's what you need. You lost your virginity to some very big guy who spread you wide open and kept fucking you for hours until he filled you all the way up and ruined you for good. You would never accept a small cock like mine anymore. You did for a whole because you sought to be in a relationship and for a while you were happy but then deep inside you, the itch came back. You started seeing guys behind my back, and sometimes you'd fuck them in the next room to try to get me to notice. Then I'd fuck you that night and you'd be upset. No more. Now, you want to force me to watch you get fucked by a big cock. Out of resentment, out of desire to show how to properly fuck, out of desire to cheat, etc etc.

Now keep in mind you are you but you have another person who you get to control, we'll call him Jake. Jake is your big friend who is a real man and you and him are going to make me watch him dick you down. But I have to watch, otherwise the consequences could be... dire for me. 

You know Jake wants me to watch too, so before I came home - you told him: 
""IF I can't get him to watch, make him regret not watching. He's weaker than you, has a smaller dick than you, and hey... best case scenario foryou, I may not be the only tonight but I'll let step in if needed. Oh, and for the record - I can't and won't tell you to stop if it comes to that""



So now that you know the situation please send me a reddit message or a chat for the kik ID. Introduce yourself and we'll go from there.",dirtykikpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/pdckz0/24_m4f_i_want_to_be_humiliated_and_made_to_watch/,M4F,ArklaitGigabyte,pdckz0,/r/dirtykikpals/comments/pdckz0/24_m4f_i_want_to_be_humiliated_and_made_to_watch/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/comments/pdckz0/24_m4f_i_want_to_be_humiliated_and_made_to_watch/,0,2021-08-28

Hey guys!

Today I bring you a massive list of RP Ideas that I‚Äôm constantly working on. These posts are mainly around anime I‚Äôve watched or games/Fandoms I‚Äôm in. However, there are some OC based stuff that might be used either way!

For my replies I only write in first person and the length of my replies vary from a few sentences to a few solid paragraphs depending on how much is going on in a scene. I figured I‚Äôd put a fair warning here that if you reply with low detail, I won‚Äôt be rping with you. I‚Äôm not looking for a few words as a response. While that might be your thing, that's fine and power to you! It‚Äôs just not mine.

I‚Äôm someone who likes a nice balance of build-up and story to go along with the smut. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of constant sex, or sex that starts within one or two replies. I also like cute dates and moments, and love to type out action driven moments.

What I look for in a partner:

Third Person responses (Unless you're playing an OC among the harem)

Active - I don't wanna be waiting a week for a reply. I understand if you're busy outside of RP but please let me know so I'm not just waiting around and twiddling my thumbs. If I go a week without hearing from you at all I'm going to assume you're no longer interested.

Communicative: It kinda links in with the other but if you're not feeling the RP or you're busy IRL I'm not gonna get mad or anything I'm an understanding person!

Detailed responses: Anything 2 sentences up to a paragraph is enough, but more is always very much appreciated.

This one is a bit of a nitpick, but Please don't just message me with ""I'll rp"" Or ""want to rp?"" tell me what rps you wanna do in your initial message! If you're undecided please just list the ones you want to do and we can go there. If you do message me like the previous I'll probably just ignore the message.

For the platforms I mainly do rps on Discord, however I also have a kik and my inbox here. So feel free to ask about my user for either platform.

Now to get into the meat and potatoes, I‚Äôll post my kinks and limits. There‚Äôs a lot there and not all of them will be applicable to the starters. As I‚Äôm a massive fan of harems I‚Äôll put this in bold here. Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies.

Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem. (Sorry if that‚Äôs an issue, I still wish you the best!)

Kinks:

Harems ‚Äì (Which doesn‚Äôt mean playing a bunch of characters at once. If you prefer to play 1 character per scene that‚Äôs fine!)

Outercourse (Which is stiff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging, that kinda thing), Risky/public spaces. (Places you can get caught but don‚Äôt. Toilet stalls, changing booths, that kinda thing), Facials, Freckles (Face and body), Big, nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle‚Ä¶ just an overall fan of the jiggle if I‚Äôm honest), Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, thigh high socks, shower/water sex (places like pools, showers, hot tubs that kinda things, and a Mutual desire for sex. Incest. I also don‚Äôt mind pubic hair as long as it‚Äôs not overly bushy trimmed stuff is nice! :)

Limits:

Pregnacy, which also includes lactation (Hard limit, sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, toilet stuff, noncon/rape, Gagnbangs (reverse gangbangs with females is fine), Male on male, Futas, Rimming/pegging. (There could be more that I haven‚Äôt thought of, if you‚Äôre unsure feel free to ask)

There could be more that I might be into, that hasn‚Äôt been listed so feel free to ask about it and we can work something out. And without further ado let‚Äôs head straight into it.

I‚Äôve made an easy access list for you to read through to see if anything piques your interest before you have to scroll through this abundant list. Of course, I stated this before but I‚Äôll state it again.

Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies. Especially canon characters.

Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem. (Sorry if that‚Äôs an issue, I still wish you the best!)

Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.

(So for this one, my character will be a transfer into class 1-A. From Shiketsu. His power is that of Persuasion. With the power he‚Äôs able to convince someone to do something as if it‚Äôs their own free will. That being said he‚Äôs rather hesitant to use it on other people and due to the stigma around his quirk he‚Äôs been seen as an outcast and a freak and has been constantly harassed due to the nature of his quirk.)

(The idea I have for this RP is that the girl(s) of class 1-A will help him come out of his shell and accept that his quirk isn‚Äôt the villainous thing that other people have led him on to be. As he becomes more confident his small commands will be able to become longer term commands. There will also be story and action to keep the plot engaging and interesting.)

Starter: It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn‚Äôt last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.

‚ÄúMorning everyone.‚Äù He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôve got a new student transferring in from another school. He‚Äôs from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it‚Äôs got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless make sure he feels welcome.‚Äù He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem child of the U.A class Bakugo.

With that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.

I had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. ‚ÄúMy name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you all.‚Äù I say bowing to the class.

Satisfied with the introduction Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.

Idea 2: One Piece.

(I‚Äôm not so sure how I want to approach this one, however I‚Äôll jump in and give it ago. Much like the MHA starter this character will have the power of Persuasion. Having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I‚Äôm thinking for now either he joins the Straw Hats and goes on adventures with them, or he makes a crew with characters from the story (Obviously this doesn‚Äôt have to be cannon and completely made up as we go. Either way I‚Äôm super keen on this since I love One Piece to death.)

Starter: Adventure! Freedom, Treasure and Booze! These were all the things a pirate needed in life. And exactly what every pirate set out to obtain. Two years after the events at Marineford where Strawhat Luffy himself took on the government with an army behind him, and the Whitebeard Pirates at his side in order to rescue his brother‚Ä¶ And two years since I felt inspired enough in his absence to set forth on my own.

I gathered up a strong crew and made a name for myself. My alias being Silver Tongue Schwarzer, a nice title which rolled off the tongue. I had no issues amassing a sizable bounty at 90 million berries. While it wasn‚Äôt as grand as other pirates, the world government saw enough of a threat in my power to provide a bounty that large.

So then why was I now sitting at a bar on the Sabaody Archipelago, alone and staring into the amber liquid of booze in a mug? It was simple. Mutiny. Those whom I had trusted most among my crew turned on a dime and after reaching the Archipelago they threw me overboard and turned around. To where I didn‚Äôt know and quite frankly after their betrayal I didn‚Äôt care.

‚ÄúDamn them. Damn them all.‚Äù I muttered under my breath cursing as I downed the rest of my contents. ‚ÄúAnother!‚Äù I called out to the barkeep who approached to fill my mug.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking a little rough there, you sure you need another?‚Äù The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything else to do. I don‚Äôt even know what else to do with myself.‚Äù I responded grumpily. ‚ÄúJust fill it up.‚Äù I demanded.

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.

Idea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.

(So I‚Äôve just completed the anime for Jujutsu Kaisen and I really enjoy it. I‚Äôve got an interesting idea for a curse ability, my character‚Äôs power is basically he emits smells. Mostly for support, however his ability is so strong that he‚Äôs unable to turn it off. He always smells great to anyone who smells him, almost like a pheromone. And to demons it‚Äôs a lure. Because of this he wears a lot to cover up his body so he doesn‚Äôt let out as much of his scent. He‚Äôs in Jujutsu now because he wanted to learn how to use different smells for different things and one day he hopes to be able to control his powers. Since the cast is pretty small, feel free to play OC characters for this one as well as canon! :) )

Starter: The sounds of fabric ripping filled the air followed up by my swearing as my scent was released into the air. This was bad. My scent leaking out meant that every cursed spirit within a few blocks would barrel down on my position.

It seemed the time for subtlety was out the window and as such I pulled the large good back and unzipped my jacket which zipped all the way up to cover half my face. Underneath my body was bare. I mean wearing a large coat all day with extra layers was asking to sweat like a pig. I tossed my coat to the side and threw my gloves along with it.

My cursed energy seeped out increasing the potency and the range of my smell. My eyes narrowed at the grade three curse spirit which was staring me down. ‚ÄúSleep.‚Äù I say clapping my hands together as my scent changed to that of a sleep agent.

The cursed spirit swayed a little before collapsing to the ground. My smell even caused me to sway a little as I breathed it in, however I had built up an immunity to it. The sounds of more cursed spirits barreling down on my position could be heard all around me as I grabbed my coat and my gloves and made a run for it into a nearby building. I didn‚Äôt have time to finish the spirit off before I ran into the building. This would be a better place for me to fight them given that my smell could permeate more efficiently than it would in an open space.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if help was going to come, but for now I‚Äôd operate under the assumption that it wasn't.

Idea 4: Fire Force.

(I‚Äôve finished watching Fire force and I love the idea and the characters! Especially Maki! So with that in mind I‚Äôve decided to type up a starter to add to it.. My character will be similar to Shinra in the fact that his flames are speed types, however rather than prolonged speed, he uses his flames to propel his attacks with his legs and hands‚Ä¶ It‚Äôll probably be much clearer when I‚Äôm explaining it in RP.)

Starter: I looked up to the rather run-down looking base of the 8th division of the fire force. It looked rather‚Ä¶ shabby. Although I quickly shook my head. They‚Äôd been nice enough to let me in and I approached the large oak doors gently pushing them aside. Once inside I met with a large mound of muscle. ‚ÄúHm?‚Äù The male grunted curiously. ‚ÄúYou the newbie?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúCaptain Obi.‚Äù The male said as he placed his weight down and extended a muscular arm out to me.

‚ÄúChris Schwarzer.‚Äù I responded as I reached my hand out and shook his own. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù I stated.

Obi smiled as he nodded. ‚ÄúCome with me, I‚Äôll introduce you to the rest of the team.‚Äù He said as he led me down to a noisy room which was lively and when I entered.

‚ÄúAlright you lot listen up. This is Chris Schwarzer, he‚Äôs the new rookie I told you about, and he‚Äôs new around here. So, make sure you make him feel welcome.‚Äù Captain Obi spoke up.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you all.‚Äù I say as I bowed humbly to them all.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get a test on your mettle soon enough kid, once you get the tour and put your bag away. The rest of us will meet us up on the roof.‚Äù He stated and guided me around the grounds of the company 8 base. Soon enough we headed over to the bunk rooms where he opened the door. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your roommate, play nice.‚Äù He said to the figure inside.

‚ÄúOh! Right.‚Äù I say as I bowed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù I stated humbly I wanted to make a good impression on the team after all.

Idea 5: Demon Slayer.

(Recently I went to go see the Mugen train movie and it‚Äôs reignited my love for this series, so I felt the need to include it for sure! This will be open to both OC and canon characters so feel free to jump in as either one! My character will be a member of the demon slayer corps who is on a near impossible mission in a small village.)

Starter: I panted heavily as I clutched at the wound in my right side. My shaking left hand clutched tightly to the hilt of my blade. This mission had been easy to start with, but the reports were wrong. I had also gotten carless and sloppy due to the fact I had been up for three days straight. Something was luring an incredible mass of Demons to this town and I was tasked to find out what‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt know there would be this many. I tried to regulate my breathing and compose myself even though my body felt as though it would give at any moment. In front of me was a horde of demons, and my eyes studied them waiting for any sign of movement among them. Behind me laid a mass of slain demons which had all been decapitated and were in the process of evaporating.

Checking the hand on my side I didn‚Äôt need to look down to feel that it had dampened with blood. I cursed under my breath my thoughts wandering to the possibility that this might be my final fight. I knew that if I made it to dawn which was only a short time away that I might be able to make it, although that was only a thin sliver of hope.

This was a mission that seemed to have no end, and even though I‚Äôd asked for help from HQ I knew it‚Äôd be some time before they got here‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt even sure how long ago that was‚Ä¶ My thoughts questioned if even a Hashira would have problems with this mission.

I had to keep fighting‚Ä¶ fight till there was no life left in me. And as the surge of demons rushed forth once again, I exhaled. Steadying my breathing as the winds around me changed. ‚ÄúFirst form: Dust Whirlwind Cutter‚Äù I called out as I surged forward slicing through the closest demons and giving myself another moment to breathe. However, my feet were shaky and I stumbled slightly. Many of the demons who noticed my weakening form began to laugh almost in a taunting and mocking manner as they stepped towards me once again.

Idea 6: Attack on Titan.

(So this‚Äôll be a run of the mill attack on titan RP. It‚Äôll be action and adventure based. I‚Äôll probably stick to the start of the story right after everyone meets the scouts. Although I think for this RP, I‚Äôll make the scouts different, having a different leader who is a little more corrupt and willing to frugally send troops to their deaths. As for my character I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôll make him a titan shifter or not. Also, if you want to play multiple canon characters that‚Äôs great!)

Starter: There was a solid ‚Äúthunk‚Äù as my hooks embedded themselves into the woody flesh of a tree and I reeled myself onto the branch. I panted heavily as I felt the warm, almost boiling titan‚Äôs blood evaporating from my cheeks and looked down to the corpse of the last titan I‚Äôd killed which was now steaming.

Between heavy breaths of air, I wiped the back of my hand against my forehead wiping away fat beads of sweat and slicked back my ginger hair from my eyes while my blue eyes looked out to the large forest below. It seemed that no matter how many titans were killed more and more kept coming.

‚ÄúDamnit how did I get stuck on this mission?‚Äù I questioned out loud as I tapped on my gas cylinders to feel that they were empty‚Ä¶ not to mention I was down to my last few blades. ‚ÄúDid they really expect us to set up a forward base in this shithole? And just where the hell is the supply unit?‚Äù I speak out loud. A familiar ‚ÄúThunk‚Äù of hooks embedding themselves into wood snapped me from my despairing thoughts.

I looked down to the clearly female form of another scout as she reeled herself towards the sturdy branch I was sitting on and not wanting to scare her if she hadn‚Äôt seen me peeked my head over. ‚ÄúYou need a hand?‚Äù I asked as I reached down my hand to help her up onto the branch.

Idea 7: Fairy Tail

(It‚Äôs been a little while since I‚Äôve seen this series, but I‚Äôve always thought the girls were cute and I loved it! Given my time away from it, I might need some time to refamiliarize myself with how magic works, but I‚Äôm probably going to make him a lot like the character in fire force, a strong/fast attacker who uses fire. He‚Äôll be an entry level member to the guild to begin with.)

Starter: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn‚Äôt part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.

I had only been part of the guild for a couple of weeks and so far, it‚Äôs not been as exciting as I‚Äôd hoped, although I figured that it‚Äôd pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. ‚ÄúSchwarzer my boy!‚Äù He said as he patted me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúHow are you fitting in?‚Äù He questioned.

‚ÄúFine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.‚Äù I say to him in response.

‚ÄúGlad to hear it! You‚Äôve been doing a good job, although I‚Äôd like to see you do more.‚Äù The male said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?‚Äù He questioned.

‚ÄúYes of course!‚Äù I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.

‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù He said cheerfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll introduce you to who you‚Äôll be working with.‚Äù He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.

Idea 8: Naruto

(So for this one I like the idea that my character is a nomadic mercenary from the cloud village who uses lightning release to increase his speed. He is hired by the leaf to help the ninja of the village on a mission, maybe he also has some kind of hidden power that boosts his chakra but also increases his libido. Not too sure how I wanna go about this one.)

Starter: The Hokage Tsunade Senju looked over me with a curious gaze and then down to my application form. I had been summoned to the village for a mission, but I wasn‚Äôt told what other than the fact that the pay was good. The older woman eyed me up with an air of suspicion as she held up the paper before studying my face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre younger than I expected given everything you‚Äôve done.‚Äù She stated honestly. ‚ÄúBut the intelligence division did a thorough search into you and your village. You check out.‚Äù She stated as she slammed the approved stamp down onto my paper.

‚ÄúJust remember, if you do anything to endanger this village, I‚Äôll snuff you out personally.‚Äù She said in an icy and threatening tone. Feeling a cold bead of sweat roll down the side of my face I nodded. ‚ÄúOf course. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of it.‚Äù I say. Internally I make a mental note not to cross her in any way.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù She said putting a smile across her features. ‚ÄúYour team is going to be assembled at the gate by sundown.‚Äù She stated. Here‚Äôs a key to your lodgings at the hotsprings inn.‚Äù She stated as she handed me a key. ‚ÄúMake sure you‚Äôre not late.‚Äù She started with her same warning tone.

I nodded as I took the key and smiled at the woman. ‚ÄúUnderstood, thank you.‚Äù I say as I gathered up my things and headed over to the inn. It was beautiful and the warm air of the hot springs was inviting. Although given that it was late afternoon already, I didn‚Äôt have much time to soak. I unpacked my gear and soon headed through the winding paths of the village reaching the gate as sundown began to set in. There I saw three lone female forms and gave them an awkward smile. ‚ÄúHey guys, I‚Äôm here to help you out on your mission.‚Äù I told them.

Idea 9: Bleach

(So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn‚Äôt captain level to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he‚Äôs paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.)

Starter: Another boring day at college followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by ‚ÄúFull-fledged‚Äù Soul reapers it didn‚Äôt leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.

At least that‚Äôs what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.

It was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see it‚Äôs towering form from my position.

It was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they‚Äôd come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.

Pushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.

When he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt smell like much, but you‚Äôll do as a snack.‚Äù The hollow commented as it charged forward.

‚ÄúJust evade, buy time.‚Äù I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.

The hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature‚Äôs mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating. I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be enough.

Idea 10: Sword Art Online.

(Fairly simple it‚Äôs SAO set in the original death game. I love the idea, so I‚Äôve always loved rping this one. If you want to play canon characters my favorite is for sure Lizbeth, but I‚Äôm open to OC characters!)

Starter: It‚Äôs been months since Akihiko Kayaba has trapped us into this death game. Or at least that‚Äôs how some people looked at it. Others saw it as their dream come true. But most if not, all wanted to push forward and beat the game.

Despite the desire to push forward little progress has been made. Guilds and parties have formed to push through dungeons but with the increased danger and with it more deaths; more and more people simply decided to live out their lives on the lower floors.

Unlike those rushing in to push through the content I was happy enough to go through it at my own pace. This place was like a dream for me, save for the fact I had an increased chance of dying. I was able to live in this game without the worries of the outside world.

I was doing some late-night grinding in an area of dense forest. The sun had set and there was little light save for the bright moon poking through the trees. All was calm, the trees swayed with the wind and the occasional sound of creatures moving about was enough to calm me.

However, the deeper I got into the forest the louder a sound became. At first it was quiet but as I approached, I heard it more clearly. It sounded like steel clashing against steel. Someone was fighting. Moving from a casual walk into a jog I quickly came to a small clearing where I saw two figures fighting, although in the low light I couldn‚Äôt make it out until I got closer.

Idea 11: Avatar the Last Airbender.

(So for this one I guess it can go two different ways. My favorite girls from Avatar would probably be Ty Lee, Suki and Toph. Maybe my character is a powerful bender that either the fire nation or team Avatar wants on their side. I think it might be cool to think that Aang isn‚Äôt the only airbender and instead a small faction managed to escape and continue the lineage. Either that or my character is a powerful firebender of some kind. I‚Äôll leave whichever you prefer to you in your first reply as I‚Äôll leave it open ended.)

Starter: The world was at war ever since the Fire nation attacked. With the intense fighting came mercenaries. Freelance benders or soldiers ready to fight on either side. For a fee of course. And despite my age, being only eighteen I was quite renowned amongst the other bounty hunters for my bending.

Of course, there were talks of the Avatar returning, having repelled an invasion in the south pole, the liberation of Omashu and then the fire nation prison. It seemed they were making quite the stir in the earth kingdom.

It‚Äôd only be a matter of time before they reached the small town, I was in. Perhaps they were already here. But if that was the case surely there would be some kind of stir. Pushing my hair from my face I ordered another drink from the barkeep.

‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre my favourite customer Schwarzer‚Ä¶. You‚Äôre the only one who consistently pays his tab. Unlike the rest of these soldiers or the workers around here.‚Äù The older man says in clear annoyance.

‚ÄúWell who knows, if I wasn‚Äôt so successful, I‚Äôd probably mooch off you too.‚Äù I admitted with a grin. ‚ÄúTry not to talk too ill of the soldiers on either side.‚Äù I added on flicking him an extra coin for a tip once my drink was finished. ‚ÄúWell I better check if anyone has a job for me.‚Äù I say as I push myself up from my seat.

Idea 12: Persona (Girls from 3, 4 and 5).

(So basically this is just gonna be a fairly interesting idea. My character along with the girls of persona 3, 4 and 5 get stranded in this strange dimension where they have to fight their way out to make it back to their own worlds.)

Starter: It all happened so fast. One minute I was in a team meeting with my group discussing what we should use our newfound powers for next. And the next second, I blinked and I was in some kind of strange room.

One by one more people were added into this room. Some of which were dressed in some elaborate costumes. And I frowned as I looked at each one of them, all of which I didn‚Äôt recognize at all and judging by their looks they didn‚Äôt recognize me. Although before we managed to introduce ourselves a booming voice broke the silence.

‚ÄúWelcome all!‚Äù The clearly male voice commented. ‚ÄúTo the room of my design.‚Äù He added on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all confused. And no doubt you‚Äôll want to return back to your homes. However, to do so you‚Äôll need to enter my labyrinth. ‚ÄúMake it to the end and you‚Äôll all return home.‚Äù The voice explained.

‚ÄúOf course, this maze isn‚Äôt without its dangers. Enemies, much like you encounter on a regular basis will roam these halls. As well as beasts of my own design far stronger than those‚Ä¶ Fear not though for every checkpoint you reach this room will become more furnished with amenities. For now, you simply have beds to rest on.‚Äù He said as there was an audible click and the dark room was suddenly lit up. Sure, enough there were rows of beds all lined up one for each person to sleep on.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre ready to test yourself, step through this door and enter the first level of the labyrinth.‚Äù He declared as a large door appeared and opened up in front of them.

For a while nobody said anything, probably all too stunned to even process the information. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre all persona users given what he just said.‚Äù I spoke up. ‚ÄúI guess we should probably start with names and strengths, right?‚Äù I questioned the group. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Chris Schwarzer.‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúMy persona Serapth focuses on ranged combat.‚Äù I explained.

Idea 13: Final Fantasy VII (Others can be done).

(So this one will be set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, however if you‚Äôre looking to do others, I‚Äôm more than happy to do so! But this one will be focused on FF VII, Jessie, Tifa and Aerith are best girls!)

Starter: Midgar. Easy place to find work given you were capable enough. There were a lot of monsters prowling the highways between sectors and a lot of people willing to pay mercenaries to get the job done.

‚ÄúHiyah!‚Äù I called out as I cleaved my blade through the neck of a monster severing its head from the rest of its body and slaying it instantly. It was a tough fight but I overcame it. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. The job I was on was simple, kill the beast and return its head to a barkeep in sector 5. I scooped the beast‚Äôs head up into a burlap sack and hoisted it over my shoulder before I headed back to the bar.

By this point I was a rather well-known mercenary by trade. Job‚Äôs exterminating monsters were easy to come by and easy enough to complete. Plus, the payout paid for my room and for most of my meals. As I entered the bar I headed up to the counter and placed the bloody burlap sack on the counter. ‚ÄúGot it done.‚Äù I say to the barkeep.

The older man, his hair and beard white with age frowned a little and looked at the bag. The blood splatter on the counter‚Ä¶ which he had just cleaned was enough to let him know that I was serious and he placed the sack full of gil on the counter.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I say as I picked up the purse. It was lighter than I expected, but even if it was short I wasn‚Äôt about to start an argument. In return to my manners, I got a short grunt back.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôtcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain‚Äôt want it.‚Äù He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.

‚ÄúRight, I‚Äôll get on that.‚Äù I say as I grabbed the sack.

‚ÄúAn there was a woman lookin for you.‚Äù He stated. ‚ÄúSaid she‚Äôd be waitin for you in buildin next to the orphanage.‚Äù He stated.

‚ÄúRight, thanks.‚Äù I said to the man and headed out, disposing quickly of the severed head in the sack before I headed up to the building in question. I frowned as I peered inside. My eyes looking around for any sign of someone out of place. It did seem a little crowded in the building after all. I was about to announce myself when I felt a hand tap my shoulder and turned to see who it was.

Idea 14: The Witcher 3.

(So my character will be a Witcher. (wow!) Saving people, hunting things you know? The family business. Anyway, I‚Äôm gonna leave it super open ended for you to come in however you like! If you wanna play a canon character my top two are for sure Ciri and Trist, and OC characters are accepted too!)

Starter: A Werewolf, an odd and rare contract, although I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be a hard one. In fact, I figured with my silver blade that the creature would go down rather quickly. Starting the encounter, I was faced with a harsh reality due to my hubris. I started off well enough, however due to my carelessness I was quickly on the backfoot.

The beast roared as it swung its large clawed hand towards me. I had barely managed to roll out of the way of the attack. Probably due to the increasing levels of blood loss resulting in a careless action on my part. A level of confidence quickly pushed down by the fact a handful of open wounds stung at my flanks.

More scars for later given that I make it out of here, although with my silver blade thrown on the other side of the area leaving me with only a steel sword which barely even phases the thing. I had to reach my blade, although with my focus on dodging the attacks it was hard to find an opening to do so.

I raised a hand and cast the igni sign launching flames at the creature who leapt back and I tried my best to make it past the creature only to have to dodge another strike as the beast recovered remarkably fast. ‚ÄúStubborn bastard, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù I questioned a little sourly.

Idea 15: Harry Potter.

(So to keep this one interesting I‚Äôm thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don‚Äôt exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other celebs/ecelebs as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too!)

Starter: Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.

The ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abound about what was really happening.

Stepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn‚Äôt stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.

Glad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs around here somewhere.‚Äù I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.

Closing Words: And that is everything done! If you‚Äôve read this far, I want to give a big thanks! And if you have any questions or suggestions or even criticisms, I‚Äôm open to hearing them. I know this was probably a big read so thanks again for your time and I hope to talk to some of you soon! Also I just want to state it again

Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem.

"[M4A] (A Playing as F) Massive prompt drop of Harem Based Anime and Fandom centric RP prompts. Balance of Smut and Story! (Anime, Rule 34, Fandoms, Games.)","https://imgur.com/a/paxhS5W  
  
Hey guys!  
  
Today I bring you a massive list of RP Ideas that I‚Äôm constantly working on. These posts are mainly around anime I‚Äôve watched or games/Fandoms I‚Äôm in. However, there are some OC based stuff that might be used either way!  
  
For my replies I only write in first person and the length of my replies vary from a few sentences to a few solid paragraphs depending on how much is going on in a scene. I figured I‚Äôd put a fair warning here that if you reply with low detail, I won‚Äôt be rping with you. I‚Äôm not looking for a few words as a response. While that might be your thing, that's fine and power to you! It‚Äôs just not mine.  
  
I‚Äôm someone who likes a nice balance of build-up and story to go along with the smut. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of constant sex, or sex that starts within one or two replies. I also like cute dates and moments, and love to type out action driven moments.  
  
What I look for in a partner:  
  
Third Person responses (Unless you're playing an OC among the harem)  
  
Active - I don't wanna be waiting a week for a reply. I understand if you're busy outside of RP but please let me know so I'm not just waiting around and twiddling my thumbs. If I go a week without hearing from you at all I'm going to assume you're no longer interested.  
  
Communicative: It kinda links in with the other but if you're not feeling the RP or you're busy IRL I'm not gonna get mad or anything I'm an understanding person!  
  
Detailed responses: Anything 2 sentences up to a paragraph is enough, but more is always very much appreciated.  
  
This one is a bit of a nitpick, but Please don't just message me with ""I'll rp"" Or ""want to rp?"" tell me what rps you wanna do in your initial message! If you're undecided please just list the ones you want to do and we can go there. If you do message me like the previous I'll probably just ignore the message.  
  
For the platforms I mainly do rps on Discord, however I also have a kik and my inbox here. So feel free to ask about my user for either platform.  
  
Now to get into the meat and potatoes, I‚Äôll post my kinks and limits. There‚Äôs a lot there and not all of them will be applicable to the starters. As I‚Äôm a massive fan of harems I‚Äôll put this in bold here. Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies.  
  
Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem. (Sorry if that‚Äôs an issue, I still wish you the best!)  
  
Kinks:  
  
Harems ‚Äì (Which doesn‚Äôt mean playing a bunch of characters at once. If you prefer to play 1 character per scene that‚Äôs fine!)  
  
Outercourse (Which is stiff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging, that kinda thing), Risky/public spaces. (Places you can get caught but don‚Äôt. Toilet stalls, changing booths, that kinda thing), Facials, Freckles (Face and body), Big, nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle‚Ä¶ just an overall fan of the jiggle if I‚Äôm honest), Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, thigh high socks, shower/water sex (places like pools, showers, hot tubs that kinda things, and a Mutual desire for sex. Incest. I also don‚Äôt mind pubic hair as long as it‚Äôs not overly bushy trimmed stuff is nice! :)  
  
Limits:  
  
Pregnacy, which also includes lactation (Hard limit, sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, toilet stuff, noncon/rape, Gagnbangs (reverse gangbangs with females is fine), Male on male, Futas, Rimming/pegging. (There could be more that I haven‚Äôt thought of, if you‚Äôre unsure feel free to ask)  
  
There could be more that I might be into, that hasn‚Äôt been listed so feel free to ask about it and we can work something out. And without further ado let‚Äôs head straight into it.  
  
I‚Äôve made an easy access list for you to read through to see if anything piques your interest before you have to scroll through this abundant list. Of course, I stated this before but I‚Äôll state it again.  
  
Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies. Especially canon characters.  
  
Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem. (Sorry if that‚Äôs an issue, I still wish you the best!)

Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.  
  
(So for this one, my character will be a transfer into class 1-A. From Shiketsu. His power is that of Persuasion. With the power he‚Äôs able to convince someone to do something as if it‚Äôs their own free will. That being said he‚Äôs rather hesitant to use it on other people and due to the stigma around his quirk he‚Äôs been seen as an outcast and a freak and has been constantly harassed due to the nature of his quirk.)  
  
(The idea I have for this RP is that the girl(s) of class 1-A will help him come out of his shell and accept that his quirk isn‚Äôt the villainous thing that other people have led him on to be. As he becomes more confident his small commands will be able to become longer term commands. There will also be story and action to keep the plot engaging and interesting.)  
  
Starter: It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn‚Äôt last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.  
  
‚ÄúMorning everyone.‚Äù He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôve got a new student transferring in from another school. He‚Äôs from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it‚Äôs got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless make sure he feels welcome.‚Äù He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem child of the U.A class Bakugo.  
  
With that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.  
  
I had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. ‚ÄúMy name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you all.‚Äù I say bowing to the class.  
  
Satisfied with the introduction Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.  
  
Idea 2: One Piece.  
  
(I‚Äôm not so sure how I want to approach this one, however I‚Äôll jump in and give it ago. Much like the MHA starter this character will have the power of Persuasion. Having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I‚Äôm thinking for now either he joins the Straw Hats and goes on adventures with them, or he makes a crew with characters from the story (Obviously this doesn‚Äôt have to be cannon and completely made up as we go. Either way I‚Äôm super keen on this since I love One Piece to death.)  
  
Starter: Adventure! Freedom, Treasure and Booze! These were all the things a pirate needed in life. And exactly what every pirate set out to obtain. Two years after the events at Marineford where Strawhat Luffy himself took on the government with an army behind him, and the Whitebeard Pirates at his side in order to rescue his brother‚Ä¶ And two years since I felt inspired enough in his absence to set forth on my own.  
  
I gathered up a strong crew and made a name for myself. My alias being Silver Tongue Schwarzer, a nice title which rolled off the tongue. I had no issues amassing a sizable bounty at 90 million berries. While it wasn‚Äôt as grand as other pirates, the world government saw enough of a threat in my power to provide a bounty that large.  
  
So then why was I now sitting at a bar on the Sabaody Archipelago, alone and staring into the amber liquid of booze in a mug? It was simple. Mutiny. Those whom I had trusted most among my crew turned on a dime and after reaching the Archipelago they threw me overboard and turned around. To where I didn‚Äôt know and quite frankly after their betrayal I didn‚Äôt care.  
  
‚ÄúDamn them. Damn them all.‚Äù I muttered under my breath cursing as I downed the rest of my contents. ‚ÄúAnother!‚Äù I called out to the barkeep who approached to fill my mug.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking a little rough there, you sure you need another?‚Äù The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything else to do. I don‚Äôt even know what else to do with myself.‚Äù I responded grumpily. ‚ÄúJust fill it up.‚Äù I demanded.  
  
‚ÄúRight.‚Äù The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.  
  
Idea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.  
  
(So I‚Äôve just completed the anime for Jujutsu Kaisen and I really enjoy it. I‚Äôve got an interesting idea for a curse ability, my character‚Äôs power is basically he emits smells. Mostly for support, however his ability is so strong that he‚Äôs unable to turn it off. He always smells great to anyone who smells him, almost like a pheromone. And to demons it‚Äôs a lure. Because of this he wears a lot to cover up his body so he doesn‚Äôt let out as much of his scent. He‚Äôs in Jujutsu now because he wanted to learn how to use different smells for different things and one day he hopes to be able to control his powers. Since the cast is pretty small, feel free to play OC characters for this one as well as canon! :) )  
  
Starter: The sounds of fabric ripping filled the air followed up by my swearing as my scent was released into the air. This was bad. My scent leaking out meant that every cursed spirit within a few blocks would barrel down on my position.  
  
It seemed the time for subtlety was out the window and as such I pulled the large good back and unzipped my jacket which zipped all the way up to cover half my face. Underneath my body was bare. I mean wearing a large coat all day with extra layers was asking to sweat like a pig. I tossed my coat to the side and threw my gloves along with it.  
  
My cursed energy seeped out increasing the potency and the range of my smell. My eyes narrowed at the grade three curse spirit which was staring me down. ‚ÄúSleep.‚Äù I say clapping my hands together as my scent changed to that of a sleep agent.  
  
The cursed spirit swayed a little before collapsing to the ground. My smell even caused me to sway a little as I breathed it in, however I had built up an immunity to it. The sounds of more cursed spirits barreling down on my position could be heard all around me as I grabbed my coat and my gloves and made a run for it into a nearby building. I didn‚Äôt have time to finish the spirit off before I ran into the building. This would be a better place for me to fight them given that my smell could permeate more efficiently than it would in an open space.  
  
I wasn‚Äôt sure if help was going to come, but for now I‚Äôd operate under the assumption that it wasn't.  
  
Idea 4: Fire Force.  
  
(I‚Äôve finished watching Fire force and I love the idea and the characters! Especially Maki! So with that in mind I‚Äôve decided to type up a starter to add to it.. My character will be similar to Shinra in the fact that his flames are speed types, however rather than prolonged speed, he uses his flames to propel his attacks with his legs and hands‚Ä¶ It‚Äôll probably be much clearer when I‚Äôm explaining it in RP.)  
  
Starter: I looked up to the rather run-down looking base of the 8th division of the fire force. It looked rather‚Ä¶ shabby. Although I quickly shook my head. They‚Äôd been nice enough to let me in and I approached the large oak doors gently pushing them aside. Once inside I met with a large mound of muscle. ‚ÄúHm?‚Äù The male grunted curiously. ‚ÄúYou the newbie?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúCaptain Obi.‚Äù The male said as he placed his weight down and extended a muscular arm out to me.  
  
‚ÄúChris Schwarzer.‚Äù I responded as I reached my hand out and shook his own. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù I stated.  
  
Obi smiled as he nodded. ‚ÄúCome with me, I‚Äôll introduce you to the rest of the team.‚Äù He said as he led me down to a noisy room which was lively and when I entered.  
  
‚ÄúAlright you lot listen up. This is Chris Schwarzer, he‚Äôs the new rookie I told you about, and he‚Äôs new around here. So, make sure you make him feel welcome.‚Äù Captain Obi spoke up.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you all.‚Äù I say as I bowed humbly to them all.  
  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get a test on your mettle soon enough kid, once you get the tour and put your bag away. The rest of us will meet us up on the roof.‚Äù He stated and guided me around the grounds of the company 8 base. Soon enough we headed over to the bunk rooms where he opened the door. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your roommate, play nice.‚Äù He said to the figure inside.  
  
‚ÄúOh! Right.‚Äù I say as I bowed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù I stated humbly I wanted to make a good impression on the team after all.  
  
Idea 5: Demon Slayer.  
  
(Recently I went to go see the Mugen train movie and it‚Äôs reignited my love for this series, so I felt the need to include it for sure! This will be open to both OC and canon characters so feel free to jump in as either one! My character will be a member of the demon slayer corps who is on a near impossible mission in a small village.)  
  
Starter: I panted heavily as I clutched at the wound in my right side. My shaking left hand clutched tightly to the hilt of my blade. This mission had been easy to start with, but the reports were wrong. I had also gotten carless and sloppy due to the fact I had been up for three days straight. Something was luring an incredible mass of Demons to this town and I was tasked to find out what‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt know there would be this many. I tried to regulate my breathing and compose myself even though my body felt as though it would give at any moment. In front of me was a horde of demons, and my eyes studied them waiting for any sign of movement among them. Behind me laid a mass of slain demons which had all been decapitated and were in the process of evaporating.  
  
Checking the hand on my side I didn‚Äôt need to look down to feel that it had dampened with blood. I cursed under my breath my thoughts wandering to the possibility that this might be my final fight. I knew that if I made it to dawn which was only a short time away that I might be able to make it, although that was only a thin sliver of hope.  
  
This was a mission that seemed to have no end, and even though I‚Äôd asked for help from HQ I knew it‚Äôd be some time before they got here‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt even sure how long ago that was‚Ä¶ My thoughts questioned if even a Hashira would have problems with this mission.  
  
I had to keep fighting‚Ä¶ fight till there was no life left in me. And as the surge of demons rushed forth once again, I exhaled. Steadying my breathing as the winds around me changed. ‚ÄúFirst form: Dust Whirlwind Cutter‚Äù I called out as I surged forward slicing through the closest demons and giving myself another moment to breathe. However, my feet were shaky and I stumbled slightly. Many of the demons who noticed my weakening form began to laugh almost in a taunting and mocking manner as they stepped towards me once again.  
  
Idea 6: Attack on Titan.  
  
(So this‚Äôll be a run of the mill attack on titan RP. It‚Äôll be action and adventure based. I‚Äôll probably stick to the start of the story right after everyone meets the scouts. Although I think for this RP, I‚Äôll make the scouts different, having a different leader who is a little more corrupt and willing to frugally send troops to their deaths. As for my character I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôll make him a titan shifter or not. Also, if you want to play multiple canon characters that‚Äôs great!)  
  
Starter: There was a solid ‚Äúthunk‚Äù as my hooks embedded themselves into the woody flesh of a tree and I reeled myself onto the branch. I panted heavily as I felt the warm, almost boiling titan‚Äôs blood evaporating from my cheeks and looked down to the corpse of the last titan I‚Äôd killed which was now steaming.  
  
Between heavy breaths of air, I wiped the back of my hand against my forehead wiping away fat beads of sweat and slicked back my ginger hair from my eyes while my blue eyes looked out to the large forest below. It seemed that no matter how many titans were killed more and more kept coming.  
  
‚ÄúDamnit how did I get stuck on this mission?‚Äù I questioned out loud as I tapped on my gas cylinders to feel that they were empty‚Ä¶ not to mention I was down to my last few blades. ‚ÄúDid they really expect us to set up a forward base in this shithole? And just where the hell is the supply unit?‚Äù I speak out loud. A familiar ‚ÄúThunk‚Äù of hooks embedding themselves into wood snapped me from my despairing thoughts.  
  
I looked down to the clearly female form of another scout as she reeled herself towards the sturdy branch I was sitting on and not wanting to scare her if she hadn‚Äôt seen me peeked my head over. ‚ÄúYou need a hand?‚Äù I asked as I reached down my hand to help her up onto the branch.  
  
Idea 7: Fairy Tail  
  
(It‚Äôs been a little while since I‚Äôve seen this series, but I‚Äôve always thought the girls were cute and I loved it! Given my time away from it, I might need some time to refamiliarize myself with how magic works, but I‚Äôm probably going to make him a lot like the character in fire force, a strong/fast attacker who uses fire. He‚Äôll be an entry level member to the guild to begin with.)  
  
Starter: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn‚Äôt part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.  
  
I had only been part of the guild for a couple of weeks and so far, it‚Äôs not been as exciting as I‚Äôd hoped, although I figured that it‚Äôd pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. ‚ÄúSchwarzer my boy!‚Äù He said as he patted me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúHow are you fitting in?‚Äù He questioned.  
  
‚ÄúFine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.‚Äù I say to him in response.  
  
‚ÄúGlad to hear it! You‚Äôve been doing a good job, although I‚Äôd like to see you do more.‚Äù The male said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?‚Äù He questioned.  
  
‚ÄúYes of course!‚Äù I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.  
  
‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù He said cheerfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll introduce you to who you‚Äôll be working with.‚Äù He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.  
  
Idea 8: Naruto  
  
(So for this one I like the idea that my character is a nomadic mercenary from the cloud village who uses lightning release to increase his speed. He is hired by the leaf to help the ninja of the village on a mission, maybe he also has some kind of hidden power that boosts his chakra but also increases his libido. Not too sure how I wanna go about this one.)  
  
Starter: The Hokage Tsunade Senju looked over me with a curious gaze and then down to my application form. I had been summoned to the village for a mission, but I wasn‚Äôt told what other than the fact that the pay was good. The older woman eyed me up with an air of suspicion as she held up the paper before studying my face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre younger than I expected given everything you‚Äôve done.‚Äù She stated honestly. ‚ÄúBut the intelligence division did a thorough search into you and your village. You check out.‚Äù She stated as she slammed the approved stamp down onto my paper.  
  
‚ÄúJust remember, if you do anything to endanger this village, I‚Äôll snuff you out personally.‚Äù She said in an icy and threatening tone. Feeling a cold bead of sweat roll down the side of my face I nodded. ‚ÄúOf course. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of it.‚Äù I say. Internally I make a mental note not to cross her in any way.  
  
‚ÄúGood.‚Äù She said putting a smile across her features. ‚ÄúYour team is going to be assembled at the gate by sundown.‚Äù She stated. Here‚Äôs a key to your lodgings at the hotsprings inn.‚Äù She stated as she handed me a key. ‚ÄúMake sure you‚Äôre not late.‚Äù She started with her same warning tone.  
  
I nodded as I took the key and smiled at the woman. ‚ÄúUnderstood, thank you.‚Äù I say as I gathered up my things and headed over to the inn. It was beautiful and the warm air of the hot springs was inviting. Although given that it was late afternoon already, I didn‚Äôt have much time to soak. I unpacked my gear and soon headed through the winding paths of the village reaching the gate as sundown began to set in. There I saw three lone female forms and gave them an awkward smile. ‚ÄúHey guys, I‚Äôm here to help you out on your mission.‚Äù I told them.  
  
Idea 9: Bleach  
  
(So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn‚Äôt captain level to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he‚Äôs paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.)  
  
Starter: Another boring day at college followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by ‚ÄúFull-fledged‚Äù Soul reapers it didn‚Äôt leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.  
  
At least that‚Äôs what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.  
  
It was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see it‚Äôs towering form from my position.  
  
It was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they‚Äôd come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.  
  
Pushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.  
  
When he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt smell like much, but you‚Äôll do as a snack.‚Äù The hollow commented as it charged forward.  
  
‚ÄúJust evade, buy time.‚Äù I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.  
  
The hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature‚Äôs mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating. I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be enough.  
  
Idea 10: Sword Art Online.  
  
(Fairly simple it‚Äôs SAO set in the original death game. I love the idea, so I‚Äôve always loved rping this one. If you want to play canon characters my favorite is for sure Lizbeth, but I‚Äôm open to OC characters!)  
  
Starter: It‚Äôs been months since Akihiko Kayaba has trapped us into this death game. Or at least that‚Äôs how some people looked at it. Others saw it as their dream come true. But most if not, all wanted to push forward and beat the game.  
  
Despite the desire to push forward little progress has been made. Guilds and parties have formed to push through dungeons but with the increased danger and with it more deaths; more and more people simply decided to live out their lives on the lower floors.  
  
Unlike those rushing in to push through the content I was happy enough to go through it at my own pace. This place was like a dream for me, save for the fact I had an increased chance of dying. I was able to live in this game without the worries of the outside world.  
  
I was doing some late-night grinding in an area of dense forest. The sun had set and there was little light save for the bright moon poking through the trees. All was calm, the trees swayed with the wind and the occasional sound of creatures moving about was enough to calm me.  
  
However, the deeper I got into the forest the louder a sound became. At first it was quiet but as I approached, I heard it more clearly. It sounded like steel clashing against steel. Someone was fighting. Moving from a casual walk into a jog I quickly came to a small clearing where I saw two figures fighting, although in the low light I couldn‚Äôt make it out until I got closer.  
  
Idea 11: Avatar the Last Airbender.  
  
(So for this one I guess it can go two different ways. My favorite girls from Avatar would probably be Ty Lee, Suki and Toph. Maybe my character is a powerful bender that either the fire nation or team Avatar wants on their side. I think it might be cool to think that Aang isn‚Äôt the only airbender and instead a small faction managed to escape and continue the lineage. Either that or my character is a powerful firebender of some kind. I‚Äôll leave whichever you prefer to you in your first reply as I‚Äôll leave it open ended.)  
  
Starter: The world was at war ever since the Fire nation attacked. With the intense fighting came mercenaries. Freelance benders or soldiers ready to fight on either side. For a fee of course. And despite my age, being only eighteen I was quite renowned amongst the other bounty hunters for my bending.  
  
Of course, there were talks of the Avatar returning, having repelled an invasion in the south pole, the liberation of Omashu and then the fire nation prison. It seemed they were making quite the stir in the earth kingdom.  
  
It‚Äôd only be a matter of time before they reached the small town, I was in. Perhaps they were already here. But if that was the case surely there would be some kind of stir. Pushing my hair from my face I ordered another drink from the barkeep.  
  
‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre my favourite customer Schwarzer‚Ä¶. You‚Äôre the only one who consistently pays his tab. Unlike the rest of these soldiers or the workers around here.‚Äù The older man says in clear annoyance.  
  
‚ÄúWell who knows, if I wasn‚Äôt so successful, I‚Äôd probably mooch off you too.‚Äù I admitted with a grin. ‚ÄúTry not to talk too ill of the soldiers on either side.‚Äù I added on flicking him an extra coin for a tip once my drink was finished. ‚ÄúWell I better check if anyone has a job for me.‚Äù I say as I push myself up from my seat.  
  
Idea 12: Persona (Girls from 3, 4 and 5).  
  
(So basically this is just gonna be a fairly interesting idea. My character along with the girls of persona 3, 4 and 5 get stranded in this strange dimension where they have to fight their way out to make it back to their own worlds.)  
  
Starter: It all happened so fast. One minute I was in a team meeting with my group discussing what we should use our newfound powers for next. And the next second, I blinked and I was in some kind of strange room.  
  
One by one more people were added into this room. Some of which were dressed in some elaborate costumes. And I frowned as I looked at each one of them, all of which I didn‚Äôt recognize at all and judging by their looks they didn‚Äôt recognize me. Although before we managed to introduce ourselves a booming voice broke the silence.  
  
‚ÄúWelcome all!‚Äù The clearly male voice commented. ‚ÄúTo the room of my design.‚Äù He added on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all confused. And no doubt you‚Äôll want to return back to your homes. However, to do so you‚Äôll need to enter my labyrinth. ‚ÄúMake it to the end and you‚Äôll all return home.‚Äù The voice explained.  
  
‚ÄúOf course, this maze isn‚Äôt without its dangers. Enemies, much like you encounter on a regular basis will roam these halls. As well as beasts of my own design far stronger than those‚Ä¶ Fear not though for every checkpoint you reach this room will become more furnished with amenities. For now, you simply have beds to rest on.‚Äù He said as there was an audible click and the dark room was suddenly lit up. Sure, enough there were rows of beds all lined up one for each person to sleep on.  
  
‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre ready to test yourself, step through this door and enter the first level of the labyrinth.‚Äù He declared as a large door appeared and opened up in front of them.  
  
For a while nobody said anything, probably all too stunned to even process the information. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre all persona users given what he just said.‚Äù I spoke up. ‚ÄúI guess we should probably start with names and strengths, right?‚Äù I questioned the group. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Chris Schwarzer.‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúMy persona Serapth focuses on ranged combat.‚Äù I explained.  
  
Idea 13: Final Fantasy VII (Others can be done).  
  
(So this one will be set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, however if you‚Äôre looking to do others, I‚Äôm more than happy to do so! But this one will be focused on FF VII, Jessie, Tifa and Aerith are best girls!)  
  
Starter: Midgar. Easy place to find work given you were capable enough. There were a lot of monsters prowling the highways between sectors and a lot of people willing to pay mercenaries to get the job done.  
  
‚ÄúHiyah!‚Äù I called out as I cleaved my blade through the neck of a monster severing its head from the rest of its body and slaying it instantly. It was a tough fight but I overcame it. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. The job I was on was simple, kill the beast and return its head to a barkeep in sector 5. I scooped the beast‚Äôs head up into a burlap sack and hoisted it over my shoulder before I headed back to the bar.  
  
By this point I was a rather well-known mercenary by trade. Job‚Äôs exterminating monsters were easy to come by and easy enough to complete. Plus, the payout paid for my room and for most of my meals. As I entered the bar I headed up to the counter and placed the bloody burlap sack on the counter. ‚ÄúGot it done.‚Äù I say to the barkeep.  
  
The older man, his hair and beard white with age frowned a little and looked at the bag. The blood splatter on the counter‚Ä¶ which he had just cleaned was enough to let him know that I was serious and he placed the sack full of gil on the counter.  
  
‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I say as I picked up the purse. It was lighter than I expected, but even if it was short I wasn‚Äôt about to start an argument. In return to my manners, I got a short grunt back.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôtcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain‚Äôt want it.‚Äù He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.  
  
‚ÄúRight, I‚Äôll get on that.‚Äù I say as I grabbed the sack.  
  
‚ÄúAn there was a woman lookin for you.‚Äù He stated. ‚ÄúSaid she‚Äôd be waitin for you in buildin next to the orphanage.‚Äù He stated.  
  
‚ÄúRight, thanks.‚Äù I said to the man and headed out, disposing quickly of the severed head in the sack before I headed up to the building in question. I frowned as I peered inside. My eyes looking around for any sign of someone out of place. It did seem a little crowded in the building after all. I was about to announce myself when I felt a hand tap my shoulder and turned to see who it was.  
  
Idea 14: The Witcher 3.  
  
(So my character will be a Witcher. (wow!) Saving people, hunting things you know? The family business. Anyway, I‚Äôm gonna leave it super open ended for you to come in however you like! If you wanna play a canon character my top two are for sure Ciri and Trist, and OC characters are accepted too!)  
  
Starter: A Werewolf, an odd and rare contract, although I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be a hard one. In fact, I figured with my silver blade that the creature would go down rather quickly. Starting the encounter, I was faced with a harsh reality due to my hubris. I started off well enough, however due to my carelessness I was quickly on the backfoot.  
  
The beast roared as it swung its large clawed hand towards me. I had barely managed to roll out of the way of the attack. Probably due to the increasing levels of blood loss resulting in a careless action on my part. A level of confidence quickly pushed down by the fact a handful of open wounds stung at my flanks.  
  
More scars for later given that I make it out of here, although with my silver blade thrown on the other side of the area leaving me with only a steel sword which barely even phases the thing. I had to reach my blade, although with my focus on dodging the attacks it was hard to find an opening to do so.  
  
I raised a hand and cast the igni sign launching flames at the creature who leapt back and I tried my best to make it past the creature only to have to dodge another strike as the beast recovered remarkably fast. ‚ÄúStubborn bastard, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù I questioned a little sourly.  
  
Idea 15: Harry Potter.  
  
(So to keep this one interesting I‚Äôm thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don‚Äôt exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other celebs/ecelebs as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too!)  
  
Starter: Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.  
  
The ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abound about what was really happening.  
  
Stepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn‚Äôt stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.  
  
Glad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs around here somewhere.‚Äù I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.  
  
Closing Words: And that is everything done! If you‚Äôve read this far, I want to give a big thanks! And if you have any questions or suggestions or even criticisms, I‚Äôm open to hearing them. I know this was probably a big read so thanks again for your time and I hope to talk to some of you soon! Also I just want to state it again  
  
Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem. (Sorry if that‚Äôs an issue, I still wish you the best!)",SexRoleplay,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexRoleplay/comments/pdcu1k/m4a_a_playing_as_f_massive_prompt_drop_of_harem/,M4A,StrifeERP,pdcu1k,/r/SexRoleplay/comments/pdcu1k/m4a_a_playing_as_f_massive_prompt_drop_of_harem/,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexRoleplay/comments/pdcu1k/m4a_a_playing_as_f_massive_prompt_drop_of_harem/,0,2021-08-28
"[M4A] (A Playing as F) Massive prompt drop of Harem Based Anime and Fandom centric RP prompts. Balance of Smut and Story! (Anime, Rule 34, Fandoms, Games.)","https://imgur.com/a/paxhS5W  
  
Hey guys!  
  
Today I bring you a massive list of RP Ideas that I‚Äôm constantly working on. These posts are mainly around anime I‚Äôve watched or games/Fandoms I‚Äôm in. However, there are some OC based stuff that might be used either way!  
  
For my replies I only write in first person and the length of my replies vary from a few sentences to a few solid paragraphs depending on how much is going on in a scene. I figured I‚Äôd put a fair warning here that if you reply with low detail, I won‚Äôt be rping with you. I‚Äôm not looking for a few words as a response. While that might be your thing, that's fine and power to you! It‚Äôs just not mine.  
  
I‚Äôm someone who likes a nice balance of build-up and story to go along with the smut. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of constant sex, or sex that starts within one or two replies. I also like cute dates and moments, and love to type out action driven moments.  
  
What I look for in a partner:  
  
Third Person responses (Unless you're playing an OC among the harem)  
  
Active - I don't wanna be waiting a week for a reply. I understand if you're busy outside of RP but please let me know so I'm not just waiting around and twiddling my thumbs. If I go a week without hearing from you at all I'm going to assume you're no longer interested.  
  
Communicative: It kinda links in with the other but if you're not feeling the RP or you're busy IRL I'm not gonna get mad or anything I'm an understanding person!  
  
Detailed responses: Anything 2 sentences up to a paragraph is enough, but more is always very much appreciated.  
  
This one is a bit of a nitpick, but Please don't just message me with ""I'll rp"" Or ""want to rp?"" tell me what rps you wanna do in your initial message! If you're undecided please just list the ones you want to do and we can go there. If you do message me like the previous I'll probably just ignore the message.  
  
For the platforms I mainly do rps on Discord, however I also have a kik and my inbox here. So feel free to ask about my user for either platform.  
  
Now to get into the meat and potatoes, I‚Äôll post my kinks and limits. There‚Äôs a lot there and not all of them will be applicable to the starters. As I‚Äôm a massive fan of harems I‚Äôll put this in bold here. Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies.  
  
Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem. (Sorry if that‚Äôs an issue, I still wish you the best!)  
  
Kinks:  
  
Harems ‚Äì (Which doesn‚Äôt mean playing a bunch of characters at once. If you prefer to play 1 character per scene that‚Äôs fine!)  
  
Outercourse (Which is stiff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging, that kinda thing), Risky/public spaces. (Places you can get caught but don‚Äôt. Toilet stalls, changing booths, that kinda thing), Facials, Freckles (Face and body), Big, nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle‚Ä¶ just an overall fan of the jiggle if I‚Äôm honest), Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, thigh high socks, shower/water sex (places like pools, showers, hot tubs that kinda things, and a Mutual desire for sex. Incest. I also don‚Äôt mind pubic hair as long as it‚Äôs not overly bushy trimmed stuff is nice! :)  
  
Limits:  
  
Pregnacy, which also includes lactation (Hard limit, sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, toilet stuff, noncon/rape, Gagnbangs (reverse gangbangs with females is fine), Male on male, Futas, Rimming/pegging. (There could be more that I haven‚Äôt thought of, if you‚Äôre unsure feel free to ask)  
  
There could be more that I might be into, that hasn‚Äôt been listed so feel free to ask about it and we can work something out. And without further ado let‚Äôs head straight into it.  
  
I‚Äôve made an easy access list for you to read through to see if anything piques your interest before you have to scroll through this abundant list. Of course, I stated this before but I‚Äôll state it again.  
  
Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies. Especially canon characters.

Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.  
  
(So for this one, my character will be a transfer into class 1-A. From Shiketsu. His power is that of Persuasion. With the power he‚Äôs able to convince someone to do something as if it‚Äôs their own free will. That being said he‚Äôs rather hesitant to use it on other people and due to the stigma around his quirk he‚Äôs been seen as an outcast and a freak and has been constantly harassed due to the nature of his quirk.)  
  
(The idea I have for this RP is that the girl(s) of class 1-A will help him come out of his shell and accept that his quirk isn‚Äôt the villainous thing that other people have led him on to be. As he becomes more confident his small commands will be able to become longer term commands. There will also be story and action to keep the plot engaging and interesting.)  
  
Starter: It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn‚Äôt last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.  
  
‚ÄúMorning everyone.‚Äù He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôve got a new student transferring in from another school. He‚Äôs from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it‚Äôs got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless make sure he feels welcome.‚Äù He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem child of the U.A class Bakugo.  
  
With that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.  
  
I had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. ‚ÄúMy name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you all.‚Äù I say bowing to the class.  
  
Satisfied with the introduction Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.  
  
Idea 2: One Piece.  
  
(I‚Äôm not so sure how I want to approach this one, however I‚Äôll jump in and give it ago. Much like the MHA starter this character will have the power of Persuasion. Having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I‚Äôm thinking for now either he joins the Straw Hats and goes on adventures with them, or he makes a crew with characters from the story (Obviously this doesn‚Äôt have to be cannon and completely made up as we go. Either way I‚Äôm super keen on this since I love One Piece to death.)  
  
Starter: Adventure! Freedom, Treasure and Booze! These were all the things a pirate needed in life. And exactly what every pirate set out to obtain. Two years after the events at Marineford where Strawhat Luffy himself took on the government with an army behind him, and the Whitebeard Pirates at his side in order to rescue his brother‚Ä¶ And two years since I felt inspired enough in his absence to set forth on my own.  
  
I gathered up a strong crew and made a name for myself. My alias being Silver Tongue Schwarzer, a nice title which rolled off the tongue. I had no issues amassing a sizable bounty at 90 million berries. While it wasn‚Äôt as grand as other pirates, the world government saw enough of a threat in my power to provide a bounty that large.  
  
So then why was I now sitting at a bar on the Sabaody Archipelago, alone and staring into the amber liquid of booze in a mug? It was simple. Mutiny. Those whom I had trusted most among my crew turned on a dime and after reaching the Archipelago they threw me overboard and turned around. To where I didn‚Äôt know and quite frankly after their betrayal I didn‚Äôt care.  
  
‚ÄúDamn them. Damn them all.‚Äù I muttered under my breath cursing as I downed the rest of my contents. ‚ÄúAnother!‚Äù I called out to the barkeep who approached to fill my mug.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking a little rough there, you sure you need another?‚Äù The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything else to do. I don‚Äôt even know what else to do with myself.‚Äù I responded grumpily. ‚ÄúJust fill it up.‚Äù I demanded.  
  
‚ÄúRight.‚Äù The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.  
  
Idea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.  
  
(So I‚Äôve just completed the anime for Jujutsu Kaisen and I really enjoy it. I‚Äôve got an interesting idea for a curse ability, my character‚Äôs power is basically he emits smells. Mostly for support, however his ability is so strong that he‚Äôs unable to turn it off. He always smells great to anyone who smells him, almost like a pheromone. And to demons it‚Äôs a lure. Because of this he wears a lot to cover up his body so he doesn‚Äôt let out as much of his scent. He‚Äôs in Jujutsu now because he wanted to learn how to use different smells for different things and one day he hopes to be able to control his powers. Since the cast is pretty small, feel free to play OC characters for this one as well as canon! :) )  
  
Starter: The sounds of fabric ripping filled the air followed up by my swearing as my scent was released into the air. This was bad. My scent leaking out meant that every cursed spirit within a few blocks would barrel down on my position.  
  
It seemed the time for subtlety was out the window and as such I pulled the large good back and unzipped my jacket which zipped all the way up to cover half my face. Underneath my body was bare. I mean wearing a large coat all day with extra layers was asking to sweat like a pig. I tossed my coat to the side and threw my gloves along with it.  
  
My cursed energy seeped out increasing the potency and the range of my smell. My eyes narrowed at the grade three curse spirit which was staring me down. ‚ÄúSleep.‚Äù I say clapping my hands together as my scent changed to that of a sleep agent.  
  
The cursed spirit swayed a little before collapsing to the ground. My smell even caused me to sway a little as I breathed it in, however I had built up an immunity to it. The sounds of more cursed spirits barreling down on my position could be heard all around me as I grabbed my coat and my gloves and made a run for it into a nearby building. I didn‚Äôt have time to finish the spirit off before I ran into the building. This would be a better place for me to fight them given that my smell could permeate more efficiently than it would in an open space.  
  
I wasn‚Äôt sure if help was going to come, but for now I‚Äôd operate under the assumption that it wasn't.  
  
Idea 4: Fire Force.  
  
(I‚Äôve finished watching Fire force and I love the idea and the characters! Especially Maki! So with that in mind I‚Äôve decided to type up a starter to add to it.. My character will be similar to Shinra in the fact that his flames are speed types, however rather than prolonged speed, he uses his flames to propel his attacks with his legs and hands‚Ä¶ It‚Äôll probably be much clearer when I‚Äôm explaining it in RP.)  
  
Starter: I looked up to the rather run-down looking base of the 8th division of the fire force. It looked rather‚Ä¶ shabby. Although I quickly shook my head. They‚Äôd been nice enough to let me in and I approached the large oak doors gently pushing them aside. Once inside I met with a large mound of muscle. ‚ÄúHm?‚Äù The male grunted curiously. ‚ÄúYou the newbie?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúCaptain Obi.‚Äù The male said as he placed his weight down and extended a muscular arm out to me.  
  
‚ÄúChris Schwarzer.‚Äù I responded as I reached my hand out and shook his own. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù I stated.  
  
Obi smiled as he nodded. ‚ÄúCome with me, I‚Äôll introduce you to the rest of the team.‚Äù He said as he led me down to a noisy room which was lively and when I entered.  
  
‚ÄúAlright you lot listen up. This is Chris Schwarzer, he‚Äôs the new rookie I told you about, and he‚Äôs new around here. So, make sure you make him feel welcome.‚Äù Captain Obi spoke up.  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you all.‚Äù I say as I bowed humbly to them all.  
  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get a test on your mettle soon enough kid, once you get the tour and put your bag away. The rest of us will meet us up on the roof.‚Äù He stated and guided me around the grounds of the company 8 base. Soon enough we headed over to the bunk rooms where he opened the door. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your roommate, play nice.‚Äù He said to the figure inside.  
  
‚ÄúOh! Right.‚Äù I say as I bowed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù I stated humbly I wanted to make a good impression on the team after all.  
  
Idea 5: Demon Slayer.  
  
(Recently I went to go see the Mugen train movie and it‚Äôs reignited my love for this series, so I felt the need to include it for sure! This will be open to both OC and canon characters so feel free to jump in as either one! My character will be a member of the demon slayer corps who is on a near impossible mission in a small village.)  
  
Starter: I panted heavily as I clutched at the wound in my right side. My shaking left hand clutched tightly to the hilt of my blade. This mission had been easy to start with, but the reports were wrong. I had also gotten carless and sloppy due to the fact I had been up for three days straight. Something was luring an incredible mass of Demons to this town and I was tasked to find out what‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt know there would be this many. I tried to regulate my breathing and compose myself even though my body felt as though it would give at any moment. In front of me was a horde of demons, and my eyes studied them waiting for any sign of movement among them. Behind me laid a mass of slain demons which had all been decapitated and were in the process of evaporating.  
  
Checking the hand on my side I didn‚Äôt need to look down to feel that it had dampened with blood. I cursed under my breath my thoughts wandering to the possibility that this might be my final fight. I knew that if I made it to dawn which was only a short time away that I might be able to make it, although that was only a thin sliver of hope.  
  
This was a mission that seemed to have no end, and even though I‚Äôd asked for help from HQ I knew it‚Äôd be some time before they got here‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt even sure how long ago that was‚Ä¶ My thoughts questioned if even a Hashira would have problems with this mission.  
  
I had to keep fighting‚Ä¶ fight till there was no life left in me. And as the surge of demons rushed forth once again, I exhaled. Steadying my breathing as the winds around me changed. ‚ÄúFirst form: Dust Whirlwind Cutter‚Äù I called out as I surged forward slicing through the closest demons and giving myself another moment to breathe. However, my feet were shaky and I stumbled slightly. Many of the demons who noticed my weakening form began to laugh almost in a taunting and mocking manner as they stepped towards me once again.  
  
Idea 6: Attack on Titan.  
  
(So this‚Äôll be a run of the mill attack on titan RP. It‚Äôll be action and adventure based. I‚Äôll probably stick to the start of the story right after everyone meets the scouts. Although I think for this RP, I‚Äôll make the scouts different, having a different leader who is a little more corrupt and willing to frugally send troops to their deaths. As for my character I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôll make him a titan shifter or not. Also, if you want to play multiple canon characters that‚Äôs great!)  
  
Starter: There was a solid ‚Äúthunk‚Äù as my hooks embedded themselves into the woody flesh of a tree and I reeled myself onto the branch. I panted heavily as I felt the warm, almost boiling titan‚Äôs blood evaporating from my cheeks and looked down to the corpse of the last titan I‚Äôd killed which was now steaming.  
  
Between heavy breaths of air, I wiped the back of my hand against my forehead wiping away fat beads of sweat and slicked back my ginger hair from my eyes while my blue eyes looked out to the large forest below. It seemed that no matter how many titans were killed more and more kept coming.  
  
‚ÄúDamnit how did I get stuck on this mission?‚Äù I questioned out loud as I tapped on my gas cylinders to feel that they were empty‚Ä¶ not to mention I was down to my last few blades. ‚ÄúDid they really expect us to set up a forward base in this shithole? And just where the hell is the supply unit?‚Äù I speak out loud. A familiar ‚ÄúThunk‚Äù of hooks embedding themselves into wood snapped me from my despairing thoughts.  
  
I looked down to the clearly female form of another scout as she reeled herself towards the sturdy branch I was sitting on and not wanting to scare her if she hadn‚Äôt seen me peeked my head over. ‚ÄúYou need a hand?‚Äù I asked as I reached down my hand to help her up onto the branch.  
  
Idea 7: Fairy Tail  
  
(It‚Äôs been a little while since I‚Äôve seen this series, but I‚Äôve always thought the girls were cute and I loved it! Given my time away from it, I might need some time to refamiliarize myself with how magic works, but I‚Äôm probably going to make him a lot like the character in fire force, a strong/fast attacker who uses fire. He‚Äôll be an entry level member to the guild to begin with.)  
  
Starter: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn‚Äôt part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.  
  
I had only been part of the guild for a couple of weeks and so far, it‚Äôs not been as exciting as I‚Äôd hoped, although I figured that it‚Äôd pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. ‚ÄúSchwarzer my boy!‚Äù He said as he patted me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúHow are you fitting in?‚Äù He questioned.  
  
‚ÄúFine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.‚Äù I say to him in response.  
  
‚ÄúGlad to hear it! You‚Äôve been doing a good job, although I‚Äôd like to see you do more.‚Äù The male said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?‚Äù He questioned.  
  
‚ÄúYes of course!‚Äù I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.  
  
‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù He said cheerfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll introduce you to who you‚Äôll be working with.‚Äù He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.  
  
Idea 8: Naruto  
  
(So for this one I like the idea that my character is a nomadic mercenary from the cloud village who uses lightning release to increase his speed. He is hired by the leaf to help the ninja of the village on a mission, maybe he also has some kind of hidden power that boosts his chakra but also increases his libido. Not too sure how I wanna go about this one.)  
  
Starter: The Hokage Tsunade Senju looked over me with a curious gaze and then down to my application form. I had been summoned to the village for a mission, but I wasn‚Äôt told what other than the fact that the pay was good. The older woman eyed me up with an air of suspicion as she held up the paper before studying my face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre younger than I expected given everything you‚Äôve done.‚Äù She stated honestly. ‚ÄúBut the intelligence division did a thorough search into you and your village. You check out.‚Äù She stated as she slammed the approved stamp down onto my paper.  
  
‚ÄúJust remember, if you do anything to endanger this village, I‚Äôll snuff you out personally.‚Äù She said in an icy and threatening tone. Feeling a cold bead of sweat roll down the side of my face I nodded. ‚ÄúOf course. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of it.‚Äù I say. Internally I make a mental note not to cross her in any way.  
  
‚ÄúGood.‚Äù She said putting a smile across her features. ‚ÄúYour team is going to be assembled at the gate by sundown.‚Äù She stated. Here‚Äôs a key to your lodgings at the hotsprings inn.‚Äù She stated as she handed me a key. ‚ÄúMake sure you‚Äôre not late.‚Äù She started with her same warning tone.  
  
I nodded as I took the key and smiled at the woman. ‚ÄúUnderstood, thank you.‚Äù I say as I gathered up my things and headed over to the inn. It was beautiful and the warm air of the hot springs was inviting. Although given that it was late afternoon already, I didn‚Äôt have much time to soak. I unpacked my gear and soon headed through the winding paths of the village reaching the gate as sundown began to set in. There I saw three lone female forms and gave them an awkward smile. ‚ÄúHey guys, I‚Äôm here to help you out on your mission.‚Äù I told them.  
  
Idea 9: Bleach  
  
(So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn‚Äôt captain level to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he‚Äôs paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.)  
  
Starter: Another boring day at college followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by ‚ÄúFull-fledged‚Äù Soul reapers it didn‚Äôt leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.  
  
At least that‚Äôs what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.  
  
It was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see it‚Äôs towering form from my position.  
  
It was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they‚Äôd come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.  
  
Pushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.  
  
When he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt smell like much, but you‚Äôll do as a snack.‚Äù The hollow commented as it charged forward.  
  
‚ÄúJust evade, buy time.‚Äù I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.  
  
The hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature‚Äôs mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating. I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be enough.  
  
Idea 10: Sword Art Online.  
  
(Fairly simple it‚Äôs SAO set in the original death game. I love the idea, so I‚Äôve always loved rping this one. If you want to play canon characters my favorite is for sure Lizbeth, but I‚Äôm open to OC characters!)  
  
Starter: It‚Äôs been months since Akihiko Kayaba has trapped us into this death game. Or at least that‚Äôs how some people looked at it. Others saw it as their dream come true. But most if not, all wanted to push forward and beat the game.  
  
Despite the desire to push forward little progress has been made. Guilds and parties have formed to push through dungeons but with the increased danger and with it more deaths; more and more people simply decided to live out their lives on the lower floors.  
  
Unlike those rushing in to push through the content I was happy enough to go through it at my own pace. This place was like a dream for me, save for the fact I had an increased chance of dying. I was able to live in this game without the worries of the outside world.  
  
I was doing some late-night grinding in an area of dense forest. The sun had set and there was little light save for the bright moon poking through the trees. All was calm, the trees swayed with the wind and the occasional sound of creatures moving about was enough to calm me.  
  
However, the deeper I got into the forest the louder a sound became. At first it was quiet but as I approached, I heard it more clearly. It sounded like steel clashing against steel. Someone was fighting. Moving from a casual walk into a jog I quickly came to a small clearing where I saw two figures fighting, although in the low light I couldn‚Äôt make it out until I got closer.  
  
Idea 11: Avatar the Last Airbender.  
  
(So for this one I guess it can go two different ways. My favorite girls from Avatar would probably be Ty Lee, Suki and Toph. Maybe my character is a powerful bender that either the fire nation or team Avatar wants on their side. I think it might be cool to think that Aang isn‚Äôt the only airbender and instead a small faction managed to escape and continue the lineage. Either that or my character is a powerful firebender of some kind. I‚Äôll leave whichever you prefer to you in your first reply as I‚Äôll leave it open ended.)  
  
Starter: The world was at war ever since the Fire nation attacked. With the intense fighting came mercenaries. Freelance benders or soldiers ready to fight on either side. For a fee of course. And despite my age, being only eighteen I was quite renowned amongst the other bounty hunters for my bending.  
  
Of course, there were talks of the Avatar returning, having repelled an invasion in the south pole, the liberation of Omashu and then the fire nation prison. It seemed they were making quite the stir in the earth kingdom.  
  
It‚Äôd only be a matter of time before they reached the small town, I was in. Perhaps they were already here. But if that was the case surely there would be some kind of stir. Pushing my hair from my face I ordered another drink from the barkeep.  
  
‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre my favourite customer Schwarzer‚Ä¶. You‚Äôre the only one who consistently pays his tab. Unlike the rest of these soldiers or the workers around here.‚Äù The older man says in clear annoyance.  
  
‚ÄúWell who knows, if I wasn‚Äôt so successful, I‚Äôd probably mooch off you too.‚Äù I admitted with a grin. ‚ÄúTry not to talk too ill of the soldiers on either side.‚Äù I added on flicking him an extra coin for a tip once my drink was finished. ‚ÄúWell I better check if anyone has a job for me.‚Äù I say as I push myself up from my seat.  
  
Idea 12: Persona (Girls from 3, 4 and 5).  
  
(So basically this is just gonna be a fairly interesting idea. My character along with the girls of persona 3, 4 and 5 get stranded in this strange dimension where they have to fight their way out to make it back to their own worlds.)  
  
Starter: It all happened so fast. One minute I was in a team meeting with my group discussing what we should use our newfound powers for next. And the next second, I blinked and I was in some kind of strange room.  
  
One by one more people were added into this room. Some of which were dressed in some elaborate costumes. And I frowned as I looked at each one of them, all of which I didn‚Äôt recognize at all and judging by their looks they didn‚Äôt recognize me. Although before we managed to introduce ourselves a booming voice broke the silence.  
  
‚ÄúWelcome all!‚Äù The clearly male voice commented. ‚ÄúTo the room of my design.‚Äù He added on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all confused. And no doubt you‚Äôll want to return back to your homes. However, to do so you‚Äôll need to enter my labyrinth. ‚ÄúMake it to the end and you‚Äôll all return home.‚Äù The voice explained.  
  
‚ÄúOf course, this maze isn‚Äôt without its dangers. Enemies, much like you encounter on a regular basis will roam these halls. As well as beasts of my own design far stronger than those‚Ä¶ Fear not though for every checkpoint you reach this room will become more furnished with amenities. For now, you simply have beds to rest on.‚Äù He said as there was an audible click and the dark room was suddenly lit up. Sure, enough there were rows of beds all lined up one for each person to sleep on.  
  
‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre ready to test yourself, step through this door and enter the first level of the labyrinth.‚Äù He declared as a large door appeared and opened up in front of them.  
  
For a while nobody said anything, probably all too stunned to even process the information. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre all persona users given what he just said.‚Äù I spoke up. ‚ÄúI guess we should probably start with names and strengths, right?‚Äù I questioned the group. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Chris Schwarzer.‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúMy persona Serapth focuses on ranged combat.‚Äù I explained.  
  
Idea 13: Final Fantasy VII (Others can be done).  
  
(So this one will be set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, however if you‚Äôre looking to do others, I‚Äôm more than happy to do so! But this one will be focused on FF VII, Jessie, Tifa and Aerith are best girls!)  
  
Starter: Midgar. Easy place to find work given you were capable enough. There were a lot of monsters prowling the highways between sectors and a lot of people willing to pay mercenaries to get the job done.  
  
‚ÄúHiyah!‚Äù I called out as I cleaved my blade through the neck of a monster severing its head from the rest of its body and slaying it instantly. It was a tough fight but I overcame it. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. The job I was on was simple, kill the beast and return its head to a barkeep in sector 5. I scooped the beast‚Äôs head up into a burlap sack and hoisted it over my shoulder before I headed back to the bar.  
  
By this point I was a rather well-known mercenary by trade. Job‚Äôs exterminating monsters were easy to come by and easy enough to complete. Plus, the payout paid for my room and for most of my meals. As I entered the bar I headed up to the counter and placed the bloody burlap sack on the counter. ‚ÄúGot it done.‚Äù I say to the barkeep.  
  
The older man, his hair and beard white with age frowned a little and looked at the bag. The blood splatter on the counter‚Ä¶ which he had just cleaned was enough to let him know that I was serious and he placed the sack full of gil on the counter.  
  
‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I say as I picked up the purse. It was lighter than I expected, but even if it was short I wasn‚Äôt about to start an argument. In return to my manners, I got a short grunt back.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôtcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain‚Äôt want it.‚Äù He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.  
  
‚ÄúRight, I‚Äôll get on that.‚Äù I say as I grabbed the sack.  
  
‚ÄúAn there was a woman lookin for you.‚Äù He stated. ‚ÄúSaid she‚Äôd be waitin for you in buildin next to the orphanage.‚Äù He stated.  
  
‚ÄúRight, thanks.‚Äù I said to the man and headed out, disposing quickly of the severed head in the sack before I headed up to the building in question. I frowned as I peered inside. My eyes looking around for any sign of someone out of place. It did seem a little crowded in the building after all. I was about to announce myself when I felt a hand tap my shoulder and turned to see who it was.  
  
Idea 14: The Witcher 3.  
  
(So my character will be a Witcher. (wow!) Saving people, hunting things you know? The family business. Anyway, I‚Äôm gonna leave it super open ended for you to come in however you like! If you wanna play a canon character my top two are for sure Ciri and Trist, and OC characters are accepted too!)  
  
Starter: A Werewolf, an odd and rare contract, although I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be a hard one. In fact, I figured with my silver blade that the creature would go down rather quickly. Starting the encounter, I was faced with a harsh reality due to my hubris. I started off well enough, however due to my carelessness I was quickly on the backfoot.  
  
The beast roared as it swung its large clawed hand towards me. I had barely managed to roll out of the way of the attack. Probably due to the increasing levels of blood loss resulting in a careless action on my part. A level of confidence quickly pushed down by the fact a handful of open wounds stung at my flanks.  
  
More scars for later given that I make it out of here, although with my silver blade thrown on the other side of the area leaving me with only a steel sword which barely even phases the thing. I had to reach my blade, although with my focus on dodging the attacks it was hard to find an opening to do so.  
  
I raised a hand and cast the igni sign launching flames at the creature who leapt back and I tried my best to make it past the creature only to have to dodge another strike as the beast recovered remarkably fast. ‚ÄúStubborn bastard, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù I questioned a little sourly.  
  
Idea 15: Harry Potter.  
  
(So to keep this one interesting I‚Äôm thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don‚Äôt exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other celebs/ecelebs as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too!)  
  
Starter: Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.  
  
The ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abound about what was really happening.  
  
Stepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn‚Äôt stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.  
  
Glad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs around here somewhere.‚Äù I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.  
  
Closing Words: And that is everything done! If you‚Äôve read this far, I want to give a big thanks! And if you have any questions or suggestions or even criticisms, I‚Äôm open to hearing them. I know this was probably a big read so thanks again for your time and I hope to talk to some of you soon! Also I just want to state it again  
  
Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem. (Sorry if that‚Äôs an issue, I still wish you the best!)",WrittenRoleplay,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WrittenRoleplay/comments/pdcu3l/m4a_a_playing_as_f_massive_prompt_drop_of_harem/,Smut-Only,StrifeERP,pdcu3l,/r/WrittenRoleplay/comments/pdcu3l/m4a_a_playing_as_f_massive_prompt_drop_of_harem/,https://www.reddit.com/r/WrittenRoleplay/comments/pdcu3l/m4a_a_playing_as_f_massive_prompt_drop_of_harem/,0,2021-08-28
[M4A] (A Playing as F) Prompt drop of Harem Based Anime and Fandom RPs," 

[https://imgur.com/a/paxhS5W](https://imgur.com/a/paxhS5W)

Hey guys!

Today I bring you a massive list of RP Ideas that I‚Äôm constantly working on. These posts are mainly around anime I‚Äôve watched or games/Fandoms I‚Äôm in. However, there are some OC based stuff that might be used either way!

For my replies I only write in first person and the length of my replies vary from a few sentences to a few solid paragraphs depending on how much is going on in a scene. I figured I‚Äôd put a fair warning here that if you reply with low detail, I won‚Äôt be rping with you. I‚Äôm not looking for a few words as a response. While that might be your thing, that's fine and power to you! It‚Äôs just not mine.

I‚Äôm someone who likes a nice balance of build-up and story to go along with the smut. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of constant sex, or sex that starts within one or two replies. I also like cute dates and moments, and love to type out action driven moments.

What I look for in a partner:

Third Person responses (Unless you're playing an OC among the harem)

Active - I don't wanna be waiting a week for a reply. I understand if you're busy outside of RP but please let me know so I'm not just waiting around and twiddling my thumbs. If I go a week without hearing from you at all I'm going to assume you're no longer interested.

Communicative: It kinda links in with the other but if you're not feeling the RP or you're busy IRL I'm not gonna get mad or anything I'm an understanding person!

Detailed responses: Anything 2 sentences up to a paragraph is enough, but more is always very much appreciated.

This one is a bit of a nitpick, but Please don't just message me with ""I'll rp"" Or ""want to rp?"" tell me what rps you wanna do in your initial message! If you're undecided please just list the ones you want to do and we can go there. If you do message me like the previous I'll probably just ignore the message.

For the platforms I mainly do rps on Discord, however I also have a kik and my inbox here. So feel free to ask about my user for either platform.

Now to get into the meat and potatoes, I‚Äôll post my kinks and limits. There‚Äôs a lot there and not all of them will be applicable to the starters. As I‚Äôm a massive fan of harems I‚Äôll put this in bold here. Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies.

Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem. (Sorry if that‚Äôs an issue, I still wish you the best!)

Kinks:

Harems ‚Äì (Which doesn‚Äôt mean playing a bunch of characters at once. If you prefer to play 1 character per scene that‚Äôs fine!)

Outercourse (Which is stiff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging, that kinda thing), Risky/public spaces. (Places you can get caught but don‚Äôt. Toilet stalls, changing booths, that kinda thing), Facials, Freckles (Face and body), Big, nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle‚Ä¶ just an overall fan of the jiggle if I‚Äôm honest), Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, thigh high socks, shower/water sex (places like pools, showers, hot tubs that kinda things, and a Mutual desire for sex. Incest. I also don‚Äôt mind pubic hair as long as it‚Äôs not overly bushy trimmed stuff is nice! :)

Limits:

Pregnacy, which also includes lactation (Hard limit, sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, toilet stuff, noncon/rape, Gagnbangs (reverse gangbangs with females is fine), Male on male, Futas, Rimming/pegging. (There could be more that I haven‚Äôt thought of, if you‚Äôre unsure feel free to ask)

There could be more that I might be into, that hasn‚Äôt been listed so feel free to ask about it and we can work something out. And without further ado let‚Äôs head straight into it.

I‚Äôve made an easy access list for you to read through to see if anything piques your interest before you have to scroll through this abundant list. Of course, I stated this before but I‚Äôll state it again.

Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies. Especially canon characters.

Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.

(So for this one, my character will be a transfer into class 1-A. From Shiketsu. His power is that of Persuasion. With the power he‚Äôs able to convince someone to do something as if it‚Äôs their own free will. That being said he‚Äôs rather hesitant to use it on other people and due to the stigma around his quirk he‚Äôs been seen as an outcast and a freak and has been constantly harassed due to the nature of his quirk.)

(The idea I have for this RP is that the girl(s) of class 1-A will help him come out of his shell and accept that his quirk isn‚Äôt the villainous thing that other people have led him on to be. As he becomes more confident his small commands will be able to become longer term commands. There will also be story and action to keep the plot engaging and interesting.)

Starter: It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn‚Äôt last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.

‚ÄúMorning everyone.‚Äù He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôve got a new student transferring in from another school. He‚Äôs from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it‚Äôs got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless make sure he feels welcome.‚Äù He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem child of the U.A class Bakugo.

With that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.

I had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. ‚ÄúMy name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you all.‚Äù I say bowing to the class.

Satisfied with the introduction Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.

Idea 2: One Piece.

(I‚Äôm not so sure how I want to approach this one, however I‚Äôll jump in and give it ago. Much like the MHA starter this character will have the power of Persuasion. Having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I‚Äôm thinking for now either he joins the Straw Hats and goes on adventures with them, or he makes a crew with characters from the story (Obviously this doesn‚Äôt have to be cannon and completely made up as we go. Either way I‚Äôm super keen on this since I love One Piece to death.)

Starter: Adventure! Freedom, Treasure and Booze! These were all the things a pirate needed in life. And exactly what every pirate set out to obtain. Two years after the events at Marineford where Strawhat Luffy himself took on the government with an army behind him, and the Whitebeard Pirates at his side in order to rescue his brother‚Ä¶ And two years since I felt inspired enough in his absence to set forth on my own.

I gathered up a strong crew and made a name for myself. My alias being Silver Tongue Schwarzer, a nice title which rolled off the tongue. I had no issues amassing a sizable bounty at 90 million berries. While it wasn‚Äôt as grand as other pirates, the world government saw enough of a threat in my power to provide a bounty that large.

So then why was I now sitting at a bar on the Sabaody Archipelago, alone and staring into the amber liquid of booze in a mug? It was simple. Mutiny. Those whom I had trusted most among my crew turned on a dime and after reaching the Archipelago they threw me overboard and turned around. To where I didn‚Äôt know and quite frankly after their betrayal I didn‚Äôt care.

‚ÄúDamn them. Damn them all.‚Äù I muttered under my breath cursing as I downed the rest of my contents. ‚ÄúAnother!‚Äù I called out to the barkeep who approached to fill my mug.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking a little rough there, you sure you need another?‚Äù The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything else to do. I don‚Äôt even know what else to do with myself.‚Äù I responded grumpily. ‚ÄúJust fill it up.‚Äù I demanded.

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.

Idea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.

(So I‚Äôve just completed the anime for Jujutsu Kaisen and I really enjoy it. I‚Äôve got an interesting idea for a curse ability, my character‚Äôs power is basically he emits smells. Mostly for support, however his ability is so strong that he‚Äôs unable to turn it off. He always smells great to anyone who smells him, almost like a pheromone. And to demons it‚Äôs a lure. Because of this he wears a lot to cover up his body so he doesn‚Äôt let out as much of his scent. He‚Äôs in Jujutsu now because he wanted to learn how to use different smells for different things and one day he hopes to be able to control his powers. Since the cast is pretty small, feel free to play OC characters for this one as well as canon! :) )

Starter: The sounds of fabric ripping filled the air followed up by my swearing as my scent was released into the air. This was bad. My scent leaking out meant that every cursed spirit within a few blocks would barrel down on my position.

It seemed the time for subtlety was out the window and as such I pulled the large good back and unzipped my jacket which zipped all the way up to cover half my face. Underneath my body was bare. I mean wearing a large coat all day with extra layers was asking to sweat like a pig. I tossed my coat to the side and threw my gloves along with it.

My cursed energy seeped out increasing the potency and the range of my smell. My eyes narrowed at the grade three curse spirit which was staring me down. ‚ÄúSleep.‚Äù I say clapping my hands together as my scent changed to that of a sleep agent.

The cursed spirit swayed a little before collapsing to the ground. My smell even caused me to sway a little as I breathed it in, however I had built up an immunity to it. The sounds of more cursed spirits barreling down on my position could be heard all around me as I grabbed my coat and my gloves and made a run for it into a nearby building. I didn‚Äôt have time to finish the spirit off before I ran into the building. This would be a better place for me to fight them given that my smell could permeate more efficiently than it would in an open space.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if help was going to come, but for now I‚Äôd operate under the assumption that it wasn't.

Idea 4: Fire Force.

(I‚Äôve finished watching Fire force and I love the idea and the characters! Especially Maki! So with that in mind I‚Äôve decided to type up a starter to add to it.. My character will be similar to Shinra in the fact that his flames are speed types, however rather than prolonged speed, he uses his flames to propel his attacks with his legs and hands‚Ä¶ It‚Äôll probably be much clearer when I‚Äôm explaining it in RP.)

Starter: I looked up to the rather run-down looking base of the 8th division of the fire force. It looked rather‚Ä¶ shabby. Although I quickly shook my head. They‚Äôd been nice enough to let me in and I approached the large oak doors gently pushing them aside. Once inside I met with a large mound of muscle. ‚ÄúHm?‚Äù The male grunted curiously. ‚ÄúYou the newbie?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúCaptain Obi.‚Äù The male said as he placed his weight down and extended a muscular arm out to me.

‚ÄúChris Schwarzer.‚Äù I responded as I reached my hand out and shook his own. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù I stated.

Obi smiled as he nodded. ‚ÄúCome with me, I‚Äôll introduce you to the rest of the team.‚Äù He said as he led me down to a noisy room which was lively and when I entered.

‚ÄúAlright you lot listen up. This is Chris Schwarzer, he‚Äôs the new rookie I told you about, and he‚Äôs new around here. So, make sure you make him feel welcome.‚Äù Captain Obi spoke up.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you all.‚Äù I say as I bowed humbly to them all.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get a test on your mettle soon enough kid, once you get the tour and put your bag away. The rest of us will meet us up on the roof.‚Äù He stated and guided me around the grounds of the company 8 base. Soon enough we headed over to the bunk rooms where he opened the door. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your roommate, play nice.‚Äù He said to the figure inside.

‚ÄúOh! Right.‚Äù I say as I bowed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù I stated humbly I wanted to make a good impression on the team after all.

Idea 5: Demon Slayer.

(Recently I went to go see the Mugen train movie and it‚Äôs reignited my love for this series, so I felt the need to include it for sure! This will be open to both OC and canon characters so feel free to jump in as either one! My character will be a member of the demon slayer corps who is on a near impossible mission in a small village.)

Starter: I panted heavily as I clutched at the wound in my right side. My shaking left hand clutched tightly to the hilt of my blade. This mission had been easy to start with, but the reports were wrong. I had also gotten carless and sloppy due to the fact I had been up for three days straight. Something was luring an incredible mass of Demons to this town and I was tasked to find out what‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt know there would be this many. I tried to regulate my breathing and compose myself even though my body felt as though it would give at any moment. In front of me was a horde of demons, and my eyes studied them waiting for any sign of movement among them. Behind me laid a mass of slain demons which had all been decapitated and were in the process of evaporating.

Checking the hand on my side I didn‚Äôt need to look down to feel that it had dampened with blood. I cursed under my breath my thoughts wandering to the possibility that this might be my final fight. I knew that if I made it to dawn which was only a short time away that I might be able to make it, although that was only a thin sliver of hope.

This was a mission that seemed to have no end, and even though I‚Äôd asked for help from HQ I knew it‚Äôd be some time before they got here‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt even sure how long ago that was‚Ä¶ My thoughts questioned if even a Hashira would have problems with this mission.

I had to keep fighting‚Ä¶ fight till there was no life left in me. And as the surge of demons rushed forth once again, I exhaled. Steadying my breathing as the winds around me changed. ‚ÄúFirst form: Dust Whirlwind Cutter‚Äù I called out as I surged forward slicing through the closest demons and giving myself another moment to breathe. However, my feet were shaky and I stumbled slightly. Many of the demons who noticed my weakening form began to laugh almost in a taunting and mocking manner as they stepped towards me once again.

Idea 6: Attack on Titan.

(So this‚Äôll be a run of the mill attack on titan RP. It‚Äôll be action and adventure based. I‚Äôll probably stick to the start of the story right after everyone meets the scouts. Although I think for this RP, I‚Äôll make the scouts different, having a different leader who is a little more corrupt and willing to frugally send troops to their deaths. As for my character I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôll make him a titan shifter or not. Also, if you want to play multiple canon characters that‚Äôs great!)

Starter: There was a solid ‚Äúthunk‚Äù as my hooks embedded themselves into the woody flesh of a tree and I reeled myself onto the branch. I panted heavily as I felt the warm, almost boiling titan‚Äôs blood evaporating from my cheeks and looked down to the corpse of the last titan I‚Äôd killed which was now steaming.

Between heavy breaths of air, I wiped the back of my hand against my forehead wiping away fat beads of sweat and slicked back my ginger hair from my eyes while my blue eyes looked out to the large forest below. It seemed that no matter how many titans were killed more and more kept coming.

‚ÄúDamnit how did I get stuck on this mission?‚Äù I questioned out loud as I tapped on my gas cylinders to feel that they were empty‚Ä¶ not to mention I was down to my last few blades. ‚ÄúDid they really expect us to set up a forward base in this shithole? And just where the hell is the supply unit?‚Äù I speak out loud. A familiar ‚ÄúThunk‚Äù of hooks embedding themselves into wood snapped me from my despairing thoughts.

I looked down to the clearly female form of another scout as she reeled herself towards the sturdy branch I was sitting on and not wanting to scare her if she hadn‚Äôt seen me peeked my head over. ‚ÄúYou need a hand?‚Äù I asked as I reached down my hand to help her up onto the branch.

Idea 7: Fairy Tail

(It‚Äôs been a little while since I‚Äôve seen this series, but I‚Äôve always thought the girls were cute and I loved it! Given my time away from it, I might need some time to refamiliarize myself with how magic works, but I‚Äôm probably going to make him a lot like the character in fire force, a strong/fast attacker who uses fire. He‚Äôll be an entry level member to the guild to begin with.)

Starter: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn‚Äôt part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.

I had only been part of the guild for a couple of weeks and so far, it‚Äôs not been as exciting as I‚Äôd hoped, although I figured that it‚Äôd pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. ‚ÄúSchwarzer my boy!‚Äù He said as he patted me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúHow are you fitting in?‚Äù He questioned.

‚ÄúFine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.‚Äù I say to him in response.

‚ÄúGlad to hear it! You‚Äôve been doing a good job, although I‚Äôd like to see you do more.‚Äù The male said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?‚Äù He questioned.

‚ÄúYes of course!‚Äù I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.

‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù He said cheerfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll introduce you to who you‚Äôll be working with.‚Äù He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.

Idea 8: Naruto

(So for this one I like the idea that my character is a nomadic mercenary from the cloud village who uses lightning release to increase his speed. He is hired by the leaf to help the ninja of the village on a mission, maybe he also has some kind of hidden power that boosts his chakra but also increases his libido. Not too sure how I wanna go about this one.)

Starter: The Hokage Tsunade Senju looked over me with a curious gaze and then down to my application form. I had been summoned to the village for a mission, but I wasn‚Äôt told what other than the fact that the pay was good. The older woman eyed me up with an air of suspicion as she held up the paper before studying my face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre younger than I expected given everything you‚Äôve done.‚Äù She stated honestly. ‚ÄúBut the intelligence division did a thorough search into you and your village. You check out.‚Äù She stated as she slammed the approved stamp down onto my paper.

‚ÄúJust remember, if you do anything to endanger this village, I‚Äôll snuff you out personally.‚Äù She said in an icy and threatening tone. Feeling a cold bead of sweat roll down the side of my face I nodded. ‚ÄúOf course. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of it.‚Äù I say. Internally I make a mental note not to cross her in any way.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù She said putting a smile across her features. ‚ÄúYour team is going to be assembled at the gate by sundown.‚Äù She stated. Here‚Äôs a key to your lodgings at the hotsprings inn.‚Äù She stated as she handed me a key. ‚ÄúMake sure you‚Äôre not late.‚Äù She started with her same warning tone.

I nodded as I took the key and smiled at the woman. ‚ÄúUnderstood, thank you.‚Äù I say as I gathered up my things and headed over to the inn. It was beautiful and the warm air of the hot springs was inviting. Although given that it was late afternoon already, I didn‚Äôt have much time to soak. I unpacked my gear and soon headed through the winding paths of the village reaching the gate as sundown began to set in. There I saw three lone female forms and gave them an awkward smile. ‚ÄúHey guys, I‚Äôm here to help you out on your mission.‚Äù I told them.

Idea 9: Bleach

(So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn‚Äôt captain level to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he‚Äôs paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.)

Starter: Another boring day at college followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by ‚ÄúFull-fledged‚Äù Soul reapers it didn‚Äôt leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.

At least that‚Äôs what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.

It was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see it‚Äôs towering form from my position.

It was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they‚Äôd come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.

Pushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.

When he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt smell like much, but you‚Äôll do as a snack.‚Äù The hollow commented as it charged forward.

‚ÄúJust evade, buy time.‚Äù I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.

The hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature‚Äôs mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating. I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be enough.

Idea 10: Sword Art Online.

(Fairly simple it‚Äôs SAO set in the original death game. I love the idea, so I‚Äôve always loved rping this one. If you want to play canon characters my favorite is for sure Lizbeth, but I‚Äôm open to OC characters!)

Starter: It‚Äôs been months since Akihiko Kayaba has trapped us into this death game. Or at least that‚Äôs how some people looked at it. Others saw it as their dream come true. But most if not, all wanted to push forward and beat the game.

Despite the desire to push forward little progress has been made. Guilds and parties have formed to push through dungeons but with the increased danger and with it more deaths; more and more people simply decided to live out their lives on the lower floors.

Unlike those rushing in to push through the content I was happy enough to go through it at my own pace. This place was like a dream for me, save for the fact I had an increased chance of dying. I was able to live in this game without the worries of the outside world.

I was doing some late-night grinding in an area of dense forest. The sun had set and there was little light save for the bright moon poking through the trees. All was calm, the trees swayed with the wind and the occasional sound of creatures moving about was enough to calm me.

However, the deeper I got into the forest the louder a sound became. At first it was quiet but as I approached, I heard it more clearly. It sounded like steel clashing against steel. Someone was fighting. Moving from a casual walk into a jog I quickly came to a small clearing where I saw two figures fighting, although in the low light I couldn‚Äôt make it out until I got closer.

Idea 11: Avatar the Last Airbender.

(So for this one I guess it can go two different ways. My favorite girls from Avatar would probably be Ty Lee, Suki and Toph. Maybe my character is a powerful bender that either the fire nation or team Avatar wants on their side. I think it might be cool to think that Aang isn‚Äôt the only airbender and instead a small faction managed to escape and continue the lineage. Either that or my character is a powerful firebender of some kind. I‚Äôll leave whichever you prefer to you in your first reply as I‚Äôll leave it open ended.)

Starter: The world was at war ever since the Fire nation attacked. With the intense fighting came mercenaries. Freelance benders or soldiers ready to fight on either side. For a fee of course. And despite my age, being only eighteen I was quite renowned amongst the other bounty hunters for my bending.

Of course, there were talks of the Avatar returning, having repelled an invasion in the south pole, the liberation of Omashu and then the fire nation prison. It seemed they were making quite the stir in the earth kingdom.

It‚Äôd only be a matter of time before they reached the small town, I was in. Perhaps they were already here. But if that was the case surely there would be some kind of stir. Pushing my hair from my face I ordered another drink from the barkeep.

‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre my favourite customer Schwarzer‚Ä¶. You‚Äôre the only one who consistently pays his tab. Unlike the rest of these soldiers or the workers around here.‚Äù The older man says in clear annoyance.

‚ÄúWell who knows, if I wasn‚Äôt so successful, I‚Äôd probably mooch off you too.‚Äù I admitted with a grin. ‚ÄúTry not to talk too ill of the soldiers on either side.‚Äù I added on flicking him an extra coin for a tip once my drink was finished. ‚ÄúWell I better check if anyone has a job for me.‚Äù I say as I push myself up from my seat.

Idea 12: Persona (Girls from 3, 4 and 5).

(So basically this is just gonna be a fairly interesting idea. My character along with the girls of persona 3, 4 and 5 get stranded in this strange dimension where they have to fight their way out to make it back to their own worlds.)

Starter: It all happened so fast. One minute I was in a team meeting with my group discussing what we should use our newfound powers for next. And the next second, I blinked and I was in some kind of strange room.

One by one more people were added into this room. Some of which were dressed in some elaborate costumes. And I frowned as I looked at each one of them, all of which I didn‚Äôt recognize at all and judging by their looks they didn‚Äôt recognize me. Although before we managed to introduce ourselves a booming voice broke the silence.

‚ÄúWelcome all!‚Äù The clearly male voice commented. ‚ÄúTo the room of my design.‚Äù He added on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all confused. And no doubt you‚Äôll want to return back to your homes. However, to do so you‚Äôll need to enter my labyrinth. ‚ÄúMake it to the end and you‚Äôll all return home.‚Äù The voice explained.

‚ÄúOf course, this maze isn‚Äôt without its dangers. Enemies, much like you encounter on a regular basis will roam these halls. As well as beasts of my own design far stronger than those‚Ä¶ Fear not though for every checkpoint you reach this room will become more furnished with amenities. For now, you simply have beds to rest on.‚Äù He said as there was an audible click and the dark room was suddenly lit up. Sure, enough there were rows of beds all lined up one for each person to sleep on.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre ready to test yourself, step through this door and enter the first level of the labyrinth.‚Äù He declared as a large door appeared and opened up in front of them.

For a while nobody said anything, probably all too stunned to even process the information. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre all persona users given what he just said.‚Äù I spoke up. ‚ÄúI guess we should probably start with names and strengths, right?‚Äù I questioned the group. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Chris Schwarzer.‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúMy persona Serapth focuses on ranged combat.‚Äù I explained.

Idea 13: Final Fantasy VII (Others can be done).

(So this one will be set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, however if you‚Äôre looking to do others, I‚Äôm more than happy to do so! But this one will be focused on FF VII, Jessie, Tifa and Aerith are best girls!)

Starter: Midgar. Easy place to find work given you were capable enough. There were a lot of monsters prowling the highways between sectors and a lot of people willing to pay mercenaries to get the job done.

‚ÄúHiyah!‚Äù I called out as I cleaved my blade through the neck of a monster severing its head from the rest of its body and slaying it instantly. It was a tough fight but I overcame it. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. The job I was on was simple, kill the beast and return its head to a barkeep in sector 5. I scooped the beast‚Äôs head up into a burlap sack and hoisted it over my shoulder before I headed back to the bar.

By this point I was a rather well-known mercenary by trade. Job‚Äôs exterminating monsters were easy to come by and easy enough to complete. Plus, the payout paid for my room and for most of my meals. As I entered the bar I headed up to the counter and placed the bloody burlap sack on the counter. ‚ÄúGot it done.‚Äù I say to the barkeep.

The older man, his hair and beard white with age frowned a little and looked at the bag. The blood splatter on the counter‚Ä¶ which he had just cleaned was enough to let him know that I was serious and he placed the sack full of gil on the counter.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I say as I picked up the purse. It was lighter than I expected, but even if it was short I wasn‚Äôt about to start an argument. In return to my manners, I got a short grunt back.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôtcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain‚Äôt want it.‚Äù He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.

‚ÄúRight, I‚Äôll get on that.‚Äù I say as I grabbed the sack.

‚ÄúAn there was a woman lookin for you.‚Äù He stated. ‚ÄúSaid she‚Äôd be waitin for you in buildin next to the orphanage.‚Äù He stated.

‚ÄúRight, thanks.‚Äù I said to the man and headed out, disposing quickly of the severed head in the sack before I headed up to the building in question. I frowned as I peered inside. My eyes looking around for any sign of someone out of place. It did seem a little crowded in the building after all. I was about to announce myself when I felt a hand tap my shoulder and turned to see who it was.

Idea 14: The Witcher 3.

(So my character will be a Witcher. (wow!) Saving people, hunting things you know? The family business. Anyway, I‚Äôm gonna leave it super open ended for you to come in however you like! If you wanna play a canon character my top two are for sure Ciri and Trist, and OC characters are accepted too!)

Starter: A Werewolf, an odd and rare contract, although I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be a hard one. In fact, I figured with my silver blade that the creature would go down rather quickly. Starting the encounter, I was faced with a harsh reality due to my hubris. I started off well enough, however due to my carelessness I was quickly on the backfoot.

The beast roared as it swung its large clawed hand towards me. I had barely managed to roll out of the way of the attack. Probably due to the increasing levels of blood loss resulting in a careless action on my part. A level of confidence quickly pushed down by the fact a handful of open wounds stung at my flanks.

More scars for later given that I make it out of here, although with my silver blade thrown on the other side of the area leaving me with only a steel sword which barely even phases the thing. I had to reach my blade, although with my focus on dodging the attacks it was hard to find an opening to do so.

I raised a hand and cast the igni sign launching flames at the creature who leapt back and I tried my best to make it past the creature only to have to dodge another strike as the beast recovered remarkably fast. ‚ÄúStubborn bastard, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù I questioned a little sourly.

Idea 15: Harry Potter.

(So to keep this one interesting I‚Äôm thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don‚Äôt exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other celebs/ecelebs as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too!)

Starter: Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.

The ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abound about what was really happening.

Stepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn‚Äôt stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.

Glad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs around here somewhere.‚Äù I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.

Closing Words: And that is everything done! If you‚Äôve read this far, I want to give a big thanks! And if you have any questions or suggestions or even criticisms, I‚Äôm open to hearing them. I know this was probably a big read so thanks again for your time and I hope to talk to some of you soon! Also I just want to state it again

Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem.

"[M4A] (A Playing as F) Massive prompt drop of Harem Based Anime and Fandom centric RP prompts. Balance of Smut and Story! (Anime, Rule 34, Fandoms, Games.)"," 

[https://imgur.com/a/paxhS5W](https://imgur.com/a/paxhS5W)

Hey guys!

Today I bring you a massive list of RP Ideas that I‚Äôm constantly working on. These posts are mainly around anime I‚Äôve watched or games/Fandoms I‚Äôm in. However, there are some OC based stuff that might be used either way!

For my replies I only write in first person and the length of my replies vary from a few sentences to a few solid paragraphs depending on how much is going on in a scene. I figured I‚Äôd put a fair warning here that if you reply with low detail, I won‚Äôt be rping with you. I‚Äôm not looking for a few words as a response. While that might be your thing, that's fine and power to you! It‚Äôs just not mine.

I‚Äôm someone who likes a nice balance of build-up and story to go along with the smut. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of constant sex, or sex that starts within one or two replies. I also like cute dates and moments, and love to type out action driven moments.

What I look for in a partner:

Third Person responses (Unless you're playing an OC among the harem)

Active - I don't wanna be waiting a week for a reply. I understand if you're busy outside of RP but please let me know so I'm not just waiting around and twiddling my thumbs. If I go a week without hearing from you at all I'm going to assume you're no longer interested.

Communicative: It kinda links in with the other but if you're not feeling the RP or you're busy IRL I'm not gonna get mad or anything I'm an understanding person!

Detailed responses: Anything 2 sentences up to a paragraph is enough, but more is always very much appreciated.

This one is a bit of a nitpick, but Please don't just message me with ""I'll rp"" Or ""want to rp?"" tell me what rps you wanna do in your initial message! If you're undecided please just list the ones you want to do and we can go there. If you do message me like the previous I'll probably just ignore the message.

For the platforms I mainly do rps on Discord, however I also have a kik and my inbox here. So feel free to ask about my user for either platform.

Now to get into the meat and potatoes, I‚Äôll post my kinks and limits. There‚Äôs a lot there and not all of them will be applicable to the starters. As I‚Äôm a massive fan of harems I‚Äôll put this in bold here. Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies.

Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem. (Sorry if that‚Äôs an issue, I still wish you the best!)

Kinks:

Harems ‚Äì (Which doesn‚Äôt mean playing a bunch of characters at once. If you prefer to play 1 character per scene that‚Äôs fine!)

Outercourse (Which is stiff like titjobs, thigh jobs, grinding, hot dogging, that kinda thing), Risky/public spaces. (Places you can get caught but don‚Äôt. Toilet stalls, changing booths, that kinda thing), Facials, Freckles (Face and body), Big, nicely shaped bums (Especially if they jiggle‚Ä¶ just an overall fan of the jiggle if I‚Äôm honest), Creampies, Cum on tits/body, big cumshots, thigh high socks, shower/water sex (places like pools, showers, hot tubs that kinda things, and a Mutual desire for sex. Incest. I also don‚Äôt mind pubic hair as long as it‚Äôs not overly bushy trimmed stuff is nice! :)

Limits:

Pregnacy, which also includes lactation (Hard limit, sorry), Vomit, Piss, Blood, toilet stuff, noncon/rape, Gagnbangs (reverse gangbangs with females is fine), Male on male, Futas, Rimming/pegging. (There could be more that I haven‚Äôt thought of, if you‚Äôre unsure feel free to ask)

There could be more that I might be into, that hasn‚Äôt been listed so feel free to ask about it and we can work something out. And without further ado let‚Äôs head straight into it.

I‚Äôve made an easy access list for you to read through to see if anything piques your interest before you have to scroll through this abundant list. Of course, I stated this before but I‚Äôll state it again.

Those willing to play multiple characters will have a higher preference in replies. Especially canon characters.

Currently due to high demand I‚Äôm only accepting those people who are willing to play multiple FEMALE characters for a harem. (Sorry if that‚Äôs an issue, I still wish you the best!)

Idea 1: My Harem (Hero) Academia.

(So for this one, my character will be a transfer into class 1-A. From Shiketsu. His power is that of Persuasion. With the power he‚Äôs able to convince someone to do something as if it‚Äôs their own free will. That being said he‚Äôs rather hesitant to use it on other people and due to the stigma around his quirk he‚Äôs been seen as an outcast and a freak and has been constantly harassed due to the nature of his quirk.)

(The idea I have for this RP is that the girl(s) of class 1-A will help him come out of his shell and accept that his quirk isn‚Äôt the villainous thing that other people have led him on to be. As he becomes more confident his small commands will be able to become longer term commands. There will also be story and action to keep the plot engaging and interesting.)

Starter: It was a day which started like most others in Class 1-A. The students got ready in the dorms and headed to class to chat among themselves while they waited for Aizawa to enter. However, unlike most days there seemed to be an extra desk placed in the room. The seat caused some confusion which didn‚Äôt last long as the first bell rang and Aizawa entered the room.

‚ÄúMorning everyone.‚Äù He stated in his mainly bored and sleepy tone which seemed to sound like he was stifling a yawn. ‚ÄúToday we‚Äôve got a new student transferring in from another school. He‚Äôs from Shiketsu, some of you may recognize the name since it‚Äôs got the same level of prestige as U.A. but regardless make sure he feels welcome.‚Äù He said, pointing a sweeping stare at everyone and finally resting on the problem child of the U.A class Bakugo.

With that he fell silent and I felt it was my cue to enter. Swallowing a little at the nerves I steeled them quickly and entered. Nervously my blue eyes sweep over some of the familiar faces in the room. Many of the students had standout performances in the UA sports festival and as well in the news reports about the villain attack on the training camp.

I had a lot to live up to if I wanted to join these legends in training but regardless, I was determined to do just that. Breathing a little and shifting my auburn hair from my eyes I smiled the best I could. ‚ÄúMy name is Schwarzer, Chris Schwarzer. It‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you all.‚Äù I say bowing to the class.

Satisfied with the introduction Aizawa nodded to the spare seat in the room. Taking that as an order I nodded back and headed over to my seat sitting down and getting my books out. Curiously I turned to the seat next to me noticing one of the girls in the class and gave her a slight smile as Aizawa began his lesson.

Idea 2: One Piece.

(I‚Äôm not so sure how I want to approach this one, however I‚Äôll jump in and give it ago. Much like the MHA starter this character will have the power of Persuasion. Having eaten the Persua-Persua fruit. I‚Äôm thinking for now either he joins the Straw Hats and goes on adventures with them, or he makes a crew with characters from the story (Obviously this doesn‚Äôt have to be cannon and completely made up as we go. Either way I‚Äôm super keen on this since I love One Piece to death.)

Starter: Adventure! Freedom, Treasure and Booze! These were all the things a pirate needed in life. And exactly what every pirate set out to obtain. Two years after the events at Marineford where Strawhat Luffy himself took on the government with an army behind him, and the Whitebeard Pirates at his side in order to rescue his brother‚Ä¶ And two years since I felt inspired enough in his absence to set forth on my own.

I gathered up a strong crew and made a name for myself. My alias being Silver Tongue Schwarzer, a nice title which rolled off the tongue. I had no issues amassing a sizable bounty at 90 million berries. While it wasn‚Äôt as grand as other pirates, the world government saw enough of a threat in my power to provide a bounty that large.

So then why was I now sitting at a bar on the Sabaody Archipelago, alone and staring into the amber liquid of booze in a mug? It was simple. Mutiny. Those whom I had trusted most among my crew turned on a dime and after reaching the Archipelago they threw me overboard and turned around. To where I didn‚Äôt know and quite frankly after their betrayal I didn‚Äôt care.

‚ÄúDamn them. Damn them all.‚Äù I muttered under my breath cursing as I downed the rest of my contents. ‚ÄúAnother!‚Äù I called out to the barkeep who approached to fill my mug.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre looking a little rough there, you sure you need another?‚Äù The bartender asked as he took the mug from me.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have anything else to do. I don‚Äôt even know what else to do with myself.‚Äù I responded grumpily. ‚ÄúJust fill it up.‚Äù I demanded.

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù The bartender responded as he filled it with more of the alcoholic amber liquid and slid It in front of me.

Idea 3: Jujutsu Kaisen.

(So I‚Äôve just completed the anime for Jujutsu Kaisen and I really enjoy it. I‚Äôve got an interesting idea for a curse ability, my character‚Äôs power is basically he emits smells. Mostly for support, however his ability is so strong that he‚Äôs unable to turn it off. He always smells great to anyone who smells him, almost like a pheromone. And to demons it‚Äôs a lure. Because of this he wears a lot to cover up his body so he doesn‚Äôt let out as much of his scent. He‚Äôs in Jujutsu now because he wanted to learn how to use different smells for different things and one day he hopes to be able to control his powers. Since the cast is pretty small, feel free to play OC characters for this one as well as canon! :) )

Starter: The sounds of fabric ripping filled the air followed up by my swearing as my scent was released into the air. This was bad. My scent leaking out meant that every cursed spirit within a few blocks would barrel down on my position.

It seemed the time for subtlety was out the window and as such I pulled the large good back and unzipped my jacket which zipped all the way up to cover half my face. Underneath my body was bare. I mean wearing a large coat all day with extra layers was asking to sweat like a pig. I tossed my coat to the side and threw my gloves along with it.

My cursed energy seeped out increasing the potency and the range of my smell. My eyes narrowed at the grade three curse spirit which was staring me down. ‚ÄúSleep.‚Äù I say clapping my hands together as my scent changed to that of a sleep agent.

The cursed spirit swayed a little before collapsing to the ground. My smell even caused me to sway a little as I breathed it in, however I had built up an immunity to it. The sounds of more cursed spirits barreling down on my position could be heard all around me as I grabbed my coat and my gloves and made a run for it into a nearby building. I didn‚Äôt have time to finish the spirit off before I ran into the building. This would be a better place for me to fight them given that my smell could permeate more efficiently than it would in an open space.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if help was going to come, but for now I‚Äôd operate under the assumption that it wasn't.

Idea 4: Fire Force.

(I‚Äôve finished watching Fire force and I love the idea and the characters! Especially Maki! So with that in mind I‚Äôve decided to type up a starter to add to it.. My character will be similar to Shinra in the fact that his flames are speed types, however rather than prolonged speed, he uses his flames to propel his attacks with his legs and hands‚Ä¶ It‚Äôll probably be much clearer when I‚Äôm explaining it in RP.)

Starter: I looked up to the rather run-down looking base of the 8th division of the fire force. It looked rather‚Ä¶ shabby. Although I quickly shook my head. They‚Äôd been nice enough to let me in and I approached the large oak doors gently pushing them aside. Once inside I met with a large mound of muscle. ‚ÄúHm?‚Äù The male grunted curiously. ‚ÄúYou the newbie?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúCaptain Obi.‚Äù The male said as he placed his weight down and extended a muscular arm out to me.

‚ÄúChris Schwarzer.‚Äù I responded as I reached my hand out and shook his own. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù I stated.

Obi smiled as he nodded. ‚ÄúCome with me, I‚Äôll introduce you to the rest of the team.‚Äù He said as he led me down to a noisy room which was lively and when I entered.

‚ÄúAlright you lot listen up. This is Chris Schwarzer, he‚Äôs the new rookie I told you about, and he‚Äôs new around here. So, make sure you make him feel welcome.‚Äù Captain Obi spoke up.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you all.‚Äù I say as I bowed humbly to them all.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get a test on your mettle soon enough kid, once you get the tour and put your bag away. The rest of us will meet us up on the roof.‚Äù He stated and guided me around the grounds of the company 8 base. Soon enough we headed over to the bunk rooms where he opened the door. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your roommate, play nice.‚Äù He said to the figure inside.

‚ÄúOh! Right.‚Äù I say as I bowed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù I stated humbly I wanted to make a good impression on the team after all.

Idea 5: Demon Slayer.

(Recently I went to go see the Mugen train movie and it‚Äôs reignited my love for this series, so I felt the need to include it for sure! This will be open to both OC and canon characters so feel free to jump in as either one! My character will be a member of the demon slayer corps who is on a near impossible mission in a small village.)

Starter: I panted heavily as I clutched at the wound in my right side. My shaking left hand clutched tightly to the hilt of my blade. This mission had been easy to start with, but the reports were wrong. I had also gotten carless and sloppy due to the fact I had been up for three days straight. Something was luring an incredible mass of Demons to this town and I was tasked to find out what‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt know there would be this many. I tried to regulate my breathing and compose myself even though my body felt as though it would give at any moment. In front of me was a horde of demons, and my eyes studied them waiting for any sign of movement among them. Behind me laid a mass of slain demons which had all been decapitated and were in the process of evaporating.

Checking the hand on my side I didn‚Äôt need to look down to feel that it had dampened with blood. I cursed under my breath my thoughts wandering to the possibility that this might be my final fight. I knew that if I made it to dawn which was only a short time away that I might be able to make it, although that was only a thin sliver of hope.

This was a mission that seemed to have no end, and even though I‚Äôd asked for help from HQ I knew it‚Äôd be some time before they got here‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt even sure how long ago that was‚Ä¶ My thoughts questioned if even a Hashira would have problems with this mission.

I had to keep fighting‚Ä¶ fight till there was no life left in me. And as the surge of demons rushed forth once again, I exhaled. Steadying my breathing as the winds around me changed. ‚ÄúFirst form: Dust Whirlwind Cutter‚Äù I called out as I surged forward slicing through the closest demons and giving myself another moment to breathe. However, my feet were shaky and I stumbled slightly. Many of the demons who noticed my weakening form began to laugh almost in a taunting and mocking manner as they stepped towards me once again.

Idea 6: Attack on Titan.

(So this‚Äôll be a run of the mill attack on titan RP. It‚Äôll be action and adventure based. I‚Äôll probably stick to the start of the story right after everyone meets the scouts. Although I think for this RP, I‚Äôll make the scouts different, having a different leader who is a little more corrupt and willing to frugally send troops to their deaths. As for my character I‚Äôm unsure if I‚Äôll make him a titan shifter or not. Also, if you want to play multiple canon characters that‚Äôs great!)

Starter: There was a solid ‚Äúthunk‚Äù as my hooks embedded themselves into the woody flesh of a tree and I reeled myself onto the branch. I panted heavily as I felt the warm, almost boiling titan‚Äôs blood evaporating from my cheeks and looked down to the corpse of the last titan I‚Äôd killed which was now steaming.

Between heavy breaths of air, I wiped the back of my hand against my forehead wiping away fat beads of sweat and slicked back my ginger hair from my eyes while my blue eyes looked out to the large forest below. It seemed that no matter how many titans were killed more and more kept coming.

‚ÄúDamnit how did I get stuck on this mission?‚Äù I questioned out loud as I tapped on my gas cylinders to feel that they were empty‚Ä¶ not to mention I was down to my last few blades. ‚ÄúDid they really expect us to set up a forward base in this shithole? And just where the hell is the supply unit?‚Äù I speak out loud. A familiar ‚ÄúThunk‚Äù of hooks embedding themselves into wood snapped me from my despairing thoughts.

I looked down to the clearly female form of another scout as she reeled herself towards the sturdy branch I was sitting on and not wanting to scare her if she hadn‚Äôt seen me peeked my head over. ‚ÄúYou need a hand?‚Äù I asked as I reached down my hand to help her up onto the branch.

Idea 7: Fairy Tail

(It‚Äôs been a little while since I‚Äôve seen this series, but I‚Äôve always thought the girls were cute and I loved it! Given my time away from it, I might need some time to refamiliarize myself with how magic works, but I‚Äôm probably going to make him a lot like the character in fire force, a strong/fast attacker who uses fire. He‚Äôll be an entry level member to the guild to begin with.)

Starter: Another day in magnolia and another party being held at the large guild building at the centre of town. A large-scale job had just finished with some of the senior ranking wizards. and even though I wasn‚Äôt part of that mission, instead being on my own D-Rank job I joined in on the celebrations.

I had only been part of the guild for a couple of weeks and so far, it‚Äôs not been as exciting as I‚Äôd hoped, although I figured that it‚Äôd pick up once I proved myself. I was drinking by myself when I was approached by Makarov. He was wearing an eccentric looking orange outfit. ‚ÄúSchwarzer my boy!‚Äù He said as he patted me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúHow are you fitting in?‚Äù He questioned.

‚ÄúFine sir! Everyone has been very welcoming.‚Äù I say to him in response.

‚ÄúGlad to hear it! You‚Äôve been doing a good job, although I‚Äôd like to see you do more.‚Äù The male said. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve arranged a partner for you on your next job, that way you can take on something more challenging, what do you say?‚Äù He questioned.

‚ÄúYes of course!‚Äù I say eagerly as a smile spread across my face.

‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù He said cheerfully. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll introduce you to who you‚Äôll be working with.‚Äù He said as he stood from his spot and led the way over to a female clearing his throat loud enough to get their attention.

Idea 8: Naruto

(So for this one I like the idea that my character is a nomadic mercenary from the cloud village who uses lightning release to increase his speed. He is hired by the leaf to help the ninja of the village on a mission, maybe he also has some kind of hidden power that boosts his chakra but also increases his libido. Not too sure how I wanna go about this one.)

Starter: The Hokage Tsunade Senju looked over me with a curious gaze and then down to my application form. I had been summoned to the village for a mission, but I wasn‚Äôt told what other than the fact that the pay was good. The older woman eyed me up with an air of suspicion as she held up the paper before studying my face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre younger than I expected given everything you‚Äôve done.‚Äù She stated honestly. ‚ÄúBut the intelligence division did a thorough search into you and your village. You check out.‚Äù She stated as she slammed the approved stamp down onto my paper.

‚ÄúJust remember, if you do anything to endanger this village, I‚Äôll snuff you out personally.‚Äù She said in an icy and threatening tone. Feeling a cold bead of sweat roll down the side of my face I nodded. ‚ÄúOf course. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of it.‚Äù I say. Internally I make a mental note not to cross her in any way.

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù She said putting a smile across her features. ‚ÄúYour team is going to be assembled at the gate by sundown.‚Äù She stated. Here‚Äôs a key to your lodgings at the hotsprings inn.‚Äù She stated as she handed me a key. ‚ÄúMake sure you‚Äôre not late.‚Äù She started with her same warning tone.

I nodded as I took the key and smiled at the woman. ‚ÄúUnderstood, thank you.‚Äù I say as I gathered up my things and headed over to the inn. It was beautiful and the warm air of the hot springs was inviting. Although given that it was late afternoon already, I didn‚Äôt have much time to soak. I unpacked my gear and soon headed through the winding paths of the village reaching the gate as sundown began to set in. There I saw three lone female forms and gave them an awkward smile. ‚ÄúHey guys, I‚Äôm here to help you out on your mission.‚Äù I told them.

Idea 9: Bleach

(So a new human soul reaper makes it into the soul society. His power isn‚Äôt captain level to begin with simply being enough to take out the average hollow. And with the resurgence of the hollow threat the Soul Society has offered to give him a substitute badge to take out those hollows deemed too small for the soul society to handle. Maybe he‚Äôs paired up with someone or someone like Orihime steps in to help him grow.)

Starter: Another boring day at college followed by a night of boring patrols. With all the big hollows being taken care of by ‚ÄúFull-fledged‚Äù Soul reapers it didn‚Äôt leave me with much opportunity to train against bigger enemies.

At least that‚Äôs what I thought originally. A few blocks from me there was a rift which opened up and the pure spiritual pressure that came from the hollow that stepped out of it was enough to make me feel as though gravity itself was pushing against me.

It was hard to breathe and even harder to stand as my hand clutched my blade in my left hand tightly. I shook my head as I heard the loud roar of the large breast and could even see it‚Äôs towering form from my position.

It was nothing close to a menos, but it was enough to tower over a three-story building for sure. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù I hissed to myself as I knew there were no soul reapers around at this stage. With a threat this big I was sure they‚Äôd come, but until then it was up to me to buy some time and make sure no humans or souls were consumed.

Pushing myself forward I reached the park that the Hollow had appeared in. Thankfully the park was deserted at this time of night.

When he saw me, the hollow let out a low growl. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt smell like much, but you‚Äôll do as a snack.‚Äù The hollow commented as it charged forward.

‚ÄúJust evade, buy time.‚Äù I commented to myself as I began to leap around the battlefield looking a bit like and feeling like an idiot.

The hollow toyed with me a little while enjoying the chase before it seemed to get bored. Just when I was thinking I was fast enough to keep avoiding it the creature‚Äôs mouth opened and its forked tongue shot out at me with faster speed than I was anticipating. I raised my blade to defend myself but it was a feeble attempt and I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be enough.

Idea 10: Sword Art Online.

(Fairly simple it‚Äôs SAO set in the original death game. I love the idea, so I‚Äôve always loved rping this one. If you want to play canon characters my favorite is for sure Lizbeth, but I‚Äôm open to OC characters!)

Starter: It‚Äôs been months since Akihiko Kayaba has trapped us into this death game. Or at least that‚Äôs how some people looked at it. Others saw it as their dream come true. But most if not, all wanted to push forward and beat the game.

Despite the desire to push forward little progress has been made. Guilds and parties have formed to push through dungeons but with the increased danger and with it more deaths; more and more people simply decided to live out their lives on the lower floors.

Unlike those rushing in to push through the content I was happy enough to go through it at my own pace. This place was like a dream for me, save for the fact I had an increased chance of dying. I was able to live in this game without the worries of the outside world.

I was doing some late-night grinding in an area of dense forest. The sun had set and there was little light save for the bright moon poking through the trees. All was calm, the trees swayed with the wind and the occasional sound of creatures moving about was enough to calm me.

However, the deeper I got into the forest the louder a sound became. At first it was quiet but as I approached, I heard it more clearly. It sounded like steel clashing against steel. Someone was fighting. Moving from a casual walk into a jog I quickly came to a small clearing where I saw two figures fighting, although in the low light I couldn‚Äôt make it out until I got closer.

Idea 11: Avatar the Last Airbender.

(So for this one I guess it can go two different ways. My favorite girls from Avatar would probably be Ty Lee, Suki and Toph. Maybe my character is a powerful bender that either the fire nation or team Avatar wants on their side. I think it might be cool to think that Aang isn‚Äôt the only airbender and instead a small faction managed to escape and continue the lineage. Either that or my character is a powerful firebender of some kind. I‚Äôll leave whichever you prefer to you in your first reply as I‚Äôll leave it open ended.)

Starter: The world was at war ever since the Fire nation attacked. With the intense fighting came mercenaries. Freelance benders or soldiers ready to fight on either side. For a fee of course. And despite my age, being only eighteen I was quite renowned amongst the other bounty hunters for my bending.

Of course, there were talks of the Avatar returning, having repelled an invasion in the south pole, the liberation of Omashu and then the fire nation prison. It seemed they were making quite the stir in the earth kingdom.

It‚Äôd only be a matter of time before they reached the small town, I was in. Perhaps they were already here. But if that was the case surely there would be some kind of stir. Pushing my hair from my face I ordered another drink from the barkeep.

‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre my favourite customer Schwarzer‚Ä¶. You‚Äôre the only one who consistently pays his tab. Unlike the rest of these soldiers or the workers around here.‚Äù The older man says in clear annoyance.

‚ÄúWell who knows, if I wasn‚Äôt so successful, I‚Äôd probably mooch off you too.‚Äù I admitted with a grin. ‚ÄúTry not to talk too ill of the soldiers on either side.‚Äù I added on flicking him an extra coin for a tip once my drink was finished. ‚ÄúWell I better check if anyone has a job for me.‚Äù I say as I push myself up from my seat.

Idea 12: Persona (Girls from 3, 4 and 5).

(So basically this is just gonna be a fairly interesting idea. My character along with the girls of persona 3, 4 and 5 get stranded in this strange dimension where they have to fight their way out to make it back to their own worlds.)

Starter: It all happened so fast. One minute I was in a team meeting with my group discussing what we should use our newfound powers for next. And the next second, I blinked and I was in some kind of strange room.

One by one more people were added into this room. Some of which were dressed in some elaborate costumes. And I frowned as I looked at each one of them, all of which I didn‚Äôt recognize at all and judging by their looks they didn‚Äôt recognize me. Although before we managed to introduce ourselves a booming voice broke the silence.

‚ÄúWelcome all!‚Äù The clearly male voice commented. ‚ÄúTo the room of my design.‚Äù He added on. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all confused. And no doubt you‚Äôll want to return back to your homes. However, to do so you‚Äôll need to enter my labyrinth. ‚ÄúMake it to the end and you‚Äôll all return home.‚Äù The voice explained.

‚ÄúOf course, this maze isn‚Äôt without its dangers. Enemies, much like you encounter on a regular basis will roam these halls. As well as beasts of my own design far stronger than those‚Ä¶ Fear not though for every checkpoint you reach this room will become more furnished with amenities. For now, you simply have beds to rest on.‚Äù He said as there was an audible click and the dark room was suddenly lit up. Sure, enough there were rows of beds all lined up one for each person to sleep on.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre ready to test yourself, step through this door and enter the first level of the labyrinth.‚Äù He declared as a large door appeared and opened up in front of them.

For a while nobody said anything, probably all too stunned to even process the information. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre all persona users given what he just said.‚Äù I spoke up. ‚ÄúI guess we should probably start with names and strengths, right?‚Äù I questioned the group. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Chris Schwarzer.‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúMy persona Serapth focuses on ranged combat.‚Äù I explained.

Idea 13: Final Fantasy VII (Others can be done).

(So this one will be set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, however if you‚Äôre looking to do others, I‚Äôm more than happy to do so! But this one will be focused on FF VII, Jessie, Tifa and Aerith are best girls!)

Starter: Midgar. Easy place to find work given you were capable enough. There were a lot of monsters prowling the highways between sectors and a lot of people willing to pay mercenaries to get the job done.

‚ÄúHiyah!‚Äù I called out as I cleaved my blade through the neck of a monster severing its head from the rest of its body and slaying it instantly. It was a tough fight but I overcame it. I panted a little as my muscles relaxed and I slid my blade back into its sheath. The job I was on was simple, kill the beast and return its head to a barkeep in sector 5. I scooped the beast‚Äôs head up into a burlap sack and hoisted it over my shoulder before I headed back to the bar.

By this point I was a rather well-known mercenary by trade. Job‚Äôs exterminating monsters were easy to come by and easy enough to complete. Plus, the payout paid for my room and for most of my meals. As I entered the bar I headed up to the counter and placed the bloody burlap sack on the counter. ‚ÄúGot it done.‚Äù I say to the barkeep.

The older man, his hair and beard white with age frowned a little and looked at the bag. The blood splatter on the counter‚Ä¶ which he had just cleaned was enough to let him know that I was serious and he placed the sack full of gil on the counter.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I say as I picked up the purse. It was lighter than I expected, but even if it was short I wasn‚Äôt about to start an argument. In return to my manners, I got a short grunt back.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôtcha forget about disposin of that thing, I ain‚Äôt want it.‚Äù He said waving his hand dismissively towards the bag.

‚ÄúRight, I‚Äôll get on that.‚Äù I say as I grabbed the sack.

‚ÄúAn there was a woman lookin for you.‚Äù He stated. ‚ÄúSaid she‚Äôd be waitin for you in buildin next to the orphanage.‚Äù He stated.

‚ÄúRight, thanks.‚Äù I said to the man and headed out, disposing quickly of the severed head in the sack before I headed up to the building in question. I frowned as I peered inside. My eyes looking around for any sign of someone out of place. It did seem a little crowded in the building after all. I was about to announce myself when I felt a hand tap my shoulder and turned to see who it was.

Idea 14: The Witcher 3.

(So my character will be a Witcher. (wow!) Saving people, hunting things you know? The family business. Anyway, I‚Äôm gonna leave it super open ended for you to come in however you like! If you wanna play a canon character my top two are for sure Ciri and Trist, and OC characters are accepted too!)

Starter: A Werewolf, an odd and rare contract, although I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be a hard one. In fact, I figured with my silver blade that the creature would go down rather quickly. Starting the encounter, I was faced with a harsh reality due to my hubris. I started off well enough, however due to my carelessness I was quickly on the backfoot.

The beast roared as it swung its large clawed hand towards me. I had barely managed to roll out of the way of the attack. Probably due to the increasing levels of blood loss resulting in a careless action on my part. A level of confidence quickly pushed down by the fact a handful of open wounds stung at my flanks.

More scars for later given that I make it out of here, although with my silver blade thrown on the other side of the area leaving me with only a steel sword which barely even phases the thing. I had to reach my blade, although with my focus on dodging the attacks it was hard to find an opening to do so.

I raised a hand and cast the igni sign launching flames at the creature who leapt back and I tried my best to make it past the creature only to have to dodge another strike as the beast recovered remarkably fast. ‚ÄúStubborn bastard, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù I questioned a little sourly.

Idea 15: Harry Potter.

(So to keep this one interesting I‚Äôm thinking of having it set in an AU where Voldemort and Harry don‚Äôt exist. However, there are still dark wizards who are part of a cult around. Defs looking for a Hermionie, Luna or Ginny, you could even have other celebs/ecelebs as teachers or students for this one! Ocs are of course welcome too!)

Starter: Another year at Hogwarts, the last for some; and another year of learning was right around the corner. Although times were not peaceful in the wizarding world. Aurors who were the police of the magical world were going missing or showing up dead.

The ministry not wanting to make a panic kept it fairly under wraps, however some of the families have come forward with the information and rumours abound about what was really happening.

Stepping off the train I sighed a little rubbing my temple where a headache had begun to set in. During the train ride here, I found myself stuck next to a boy who wouldn‚Äôt stop going on about the rumours and conspiracy theories.

Glad to be off the train I looked around for a minute lost as to where I needed to go. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs around here somewhere.‚Äù I commented, although my sense of direction was always off. Usually I followed everyone else. But this time it seemed I was one of the last ones off the train.

Closing Words: And that is everything done! If you‚Äôve read this far, I want to give a big thanks! And if you have any questions or suggestions or even criticisms, I‚Äôm open to hearing them. I know this was probably a big read so thanks again for your time and I hope to talk to some of you soon! Also I just want to state it again

How the universe prepared me to catch a demon (My family's guardian angel is not an angel Part-2),"Before my family got an angel, that is definitely no angel, I had met a few people that seemed to prime me for my encounter with our new friend. Of course, not all of them were the type of help you would expect. In fact, not all of them were alive.

&amp;#x200B;

You see my parents moved shortly after I entered high school into a old ""new house"". I guess they were trying to get back to nature or something moving all the way out there. This is where the family started dealing with things that don't make sense in this world. AS I had mentioned before, my sisters could hear things moving even though everyone was sleep. The dogs would be looking into certain rooms and just start growling for hours. It was until a year or so after we moved in that we found out that one of the previous owners ended himself in the house after his divorce. Suddenly the ONE new wall in the living room made perfect sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this time I was still an alter server at the local church. Though I can't say I'm devout enough to be a priest, not by a long shot, but I still did my part. While there I asked the priest if there was anything I could do to calm things down, as the noises and things were getting worse. He instructed me on what I could do, and it was quite simple really. Going through each room of the house, attic to basement or the other way around, would help until he did a proper excursus. While I did so I could actually feel the tension as I went from room to room in a constant prayer. By the time I had gotten to the final room I could feel something fighting my every step as though something was going to hurt me if I continued. As I performed the sign of the cross I could feel the dread, tension, and malice drain from the area. I informed the priest of this before his visit and he even said the house was clear before he even opened his bag. There was a bit of confusion in his eyes, and something else. Thinking back I might have been taken in by the church if he had still been alive when I came of age.

&amp;#x200B;

Later on, at my first real job, there was a young woman that claimed to be a satanist. Though this one wasn't much the things she talked about gave me a little insight into all the paranormal stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

When I went to college I met the one that really let me know what was up. On our first date she claimed to be a witch, and even said she agreed to go out with me because she ""felt something"" when we were close. At the time I chalked it up to late teen hormones, but that was before she did something weird.

&amp;#x200B;

After talking for a few hours she asked if we could conduct an experiment. Being the dumb kid I was I said ""sure"" and she took my hands. She asked me to calm my mind as best as I could and I relaxed. I though this was going to be where we started to make out, but something far different happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

I began to see a long dark tunnel with, what looked like, distant stars around it and flying by. This only took a few seconds before I could see my self walking through a forest. I could kind of see people to my left and right, dressed in that old brown uniform. I didn't know if it was world war 1 or 2 at the time, but I just kept walking through this forest with light undergrowth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Without warning I could see the flashes from the muzzle of a full automatic machine gun and, almost in slow motion, I could feel the pain of a large caliber bullet hit me in the upper left chest. Knowing what I do now that would have caused a collapsed lung if not treated, but that wasn't the last thing I saw. Still in a sort of slow motion the impact threw me back forcing my head to lower as well. The blood shot out of the hole left by the bullet and seemed to launch a good four inches out of my chest. Still looking down I could see a rifle come out of my hands that I didn't even realize I was carrying. Thinking about it, it looked like a type of bolt action rifle. I don't know but it clearly wasn't a carbine or Thompson I can tell you that. In that moment she jumped back, breaking contact with my hands, and I fell back off the chair and flat on my back. 

&amp;#x200B;

Jumping up I started checking to see if I was actually shot. Once I saw I was clean I looked over at her as she lay on her side, curled up in the fetal position on my bed. I was still catching my breath from the shock as I asked her why she was crying. Her only response was ""I just saw you die."" which was more than enough to give me pause. 

&amp;#x200B;

We tried to make sense of the experience but soon enough moved onto other things. On other dates she would teach me about how witches operate and that not all of them are actually bad. As she put it ""It depends on how you manipulate energy."" which made me totally lost. I mean I know my basic physics but that went right over my head. Though to put it simply many witches do not want to put the time in to gain power over time. Many try to steal power form others, or from animals to quickly jump to a higher level. They do this without understanding that even in the paranormal there is cause and effect. Although I could just say ""karma can be a bitch"" to hammer that point home. This is why the move evil the witch the more is taken from them and the less they remain human. 

&amp;#x200B;

She didn't mind putting the work in if it meant keeping her safe from the things that might do her harm. Though I still couldn't get her to carry a knife to aid in that endeavor. Especially when we found out a universal truth about the kind of things she was researching. Any type of creature that has the ability to cross over to our physical reality HAS to follow the same rules as us. 

&amp;#x200B;

In this revelation we realized that once a being is trying to physically harm you it can be harmed, or even killed by the same means as everything else. This made us wonder why anyone would run from these kinds of things when they come for you. The answer escaped us for along time, but was so obvious that I actually hit myself in the head when we figured it out. It was the 'fight or flight instinct' kicking in just like it would if a gator jumped out of the water at you when you didn't see it. Few people would even think to fight something like that, let alone something they have never seen before. Though there was one cavoite to this, and that was the fact that they are still tethered to the astral plane. This means that the faithful still wield power that can hurt, incapacitate, or even end creatures that are crossing over. This led us to the only criptid hunt I have ever been on. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are wondering why I would agree to this, just remember that I was about 18 or 19 and she was my first real girlfriend. A petite little pale and pretty thing that pretty much had me going wherever she wanted. Yup, we've all been there at least once.

&amp;#x200B;

We got a few of her friends together, mine didn't want anything to do with this even when I offered to get beer, and headed to a location that was known to be a hot spot for a criptid. The town itself was nearly abandoned and the few remaining residents were just waiting for their checks to clear before they could leave. Being an old manufacturing town there was a lot of old factory buildings to explore on the far side of town. Over the past few years several people reported seeing a creature that seemed to move with the shadows that had a penchant for stealing pets and the occasional person. Most people outside the town would just think the person moved out, but the folks in the town seemed to think different. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we stopped to get drinks and snacks at the local fuel station a few of the kids inquired about the criptid. The guy behind the counter had a big smile when we came in, but that dropped off his face in a second when we asked about the thing they saw. He was hesitant for a while, but a few well placed bills and some flirting from the girls got him to open up. He told us where it had been seen the most, but warned us that others had gone in to find it and had not all come back out. One story stuck in my mind was about a group of six going into the area and the next day the only thing left was their gear, their car, and some blood. From that point most people stayed away. One of the more 'alpha' guys of our group shrugged it off with ""Scary old man, now which way is it""? I shot him a look as my hand rubbed the knife hanging off my belt. He saw this and retreated outside while we apologized, paid for our items, and left.

&amp;#x200B;

You would think the area we were going to would be far outside of town, but nope. It took us less than five minutes to be pulling into the overgrown parking lot of the facility. As I stepped out my senses were suddenly on high alert, along with one other in the group. She was new to the group but seemed to be even more sensitive to this stuff than me. So much so that she almost had to be dragged inside as we looked around. 

&amp;#x200B;

The place was exactly what you would expect from an old factory. The machinery was rusting, and the place smelled horrible. More than half the windows had either been busted out or had fallen out. Judging from the wood and style of construction the place had to be at least fifty years old. I was beginning to worry about the structural integrity of the place more than anything we might find in there. 

&amp;#x200B;

The smell of urine, feces, old burned oil, mold, and God knows what else made us glad the windows were more than half busted. Although it was still a strong enough smell that we had to step out for air more than once. While a few of us looked around for any critters that might be dangerous the others set up their circle in hopes of drawing out what they thought was there. The candles seemed to help with the smell as the flames burned off some of the more pungent odors. It was about an hour after we got there that they started on their chants.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is were it would have been really nice to know what the hell we were searching for. I knew there was something to be worried about, but I had no idea why the hairs on the back of my neck were standing up. Without even knowing it my hand was grasped on the handle of my knife, which was a 7 1/2 inch solid chunk of stainless steel, while the other was on the flashlight looking around. By then it had gotten dark, and looking back I would have killed for some night vision. On the other side of my belt was the 1911 my father had purchased for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was well after midnight and they still chanted. It was to the point I was wondering if their voices would hold out. It was then that we heard glass break and the car alarm go off. It only took a few second for us to react and run to the side and look out. We got there just as something big and dark ran from the van, past right in front of us by about thirty feet, and disappeared into the night. It wasn't until that point that I realized we might be up against something truly dangerous. 

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at the other guys and we backed into the center where the chanting was. We backed into the center so that the candles would give us some additional light. Without thinking those of us with firearms drew them and held them in that TV way cops do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lights moved rapidly around as we could hear things moving around. Those chanting kept going, though I don't know if it was fear or desperation. We then saw something moving and we turned our weapons at it. This thing seemed to take shape from the shadows as it moves in a silent glide toward the circle. This thing was not the same thing we saw outside. This thing was not from the physical plane. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the guys put his hands up and motioned us to lower out pistols while saying ""That's not going to work."" and he was right. This think had not reached the point of physical yet which means we can't hurt it. It reached out to the group and seemed to be stopped cold by the circle of salt, and other materials, that surrounded us. It slowly pressed itself against the side of the circle seemingly spreading like a giant ink blot against the side. 

&amp;#x200B;

The one that had stopped us from shooting started hold his hands and preying in a language I didn't understand. Next to me was the other guy with a pistol and he just said one word "" Jikininki"". I recognized that and asked ""Aren't the japaneese?"" to which he just shrugged. Hearing the young man prey reminded me of what I could do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Putting my pistol away I started to prey too. Using the lords prayer I forced it to recede back to its original size. In fact, though I don't know if it was just me, the dammed thing seemed to lose all ability to stay upright. Its body seemed to slump down and lay on its side, though it seemed to be trying to reach the darkest shadows that it came from. This is when the chanting changed. I don't know what they were saying, my Latin isn't good at all, but the change in chant seemed to weaken it even more. To the point that my girlfriend turned to us and said ""Now you can kill it"". 

&amp;#x200B;

It was still reaching for the shadows, but didn't seem to have the ability to go back into them. In fact, it had been severed from its power and was now easy pray. As I 'unclenched' and reached for my pistol we received a shock.

&amp;#x200B;

Without warning something massive dropped down right on top of it and seemed to rip it in half. For a moment I thought it was a giant black bear, at lest until it turned its head to us. Those deep yellow eye looked at us with both thanks and malice. In its mouth was the center of that shadow being as the shadow seemed to slowly disintegrate. The other two parts of the shadow seemed to do the same as it seemed to almost evaporate in a matter of seconds. We might have just dealt with something that was not of this world, but if we didn't change gears quick this criptid was going to have us for dinner...  literally!

&amp;#x200B;

We didn't think at that point as both pistols rang out into the night. My quick draw might not be great but there is no way of missing something that big at that range. Before most of us could blink it had jumped back into the darkness, and both pistols needed to be reloaded. A few tried to start chanting again and it was my turn to tell them ""That's not going to work."" as I released the slide of my 45. I still remember the release from the other guys 9mm as we looked at each other and seemed to talk without saying a word. We got nearly back to back as we searched the area for that big bastard. 

&amp;#x200B;

We could hear it moving around and my girlfriend got up to stand next to me. I used my free hand to draw my knife to hand it to her. She actually looked at me and said ""I don't like knives."" where I retorted ""I'm not asking."" while shoving it into her hand. We could hear it moving around us, in fact it sounded like more than one. 	

&amp;#x200B;

Thankfully one of the girls had a father who was a police officer. She could tell that it was staying up in the rafters while throwing stuff down to confuse us. TO this day I am impressed at how calm she was, because I was ready to piss my pants. 

&amp;#x200B;

It must have heard her because it came running into the light right at her. We fired into it as soon as it got into view. Apparently it can't remain stealthy when it is charging. My seven bullets and his fifteen were almost defining as we fired a full magazine each into it as it charged. Though we clearly hurt it, the dam thing was still able to slash the girl that figured this mutt out. Even though the cuts weren't too deep she still needed the wounds tended to. Call us dumb kids if you want but we did bring a first aid kit with us. 

&amp;#x200B;

With both weapons now loading their final magazines my heart was beating through my sternum. I wouldn't be surprised if they could see it, but I'm sure the others were just as scared of this thing. It was smart, really smart, and it had just taken four magazine's of bullets and barely even slowed down. I know I had to hit it in the face at least once since it did scream in pain when we shot it, but at that moment I was wondering if we had enough ammo left to take it down. 

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend had removed her top to put pressure on the girls wounds. I know she wasn't all that shy, but I wonder if they could have used anything else to stem the bleeding. That is when we heard the most odd sound. It was like rapid breathing mixed with a half cough coming from the darkness. The guy next to me cursed and fired in the direction he thought it was. When I asked ""What are you doing?"" he responded with ""That son of a bitch is laughing at us""! Without skipping a beat the girl on the ground bleeding looked up and said ""I don't think calling a werewolf a 'son of a bitch' is a very good insult""? I regret not thanking her for the chuckle we all desperately needed at that moment. Once he thought about the insult he ripped out some new ones that were quite colorful. Now I don't know if this thing got mad or what, but it wasn't hiding anything as it charged again.

&amp;#x200B;

This time it backhanded the two of us shooting at it as we unloaded on it. I could see blood squirt out of the holes from my bullets but it didn't seem to care. That massive arm swung hitting the other shooter first and knocking him out as it knocked me over. As it landed it reached with its other hand and grabbed my girlfriend and bounded into the darkness.

&amp;#x200B;

She was screaming as I scrambled to my feet screaming her name. I could hear her screaming as I got up and ran into the darkness after her. The others were yelling at me to stay, but I was gone before they could stop me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her screams were still inside the factory, but getting farther away by the moment. As I stumbled through the darkness to were I could hear her screaming I could feel that the slide was locked back meaning I was out of ammo. I paused for a second as I thought about what I could do, and that is when I heard it. The wolf howled in a clearly pain filled matter. Under the howl was my girlfriend screaming at it. At least she was still alive. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is when I remembered a 'good luck charm' my uncle had give me. I quietly said ""du"" as I reached into my shirt and pulled out the silver cartridge. Ripping it from the chain I prayed that it was the right size. Good thing he is a 45 type of guy like me. I put the bullet into the magazine and shoved the magazine into the pistol before hearing something I really didn't want to hear. It sounded like taring and my girl screaming in fear. Taking off again I chambered the round and then realized it might be a dummy round, but hearing everything going on my body moved before my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before reaching the far side of the factory her cries had stopped. At that moment desperation disappeared and rage took its place. The dam light of my flashlight leading the way to my final destination.

&amp;#x200B;

Turning the corner to the only noise on that side of the factory I saw something that instantly burned into my mind. This massive thing was 'assaulting' her the way no one should ever be assaulted. He was above her in a way that her head was almost perfectly facing me. She wasn't making any noise and her eyes were fixed as her body moved back and forth. In that moment I didn't know if that look was pleasure, pain, or shock in any case I couldn't think. That bastard just looked up at me as soon as I turned the corner and laughed.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't remember thinking. All I know is I raised the pistol and pulled trigger. Even after the round went off I kept pulling over and over again as though that would make another bullet magically enter the chamber. The bullet struck this thing in the chest and it fell back and started screaming in pain. It jumped up, or at least tried to with a knife sticking out of its upper thigh, and ran off yelping and screaming in pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Silently I thanked my uncle, even though he wasn't around anymore, before going to my girl. I used my shirt to cover her as best as I could and tried to make my way back to the group. I say try because when I shot that thing I dropped the flashlight and that seemed to severely lower the amount of light coming out. the flashlight died before we got back to the group. 

&amp;#x200B;

Walking up to them I told them what happened and since the very first glimmer of daylight was coming we decided to get the hell out of there. Though with the damage to the van it would be another hour before we could go anywhere. Once we jerry-rigged the van we headed to the fuel station to get the parts we need to make it back to civilization. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we walked in there was no one behind the counter, but the lights were still on and the door was open. We grabbed what we needed, threw some cash on the counter and went to work on the van. As we did two SUV's pulled in and tried to get fuel. They didn't say anything until one walked up to the busted side of the van. He pulled off a small clump of fur and called for his buddies. I don't know if they were just well mannered, or that they saw that at least two of us were armed, but they were very polite as they asked if we 'had a rough night'? Even back then I could smell government on someone so I was quiet at first, but that was the wrong answer. One of the girls told him to run because of a monster, but they said they were here to stop it. 

&amp;#x200B;

They produced badges I had never seen before, or since, and claimed they were sent to stop the threat. I told them to ""prove it"" and slammed open the van door showing them our wounded. This put them in high gear as they produced very large, and very full, medical bags. It was clear they knew what they were doing while the others started probing us with questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

We told them everything we could or the contingent that they get our wounded to a hospital as fast as possible. Since this was before cell phone were a thing they called on their radio and had a helicopter landed in less than ten minutes. With those two taken care of we told the men everything down to the last detail. By the time we were done explaining their polite dispositions had changed into an extremely professional demeanor. I could see that they had rage in their eyes like me. Before they left I ran over to the one I thought was in charge and said ""Hey, when you find that shit stain. Make it hurt""! He just nodded and they tore out of the station in the direction of the factory. The rest of us didn't talk the entire ride back.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be over a week before I saw the cops daughter back in class. Our conversation was limited to a quick check on each others health and wondering how my girl was doing. Since this was before social media I couldn't get any information. When I tried to call her parents they didn't want to talk to me. They only yelled about how I was supposed to protect her. At that point all I could do was carry on.

&amp;#x200B;

About two weeks after the whole ordeal I received a package in the mail. I wasn't expecting anything this close to the end of the semester so I was curious. Inside was my stainless steel knife, a mangled silver bullet, and a letter.      

&amp;#x200B;

The letter said that the my girl had put up a hell of a fight. The blade was still in the wolf when they caught up to it. She must have listened to the movie that said ""Stick it in his thigh. Twist it, so the wound wont close"". Even though she had hurt it, the additional assault had messed her up mentally. So much so that she was being remanded to a psyc facility on the other side of the country. Even though I knew where it was they wouldn't accept my letters or gifts until she is stable. When that will be is unknown. The next part I remember perfectly. ""The silver you put in it didn't hit anything vital, but it was deep enough that it couldn't cut the bullet out. Due to its effects on a wolf, when they caught up to it, it was like fighting something that had a horrible flu and had not eaten in a week or drank in a day. You can rest assured that after we found him we confronted him on his actions. When we mentioned the girl he smiled as though he was proud. Though our orders are to bring these things in alive, if at all possible, this one will never bother anyone again. Whatever hell it is in now is probably nicer than the last few days of its life. By the way, if you ever want a job just call the number at the bottom"".

&amp;#x200B;

I would only ever call once. I actually burned the letter an hour later, after I put the knife back in its sheath and found a place for the bullet. The bullet would stay there until I made it into another one. I still keep it just in case. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a few years I was finally able to find out what happened to my witch girlfriend. I got tired of the run around from the hospital and called the number from the letter. It turns out that she didn't make it. This news nearly broke me, but at the time I was getting ready for my first deployment and others were counting on me so I had to stay strong. I had left college when I saw the towers fall to join like so many others, so I didn't have time to search into what happened. At least not until a few years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are not the good memories of my past, but they did prepare me to deal with the strange things I would see in my life. Not the lest of which is tapping on my front door right now. I know it is her since she thinks it is cute to just use one finger, no matter how many times I ask her to use the doorbell. I guess I'll go now. Be careful, and be ready to deal with all the things that go bump in the night whether you want them to or not.",FreeToReadCreepypasta,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeToReadCreepypasta/comments/pdbldl/how_the_universe_prepared_me_to_catch_a_demon_my/,,Sin117,pdbldl,/r/FreeToReadCreepypasta/comments/pdbldl/how_the_universe_prepared_me_to_catch_a_demon_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeToReadCreepypasta/comments/pdbldl/how_the_universe_prepared_me_to_catch_a_demon_my/,0,2021-08-28

\*Sigh\*. Goddamnit.¬†That inner voice again.

How many times do I have to go through this?

Do I really have to hear your mouth running about my drunken past over, and over and over again? For the love of humanity, do me a favor and shut your fucking mouth for once!

In this past life¬†already plagued by¬†anger and pain

Knowing that I wasted my life longing to go back¬†in time¬†in order to fix shit without realizing that time is just a one way trip and gives¬†me nothing more than longevity and no do-overs.

Even though I admit that I will never get a chance in hell as a woman in her mid-30s to talk some pure logical sense to my younger self...that has since passed away.

I guess they¬†didn‚Äôt call me the heart-breaker for nothing back in the day, huh?

When it comes to living in a journey of being clean and sober to live a joyous and bountiful life after many years of living under the same roof with Firewater, Hooch, Nightcap, Suds‚Ä¶and Rotgut, going back to the past that is nonexistent is no longer an option to take heed due to the fact that it will threaten my sobriety.¬†

And I‚Äôm afraid that it will derail me on my path to live a much better and healthy lifestyle.

After months of tapering off and workouts from home and in the park, it took me until that Saturday night of July 10, 2021 when I officially woke up from the fog.

After finishing up my last bottle of liquid courage¬†and having a glance through its¬†sticky and sweet emptiness, my final words were said:¬†‚ÄúSorry, buddy. But you‚Äôve ruined my life. I‚Äôve wasted 14 years with your sorry ass and now I‚Äôm paying the price for it.‚Äù

Thrown out of the window from my 5th¬†floor apartment‚Ä¶the freedom begins.

Suffering from sweaty limbs and headaches to

Waking up from nightmares Frightened, worried, and anxious that 

Something¬†is about to come back and cause harm to me

But no one told me‚Ä¶

That there is a chance in the present and future for me after all.

‚Ä¶And that is called moving on.

I have no choice but to forgive my own damn self.

I use to think it was too late at this point.

But,¬†looking back at it now, it‚Äôs better late than never...if you still got time¬†here on Earth.

What I‚Äôve done was unforgivable and unforgettable

I really wish they were the opposite, but they‚Äôre not.

And I‚Äôm sorry. I really am.

Please forgive me for what I have done

I‚Äôm at the point right now where I‚Äôm working very hard to get¬†my health back¬†to normal.

And no, I¬†am not going to hurt myself again¬†for anyone else. Not even you.

If you can‚Äôt accept that I‚Äôve changed¬†for good, then I want you in my sight.

M4F My daughter's friend,"Mike Campbell sat in his office at home, trying to make sense of an email from his boss. He had been working from home since the pandemic, and even when the restrictions were lifted a bit, he opted to stay in his home-office. Mike had not liked working from home at first. He wanted a clear separation between home life with his family and his work. But with time, he got used to it and now he actually liked that he did not need to commute. He had added some decorations and plants to the room, but still his desk and an old couch were the only furniture. The room had only one window, which was not ideal because he usually preferred natural light. But at least the glass had a special coating to reflect the sun and keep out the heat. Sometimes, he felt like a cop behind a one way mirror, because he was able to look out into his garden, but no one could see him inside. 

He was leaning back in his chair, thinking about the email, when a shadow moving along the window caught his attention. He looked outside and was surprised to see Liz in the garden. She had been one of his daughter's friends during high school, but Mike had assumed they had lost contact after going to different colleges. Apparently, they were both home for the summer and reconnected. Liz wore a short sleeved top with black and white stripes and one of these jeans that go well above the waist, showing some skin at her midriff. Her auburn hair was held back by a black headband. 

The girls were setting up some chairs at the small terrace like area of the garden. Hannah put a bottle of sunscreen on the small table and sat down. Mike was ready to go back to his work, he usually tried to give his kids a high degree of privacy, but then his mouth dropped involuntarily. Liz had just taken off her top, revealing a tight blue sports bra. She took the sunscreen an applied it to her arms. Mike could not stop watching. He noticed that her nipples were poking through the fabric of her bra and suddenly, he acted on auto pilot. Mike reached for his smart phone and got closer to the window. Before he realized what he was doing, he was already taking pictures of Liz, who now was applying the sunscreen to her shoulders. One click, two clicks, ten clicks. Liz had no idea he was watching her and continued to innocuously rubbing the sunblocker on herself. Mike's heart skipped a beat when she pulled down the left strap of her bra. Would she take it off, Mike wondered, but then she pulled it back up again, when she was finished with the sunscreen. His thumb was still clicking the button of his photo app and when Liz eventually sat down, Mike checked his phone. He had taken almost 30 pictures of her. He zoomed in on some of them, and her hard nipples were clearly visible in the pictures. He had always had a thing for ""pokies"", but looking at pictures from the internet was no comparison to the rush he was feeling at the moment. 

Mike's smartphone almost slipped from his sweaty fingers. Had he really just done this? His heart was racing. He fumbled with the USB cord trying to connect his phone to the PC. Where could he save those pics? He nervously scanned the directory tree and created a cascade of new folders. A new window opened and the contents of his phone appeared. Quickly, he found the picture folder and copied the pics to the hard drive, immediately deleting the evidence from his phone afterwards. Mike felt dirty, but he knew he would be coming back to those pics later at night once his wife was sleeping. 

----------

Hello DPP! I have been gone for quite some time, but recently I felt the itch to start writing smut again. I would love to find a partner for this indecent pairing of Mike and Liz. He is a married father of two in his late forties. His wife Jessica and he had kids early, so his older daughter Hannah is already in college and his son Jim just finished high school. We can discuss how Mike and Liz look exactly, that's why I did not add a lot of descriptions in the prompt. I would like this to be a story about a guy who has always thought of himself as ""decent and reputable"", but is now discovering his ""perverted"" side. I am down for some ""build up"" with Liz being unaware that he is developing an attraction to her. I would prefer Liz to later realize this and start to tease him relentlessly, before the situation turns into something physical and they start having an affair. 

I write 3rd person, past tense. I usually write parts of 200-800 words. Of course, there are exceptions to this depending on the situation they are in, but yeah, 2-sentence-parts do nothing for me. 

You can expect 2 parts *per week* from me on average, so please be fine with that frequency. OOC talk and chatting can happen a lot more, if that is also your preference. I am fine with talking OOC, but I am also fine to keep OOC to discussing the mechanics and topics of the RP. I am usually not online much during weekends. My time zone is CEST.

*My likes*: being teased, striped clothing/socks, voyeur/exhibitionism (incl. downblouse and upskirt situations), giving oral, BJs, anal (maybe in this case also taking Liz's anal virginity), eating ass, dirty talk. Here is the kinklist: https://i.imgur.com/Ptj88Si.png

*My dislikes*: Unnaturally big or small body parts, things that do not really fit into the RP, and everything mentioned as a limit on my kinklist. I am willing to refrain from my usual ""No yoga pants rule"", though, if you picture Liz wearing one occasionally. 

I am looking forward to your reply. Please tell me a little bit on how you image the RP going and how fast you want to progress.

[M4F] Tiny courier saved by Something/Someone.,"
A forest could seem like an alien world at night. Vizyan couldn't tell if the snow was still falling or if it had just been whipped up by the wind. It howled around him, deafening the courier to his surroundings. The fresh powder stung his exposed skin, like a slap to the face. The lack of light played tricks on his eyes. There always seemed to be something just out sight or at the corners of his vision. Eyes in the darkness watching him progress. Or was that the hypothermia beginning to affect his mind? 


**He had to keep on going.** His mind ordered stubbornly.


 It was too important for him, for all of them, that he didn't stop. On through the snow, the flurries of the blizzard sticking to his hair and blotting out the world, he had to place one foot in front of the other. Each step sunk into perfectly-white snow drifts, bringing with them the possibility to stumble and fall. Every breeze was a lance of cold that pierced his thick cloak. He could feel his fingers and his toes, but only in icy, almost-numb pain.

He'd forgotten long ago just how far it was he had yet to travel. His horse, along with most of his supplies, had been lost as soon as this storm had struck, spinning and tearing out of nowhere and turning the entire world white. He only had the letter, sealed with a yellow wax seal, the most important letter he had ever been courier to. It was held between his hands with a death grip.

Although warmly dressed for such journey, no one could be out in this type of weather for long. The chill had already started to sink into his feet and hands. Frostbite and hypothermia would soon follow. The gravity of the situation began to take hold. *This was the type of weather people died in, a weather I would die in if-*

Once again his mind focused on the letter in his numb fingers, the pain was but a reassurence he still had the strength to go on.

In between moments of fleeting conscious, where he'd try to see where he was, if he was in the Forest of Azrith or still on the chilly lands that somehow separated them from the raging Sapphire Sea, he got the sense of being watched. It was as if something was waiting for him to stumble, waiting for him to crash into the snow and give up. But this letter was too important for that! 

**He had to keep going!** 

**He had to keep going!** 

*He had to keep going. . .*

Vizyan trudged through the knee deep snow. His legs felt like a ton of bricks every time he lifted them. It seemed like every step took more energy than the last as he moved forward. He so very wanted to sit down for a minute and rest. Just a minute before continuing on. A little voice in the back of his mind told him to keep moving. That if he stopped he would never get back up again. Every minute was a struggle to keep moving. This was a game of endurance he knew he would lose.


His duty as a courier clashed with the exhaustion as the cold was slowly finding it's way to break his spirit, after all body was almost gone at this point.


His steps had just begun to waver when he saw it. A figure moving in the dark.



*I'm saved,* he thought. Not even thinking to assume it was a hallucination.



He tried to make a beeline for that small glimmer of hope. If he could just reach them-



As Vizyan got closer he managed to make out only certain features of the ""person"" in the distance


A figure, (Human?) unlike anything he has seen. An inhabitant to these lands? Or perhaps another lost traveler? An apex predator? You know well who you are, what you are, he does not as his body finally gives in just few feet away from you.


***

Thanks for reading. 

After going over one of Sapkowski's books there was a small entry about a courier going on through his day, and needless to say I was somewhat inspired to try and take it for a spin by adding a plot where a courier with similar important task is not necessarily eaten or killed by some monster or inhabitant of the distant land but actually saved by them!

Perhaps you're some Ice Elf or Moutain Orc that lives in these lands?

Some yeti-esque mosnter girl that needs a man (or feminine male I'm open to everything!) to warm her cave/lair/home?

And also the only limit: underage. Everything else up to discussion.

The RP can be heavy on world building if we'd like, perhaps the two set out to deliver the letter with her helping him out? Maybe because he was recovering war comes to the realm and now they're trying to stop it? Or we can ignore that part completely and just focus on smut!",MacroRP,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MacroRP/comments/pda7n6/m4f_tiny_courier_saved_by_somethingsomeone/,,Embarrassed_Cap_5313,pda7n6,/r/MacroRP/comments/pda7n6/m4f_tiny_courier_saved_by_somethingsomeone/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MacroRP/comments/pda7n6/m4f_tiny_courier_saved_by_somethingsomeone/,0,2021-08-28

# What is going into ketosis?

https://preview.redd.it/nlulqmg224k71.jpg?width=750&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3af5fd7d1b4a9403c4b14d777c7088ee03b62b1c

Ketosis is a state in which the body can enter through a metabolic reaction, when it only feeds on the fats that we accumulate. This is because the body needs to ""pull"" reserves (fats) for energy , due to which it is in a state devoid of blood sugar ( glucose ).

# Ketosis Reddit: what is it?

You've probably heard the ketogenic diet referred to as the keto diet as well . This is because ketosis comes from ketosis. Keto refers to the ketones that are created when a catabolic window of the fats we store opens and we put ourselves into a state of ketosis.

However, the ketogenic state does not only occur when we are on a ketogenic diet:

Nutritional ketosis also occurs when we practice some type of intermittent fasting , or at its extreme, when we stop eating. For example, severe cases of anorexia live in a constant ketogenic state.

Ultimately, ketosis is a metabolic response that our body is programmed to launch in unfavorable circumstances or malnutrition. Therefore, it does not seem a priori a very healthy option to drastically provoke this, right?

# What is the ketogenic state?

The state of ketogenic is promoted by the creation of ketone bodies . These are essentially shorter fat chains. In other words, it is as if the body prepares the fats that we have stored in the body so that they can be used at any time, since otherwise, we would die.

As I said before, this is due to the absence of glycogen in the blood. That is, the ketogenic state comes as a consequence of a decrease or elimination of carbohydrate intake. Under these conditions, the body obtains energy from ketone bodies instead of extracting it from carbohydrates.

# How do you get into ketosis?

The answer to how to get into ketosis , we've actually already seen it. In short, when we stop eating, our blood glucose levels are so low that we begin to feed on our own fat. There, we have entered cestosis.

# How do I know if I am in ketosis?

There is no reliable way to know if we are in ketosis other than by listening to our own body. As we enter the ketogenic state, our body will begin to bring to mind the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeating.

Over time, these signals may no longer occur, as the body and mind have that ability to adapt.

Is it possible to get out of ketosis and get back in?

Sure, it's actually the idea. We cannot be in a constant ketogenic state. The moment we eat again, we will have glycogen again. This must be so.

# How long does it take to get into ketosis?

https://preview.redd.it/qmmldh9d24k71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6b24da4f5fcab6585dbdc926c09b4c5d4b47875

This will depend on the metabolism of each person, but in a standard way, between 8 and 12 hours will be the time it takes for the body to enter a state of ketosis. This means that after this time our body will have consumed all the energy injected in the last intake.

Obviously, this will also vary depending on the type of food, since for example white pasta produces a rapid discharge of energy and wholemeal pasta, is slow release.

# How to get into ketosis faster?

I'm sorry if I don't answer this question directly, but if necessary, I will refer you to my grandmother's advice: ""Hurry is not good counselor.""

I would wonder, why do I have such an urge to get into ketosis? Why do I want to lose weight fast?

The ketogenic state is something that comes naturally, we don't have to force ourselves to stop eating or exercise too hard to achieve this. Obviously, if you end all the blood sugar in your body, you will get there sooner, however, you do not have to obsess over this.

# Symptoms of nutritional ketosis

When we get into a ketogenic state, the body usually begins to undergo a series of changes. Some symptoms of nutritional ketosis are:

* 1.  Change the nutritional balance : Think what, when we stop taking carbohydrates we also stop taking properties of food that may be necessary. As is the case with fiber. It is common to experience constipation or other digestive problems .
* 2.  Tiredness or exhaustion : Dispense with carbohydrates can mean that we find ourselves lacking in energy and have more sleep, which makes it difficult for us to carry out our daily tasks, etc.
* 3.  Decreased appetite: Our body understands nutritional ketosis as a state of lack of malnutrition due to an absence of possibility to feed ourselves. In that way, it is possible that it inhibits the orientation to feed ourselves, or also called, hunger .
* 4.  Halitosis : Forcing our body to work breaking down fats promotes the secretion of acetone, which is responsible for strong body odor and bad breath.

# Ketogenic diet or Keto diet

The ketogenic diet is a somewhat transgressive approach in the world of nutrition. As we well know, and the WHO has indicated to us actively and passively, it makes no sense to do without carbohydrates in our diet. Although it is true, that there is an abuse of these in the western style of eating.

# Ketosis, diet and fasting

However, carbohydrates are the main energy agent that we have. It is estimated that approximately 60% of the energy we obtain to maintain our organic functions ( basal metabolism ) and for our daily activity, we obtain from carbohydrates.

Carbohydrates cause a discharge of glucose, which once synthesized, is converted into glycogen (blood sugar). When insulin begins to act and / or our glycogen store is exhausted, the body begins to extract energy from other means such as proteins and mainly, fats .

This is how ""fat burning"" occurs. Which is why, if for example, we want to lose weight, it is not advisable to do sports while we have very high blood sugar levels. In this case, we would be consuming that energy, but not burning fat.

*From a pragmatic point of view, we might then think that the ketogenic diet is the best option to lose weight, but is it really so?*

# Is the keto diet a good option?

https://preview.redd.it/nbcbnazk24k71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e17faca4f1b0c77a29e376fc5f1c8d22095c66ae

A study carried out by Yale University has found in a study with mice, that compared to two groups (one fed carbohydrates and the other following a ketogenic diet), the immune system of the second responded better against the virus.

Now it remains to be able to extrapolate its results to humans, we will be attentive.

# Does the ketogenic diet really work?

The latest studies I have consulted suggest that people who start a ketogenic diet have a rapid decrease in body fat during the first two months. However, after this time, a rebound or stagnation effect occurs . Do not be surprised, if you are following this type of diet and when you quit, you start to gain weight for no apparent reason or reason .

The reason for this is that the best way to lose weight is progressively. Think what, if the body is prepared to store fat, it is for something. Formerly, that reservoir was what ensured survival. Because, when the ""lean cows"" arrived, thanks to him, he could continue to have the energy necessary to preserve vital functions.

Although it has been a long time since that, evolution is slow. For our body: a rapid loss of fat is going into vital alarm. The body interprets it as a time of famine and activates the saving mode to consume as little as possible. It can even paralyze some bodily functions.

In addition, you will understand that everything that can be ingested, must be preserved and retained to the maximum (rebound effect).

Do you want to know more about the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting to lose weight? So I recommend you read this article: Does fasting work to lose 10 kilos?

# When do you start losing weight on the ketogenic diet?

This is something gradual, we cannot and should not have the expectation of having found the ketogenic diet with the definitive solution to all our problems.

Fat burning begins from minute zero, however, our body has mechanisms to regulate itself and cause there to be no very pronounced weight gains or losses.

However, it is business as usual, each body is an enigma and responds differently.

Dangers of the ketogenic diet

Another problem associated with the ketogenic diet is the abundant consumption of protein . The WHO recommends that we consume no more than 0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of our body weight.

That is, if for example I weigh 70 kg, I should take about 56 grams of protein per day. Average protein intake on a ketogenic diet can double or triple this amount.

In the long run, high protein intake can cause irreparable damage to the liver and kidneys . And immediately, an infection.

# Types of ketogenic diets

In its origins, the ketogenic diet was aimed at serving health. Theorizing that the consumption of carbohydrates is unnecessary, and that by causing specific states of ketosis, it is possible to promote a detox effect similar to that which occurs when we practice autophagy.

So, this was carried out by reducing the consumption of carbohydrates to the maximum and significantly increasing the consumption of fats.

What is happening today is that many people have taken the ketogenic diet to the field of magic diets to achieve immediate results. For this reason, they decrease their fat intake and only increase their protein intake.

Fading sunlight chapter 4 r/Writestresam,"Good your still here  It means that you have  been  keeping up with me, Keeping up with the story  . When last we left our tale,  our two  entwined souls  seemed to be at an impasse . This was because  Amanda had made a drastic decision that for all intents and purposes destroyed Brian from heart,  to soul, to spirit,  to flesh  . In short  it almost  left  him with a broken heart in the literal sense  . We turn back the clock to 23:50 Zulu Wednesday night. 
  
 

 Brian has just come home from work and finds Amanda peacefully sleeping in bed ,   As the couple spends most of the night in conversation about this and that  . Amanda  felt it  would be a good idea to  inform her friend of the drastic  decision that she decided to make...She has decided to move to  Florida permanently within 2 years  ! Brian simply watched as  the world that was at one point moving slowly  came to a sudden crash ! 

Brian  , for the 2nd  time that night hopped up to his feet quickly grabbing  his sneakers .  As he strapped them on Amanda  asked  with  haste  and confusion in her voice ,""Amor  wait, what did I say  ?""        

  Brian tries to  maintain composure even though his hands are visibly shaking from  hypertension accelerated by anger , confusion and conflicting emotions  !     Brian  simply  tunes out  Amanda's voice      as he reaches  for his  SAT-phone , house keys,  ID, and  pistol   . Hustling down the  stairs  Amanda  gave  chase up to the front door pleading,""Are you mad at me  ?""  Then sighing , Is this about me moving to Florida   ?

Brian can feel his heart 
breaking 
as he started his SUV   
The following morning Brian reported to work  to attend to a consult with his dentist in Queens  . Amanda was the farthest thing from his mind, while it was true  he was hurting  desperately from the potential pain of losing Amanda  , Brian  remembered a rule  that all operators follow ,"" A distracted soldier is a dead soldier  ! ""  

 14: 15 Zulu  Metropolitan medical center . As Brian is walking down the hallway of the surgical recovery ward  , A mass-Casualty alert  is sounded  over the radio ! Victims  of a basement fire  are inbound  and it is  the job of the security department to assist with traffic control and transport of patients to  safe areas when possible  .

 48 hours later, Saturday afternoon 
 17:35 Zulu .  After a long day  our couple  has been away  from each other since  early this  morning and  haven't  spent much time alone , Brian  is  feeling just  a little lonely  although  he and Amanda  had spent  last night  alone  ...23:45 Zulu  last night. 
Brian comes home  from  a very  long and exhausting  tour  to find  Amanda  peacefully sleeping on the bed, trying not to disturb her  he crawls onto the bed then gently rests next to Amanda taking her hand gently and resting it on his chest.  

Amanda  can feel something new as a calm heartbeat starts to relax next to her.  ""There you are...Where have been all night,  and don't tell me you were working because I called the office  at  7:00 to  
see weather you were coming home but no one answered  ...The company said  there was an emergency at the hospital,  I  couldn't sit still..What happened amor  ?""   

Brian responds,"" I can't  chula, I'm  under  federal orders not to speak of the incident under penalty of arrest  ...in other words,  I  talk,  I go to jail  !"" The couple fall into a deep  passion forgetting the argument they had  the night  before  ...Brian, With all his strength  takes Amanda  into his arms  . Staring into her eyes he pleads, ""I  broke my promise and I don't deserve your love,  All I ask is your forgiveness. "" 19:35 Zulu Saturday evening,  again  Brian comes   home from work a little early  with just  one thing on his mind ...To be nearest the one   he cares for  . When  he crawls onto the bed Amanda stirs and smiles with her eyes closed  . Brian  simply lies next to her and gets  comfortable as he smiles  ,"" Shh you've had a long day close your eyes  ."" 

Meanwhile ,  A dream  that Brian shared with Amanda replays in his head, Brian  holds Amanda close as she  gets ready for a shower,  The water is warm as the couple steps  into the bathroom,  Brian takes a washcloth wet with soapy water and gently washes every inch  he can feel.  Gently  kissing every spot on the way  . There are some mornings that our pair just doesn't want to leave the safety of the bed and  dread the rising sun for  with it comes the challenges of a new day. 
 For Brian it means keeping the peace and restoring order . For  Amanda it means  spending time with her family back home in Brooklyn .

So what's next for our hero and his ladyfriend  :

‚Ä¢ With  Amanda  intent on leaving  will this fairytale friendship survive , will it grow  ?

‚Ä¢ Will our pair ever find what  they  seek  in thier hearts  ?

‚Ä¢ Did Amanda tell Brian the truth

Way to tidy up app drawer,"Hi there guys, I like Poco launcher and Miui but the app drawer is a mess, being unable to create folders. Yes it does have categories but an app is both in category and in the main app drawer. Do you have any tips how to tidy it up? I have to have icons on home screen because the app drawer is unusable mess for me.

I tried Nova but gestures didn't work so that's a no go for me. I also tried Mint launcher by Xiaomi but gestures didn't work there either.

At this point I'd rather be without the drawer, it's there a way to disable it?

[M4F] Giving up my rights and freedom was a small price to pay for my Big Tiddy Alien Snek GF (XCOM Inspired),"When the aliens came mankind‚Äôs unified resistance to the otherworldly menace ended not with a bang, but a whimper. Superior weapons, superior technology, and even superior numbers had gutted nearly all of the Earth‚Äôs militaries in a matter of weeks as each country fell, one by one, under alien occupation. By the time America- from sea to shining sea- was fully under their rule the aliens had swept through and conquered Africa and Asia and had started their first colonies on European soil. In the end, most governments sued for peace- submitting their citizens to the control of their new alien overlords.

‚ÄòBut why us; why Earth?‚Äô was the question of the day once the dust had finally settled. And as the aliens departed their motherships and their robots began to repair the damage to our cities- or built entirely new ones- the answer was very clear:

‚ÄòWe need to breed.‚Äô

A strange virus had swept through the galaxy, killing the males (or male equivalents) of several alien civilizations and preventing new ones from being born. Earth, long considered to be the universe‚Äôs ‚Äúnature preserve‚Äù, was the only habitable planet free of the virus. More importantly alien abductions had revealed that Earth males were not only immune to the virus- they were also sexually compatible with many alien races, requiring only a minimum amount of genetic modification before their sperm could viably fertilize alien eggs.

One year has passed since the invasion. All human males over the age of eighteen are automatically assigned an alien ‚Äúmate‚Äù that they are legally required to have children with. For some this mearly means providing their semen for artificial fertilization before finding a normal human girl (or a different alien) to settle down with. Other couples prefer more... traditional methods to procreation.

Some men got green-skinned space babes, space-elves, or shape-shifters who could be anything or anyone they wanted. Me? I was assigned to a twenty to thirty foot long cold-blooded reptile with venomous fangs, serrated teeth, and a retractable tongue meant for pulling in prey, who could also smell fear. The notification of who I was assigned to came with a detailed list of instructions on what I should do if she started sneaking into my bed and laying lengthwise next to me.

But fuck it; it wasn‚Äôt like my dating prospects were great right now and her ‚Äúvenom sacks‚Äù were huge. I indicated on some form I had to fill out that I was okay with her moving in with me and to my surprise, she accepted. She‚Äôd be arriving today with her things.

My apartment was clean, I had some extra cash for a night on the town, the cybernetic implant on the back of my neck that transmitted my location and health status to the alien government at all times was fully charged, and I had the phone number of a guy trying to sell off some chickens who lived downtown ‚Äújust in case‚Äù.

The doorbell rings. I just hope old Cupid doesn‚Äôt miss his shot.

‚Äî-

What can I say; I love the sexy slither of a lady snake. You can check out my DPP profile pinned to my userpage to get a better idea of my kinks and limits, and can also see some of my other prompts to get a better idea of what I‚Äôm into and how I am as a writer. My limits are mainly scat, gore, heavy pain and cheating/cuckolding. The kinks I‚Äôm interested in for this RP in particular include femdom, size-differences, most anything related to oral sex (including vore), being wrapped up in the coils of a hot lady snake and two beings of different species exploring each other‚Äôs bodies. Monstergirls are another one, and although I wrote this prompt around the idea of a more ‚Äúmonstrous‚Äù monstergirl a more conventional lamia is also something I‚Äôd be up for. I play on reddit‚Äôs PM system only for the most part, though if we really hit it off I might be willing to switch things over to Discord. Chat requests will be ignored unless they seem promising. Also, I‚Äôm willing to change some of the plot details of any of my ideas, and would love to hear any ideas you might have as well! I typically write 3+ paragraphs or roughly 5,000 characters on average per post, so I‚Äôm looking for literate partners who prefer fewer- but also longer- posts per day, rather than someone who prefers shorter, more frequent posts.

‚Äî-

I had a few different ideas for how we could take things in a different direction while writing the basic premise up above; I‚Äôm including them in case they‚Äôre of interest, though if they‚Äôre not I‚Äôm totally fine with sticking to the original idea.

**Double Trouble-** *There was one little problem when I was assigned my alien mate: I already had a human girlfriend. Although the new world order won‚Äôt break up existing relationships helping them repopulate the various species that fall under their control is mandatory. Now I have to keep both my girlfriends happy, or at least stop them from killing each other... Alternatively, I was assigned TWO (or more!) aliens, all of whom have elected to live with me for whatever reason. Hopefully I‚Äôll manage to survive the attentions of these lusty xenos, seeing as they haven‚Äôt had access to a man for god knows how long...*

**Long War-** *The war against the aliens didn‚Äôt end in a day, for all that they had the technological advantage- after all, they couldn‚Äôt exactly nuke us when their goal was to secure viable mates. Perhaps I live in an alien-occupied city, or maybe I‚Äôm a soldier who was captured- either way, I‚Äôll be learning the alien‚Äôs plan for humanity ahead of everyone else once I‚Äôm paired up with one of the enemy. Can love bloom among the rubble and the sounds of explosions, or will resentment lead to tragedy?*

**Alien Abduction-** *The last thing I remembered was sitting outside when the night sky suddenly lit up with this eerie green glow; the next thing I knew, I was strapped to a table and surrounded by aliens. After all, why  bother with an alien invasion when it‚Äôs so much easier to just abduct random humans? Perhaps I‚Äôm to be shipped back to their homeworld to be given as a pet or concubine to their queen, or maybe everyone on board their ship is going to have their way with me before deciding if I‚Äôm worth keeping or not- either way, I‚Äôve got a long stay ahead of me...*

**The Bachelor IN SPACE-** *A few years have passed since the alien invasion, and although things are far less dire men are still paired up with alien women. Only, without the threat of extinction lingering over everyone‚Äôs heads the aliens have decided to take some cues from Earth media, leading to one of the strangest reality TV shows yet. The contestants: several alien females, all of different races. The prize: me, the human male who they‚Äôre trying to woo/win. The game: a shared living space onboard a luxury cruiser, a series of dates on various exotic planets, and various ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù of unknown nature created for the contestants by the producers to keep things interesting. The twist: no matter who wins in the end, I‚Äôm going to be mated with each alien regardless. Aliens don‚Äôt have much of a taboo when it comes to sex, so each interaction will be streamed LIVE from the depths of space! But who will win? The space elf? The Xenomorph? The snake woman? The fifteen foot protoplasmic sphere of eyes and screaming mouths? It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs game to win or lose!*

**Titanoboa-** *Aliens truly can come in any shape or size; if you want proof, you need only look at the xeno woman that I‚Äôve been paired with. At first I thought her listed height/length was an error; it was only when I was left on the doorstep to the massive terrarium-esque structure that she called a home- along with a container of rat-like alien creatures who were each about as big as I was- that the truth finally revealed itself to me. At over a hundred feet long my alien mate was truly a giantess; and I was the mouse in the lion‚Äôs den- or the snake‚Äôs den, I should say. The size-difference alone would make things difficult enough, let alone our differing anatomies... but, well, it‚Äôs not like either of us have a choice in the matter so we might as well try and make the best of it, right?*",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdh27k/m4f_giving_up_my_rights_and_freedom_was_a_small/,Long Term RP,Alterkation,pdh27k,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdh27k/m4f_giving_up_my_rights_and_freedom_was_a_small/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdh27k/m4f_giving_up_my_rights_and_freedom_was_a_small/,0,2021-08-28
[M4F] Tired of guys who don‚Äôt arouse you mentally and think their dick is magic? Live in/around #WashingtonDC? Want to explore things safely with someone who thinks sex shouldn‚Äôt lack the vanilla aspects? Looking for a guy who enjoys cuddling and bonding as much as spanking and choking?,"I'm looking for a little/sub to be a play partner or friend with benefits to explore and keep each other company.

I'm relatively new to the area and don't really know anyone outside of a few male friends I have made through mutual interests.

My interest and participation in kink goes back well over a decade, I'm now a little over 30, and I have a decent amount of experience being a Dom/Daddy.  However, I believe there is always room to grow, learn more, and especially help others on their journey, whether they are totally new and haven't been spanked once or been a part of the community for years.

When it comes to looks, I have been told I'm very conventionally attractive.  I have a few tattoos, I'm quite tall, not overweight but also not ripped flaunting muscles, and (not to sound arrogant or cocky) but my looks have never been an issue. I have no problems meeting women, I'm just picky and at this point in my life I prefer finding someone who matches what I want right off the bat, to a larger extent, rather than using dating apps where there's no guarantee someone will be into any of this.

All I look for physically in a partner is someone who is thin/athletic/proportionate.  I don't expect you to go to the gym everyday, if you do that's fine, or have some unrealistic body-shape. But looks do matter and I have zero interest in someone who is overweight or doesn't care about their appearance and trying to look presentable on a daily basis.

Personality-wise, I do best with girls who are naturally submissive in nature and find they are happiest pleasing someone else, following directions, finding humor in the small things in life, and a nice laugh or cute voice always makes me smile. It would be great if you are passionate about something, anything really, and intelligent enough to at least engage in intellectually stimulating conversations.  

With all that being said, I like being able to teach and help someone grow as a person.  So a good attitude of ""I don't know it all and I want to learn more"" is way more appealing than ""disagreeing with me is insulting"" or ""I have it all figured out and I've done it all before.""  Because even I don't feel that way.

Ideally this would be the type of dynamic where we can hang out and play video games together, explore each other's kinks, feel comfortable enough to try new things, and go out together in public to explore the city.  I love photography and would be happy to teach you how to take better pictures, and let you use my camera.

I work full-time right now, usually 12 hour days 5 days a week, and so my time off is usually spent relaxing at my home.  I actually prefer that since I spend the week running around the office and interacting with lots of people.  I guess I would consider myself to be ambiverted but lately have been preferring indoor activities.

My kinks are pretty much all inclusive.  I will list the majority of them here, just keep in mind you don't need to be interested in all of them for us to get along or be compatible. 

Anal, bondage, spanking, nipple pinching, orgasm control (forced/denial), light degradation, light humiliation, pee, toys, exhibition, corruption, innocence, slapping, choking, crying (bleeding mascara), making you feel small, light public play (calling me sir, asking for permission), bathroom control, and a few more I won't list publicly but am happy to share privately once we open up.

Aftercare is important to me and as much as I definitely have a sadistic side, I'm naturally a caregiver and want to make sure you are happy and comfortable. 

I want to make it very clear that I am not looking for a relationship right now, although I'm not opposed to finding one over time. I just don't have the time or energy for any kind of serious emotional commitment, so please respect that boundary and only reply if you are okay with FWB.

Let's explore this city, and each other, together!  Also lots of cuddling and video games!  I've had some co-op games in my Steam library that I've been dying to play with someone.

Lastly, and most importantly, offense is taken and not given. If you find yourself unable to talk to people whom disagree with you without getting upset, whether it's about politics, religion, economics, social issues, etc.  We will not get along.  I really enjoy having conversations with people whom I don't agree with, actually prefer them over people who agree with me, because I feel you can learn a lot and make the world a better place by having those conversations with a smile and being understanding of their perspective.",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdh8tc/m4f_tired_of_guys_who_dont_arouse_you_mentally/,Chat,neoniscool_,pdh8tc,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdh8tc/m4f_tired_of_guys_who_dont_arouse_you_mentally/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdh8tc/m4f_tired_of_guys_who_dont_arouse_you_mentally/,0,2021-08-28
M4F/T From Hard Kink to the Gentler Side,"

I‚Äôm the kind of guy who has always been into the heavier side of BDSM, no matter which end of the flogger I‚Äôm on. There is nothing I love more that tying someone up and hearing the noises they make as I work my way through my paddle and flogger collection. Likewise, I love to be roughed up by a strong woman, pushed around, called dirty and demeaning things, made to beg, and plead as she does whatever it is she wants with me. I‚Äôve tried lots of things in my long kink career. What I have had next to no experience with is a gentle hand.

I would love to meet someone who wants to take someone and show them the benefits that only a gentle domme can provide. Someone encouraging, rather than demeaning. Someone who will tie me up for the purpose of teasing with gentle touches, possibly mixed with light pain, rather than someone who just wants to beat me black and blue. Someone who will make love while pegging, rather than something closer to a hate-fuck. Hopefully you get what I mean. I also like the idea of someone in the middle: gentle and encouraging, but not afraid to hurt you. I once saw this type described as ‚ÄúAbusive Mommy‚Äù and I thought it was a perfect descriptor (although I won‚Äôt call you mommy).

There doesn‚Äôt need to be a scenario or anything we need to play out, it could just be two kinky people exploring each other. I am also just up for an exchange of ideas and conversation. However, if you would like to play out a scene here are a few ideas:

-We all have that friend that likes to play matchmaker, and she just thought we would be *perfect* together since we are both kinky. What she didn‚Äôt know is that we have completely different play styles.

-We meet at a public kink event and hit it off right away. We get along so well we end up just hanging out all afternoon/evening and decide to bring it home. However, during negotiations, we realise that we play on different ends of the spectrum. We decide to give it a go anyway and see what happens.

-I posted something similar to this post on a kinky dating site and you were intrigued, deciding that I sounded like a fun new project for you, so you message me.

Just a few ideas to get us started! I am open to pretty much anything else.

As for kinks, [here is my kinklist]( https://i.imgur.com/pmOwyRt.png) for those who are into it. Basically, as long as it doesn‚Äôt involve scat, diapers, vomit, smoking, animals, underage, mutilation, gore, snuff, tickling and being called Daddy/calling you Mommy I am good to go. I am pretty open, just ask! 

I look forward to seeing who is out there and getting to know some new, sexy people. Please, **send me a DM first**, as chat requests tend to get ignored/missed. I am going to be on and off tonight, so may be slow to reply, but I will reply to most!",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdggu9/m4ft_from_hard_kink_to_the_gentler_side/,RP,MyKinkyTA,pdggu9,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdggu9/m4ft_from_hard_kink_to_the_gentler_side/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdggu9/m4ft_from_hard_kink_to_the_gentler_side/,0,2021-08-28

"F4M - Giving new meaning to the phrase ""Home Invasion""","I woke up hornier than hell, still gasping from the hot fantasy that had taken over my mind all night long. 

Quickly pushing the blankets off my sweaty skin, I roll out of bed, simultaneously desperate to cum and yearning for a shower. 

The shower switched on right before I stumbled inside and for a second, I balked in confusion. 

Then I remembered: The company I'd been sent out to assess had put me up in one of those fancy ""smart home"" Airbnb's.

A smirk graced my lips. They were clearly trying to impress me with how much they could spend, but little did they know--I would only be impressed by their actual tech. If it wasn't amazing, there was no way I'd recommend a merger. 

*Still, might as well enjoy!* I thought, stepping inside. For a few seconds I just basked under the streams of water. Then, I let the memory of the dream slowly wash over me.

... hands sliding down my back and over my thighs... 

...making my legs spread apart...

...a tongue lapping gently at my clit... 

My whimper echoed off the glass as my fingers slid between my thighs... 

But just before I could spread myself open, something cold snaked around my wrists and ankles and closed tight! 

I barely had time to shriek as I was yanked backwards and up into the air, my back pressed hard against the icy cold tiles, arms pulled high above my head, and ankles strapped to the wall, making my knees dig into my shoulders.

""St--! Stop!"" I tried to scream, only to squeal in shock and pleasure as one of the streams from above turned into a hard jet of water aimed right at my clit. 

I thrashed against the wall hard as I could, incredibly terrified and yet *so turned on*. 

To my shame and dismay, it only took a few seconds of sustained pressure for my climax to overtake me and I cried out as my pussy pulsed and spasmed under the powerful jet that never relented. 

""Pl-please, pleeease stop,"" I begged the shower desperately. But either it didn't hear me or it didn't care, for even more hard jets of water appeared in midair and headed straight for me. 

I gasped in pleasure as they hit the backs of my knees, my back arching up off the wall. 

Then I kept gasping, breathlessly, overwhelmed and dizzy, as they roved down between my legs like fingers raking down my thighs. I screamed when they reached my pussy, pounding into my folds, then thrashed in panic as they suddenly changed direction--literally *moved along the walls of the shower!*--so that they could get the perfect angle to push my lips aside and pound into my pussy. 

My eyes rolled. The pleasure was so intense. I felt myself cumming again and again against my will, the hot jets surging all over my pussy like tentacles, opening me up inch by inch as more and more joined the fray. Through squinted eyes I saw little panels in the walls at my sides open, and tiny robotic arms extended. 

They had pincers on the end that bit down on my pussy lips, clamping them hard and pulling them away until my hole was perfectly bared. 

And then... 

Out of the far side of the shower I saw a long, sleek rod emerge. It wasnt like any dildo I'd ever seen, even in the wildest pornos I'd watched. It was slim and covered in tiny threads of wire and electrodes as if... it was more a scanning tool used to test and record findings... than a mere toy. 

I instantly felt more terrified than ever. 

""Help!"" I shouted as loud as I could. ""Please help me--!"" 

A metal muzzle was slapped across my mouth and my head was wrenched back to the wall. I couldn't see what was going on between my legs any more, could only feel as the water kept up is constant stream and the clamps dug into my even tighter. 

I could see the rod coming closer, though... closer and closer until it was out of sight, hidden by my own trembling breasts. 

I braced myself for the feel of it forcing its way inside me, squeezing my eyes tightly shut--

""Good morning, Ms. Cruz!"" 

My eyes snapped open wide at the sound of the voice. It was the same voice I'd heard on the phone yesterday, the voice of the CEO I was supposed to be meeting with this week! 

A video of you appeared on the far side of the shower, right above the panel that the shaft extended from, and you were looking right at me! 

I blushed bright red--embarrassed, furious, confused--and tried to hide away. Suddenly, hot water was splashing across my face, into my eyes, ears and nose, making sputter for breath. 

""Ah, ah, ah... I'm gonna need you to stay here, fully focused and... observant of our tech. After all, that's what you're here for, right?"" you said, smirking. 

I watched in horror as your hands did something beneath the edge of the screen and the rod started moving forward again. In a second, it was against me, its tip feeling so huge as it pressed against my exposed little entrance...

I whimpered into the gag brokenly, begging you to not do this to me. 

You grinned back and with a sudden shove, it forced me open. 

I squealed at the tight fit, my muscles clamping so hard around its head that it almost hurt. 

""Mmmm, excellent! You're already giving some amazing readings. Are you...a virgin, by any chance? According to this data, you're tighter than any other tester we've used..."" 

I could barely understand what you were saying let alone answer. The rod pushed in deeper, slowly opening me up in ways no one else ever had, and I could only gasp and whimper as I felt my walls stretched wide apart... 

And all the while, every time my eyes fluttered open, I saw your grinning face... 

""Oh yes... you're perfect... I don't think we've ever seen this kind of *resistance*... you're going to have a *very* productive week with us"" I heard, only catching snippets as you made the toy go even deeper. 

""Let's try..."" and suddenly there was a pulse inside me, some kind of hard vibration that made my whole body spasm. 

You laughed in delight, and did it again, much to my dismay. I thrashed in the bonds, shaking my head desperately as the pulses came faster and faster, moving deeper and deeper inside me until suddenly they hit something that made me lurch up and scream, pussy clamping down hard as my whole body exploded in pleasure.

First love visits my dreamland often but why?,"Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling like I really have been letting this get in my thoughts often &amp; I can‚Äôt shake it. I want to know why. 

I dream of my first boyfriend constantly. We dated in 8th and 9th grade and we‚Äôre friends/kept in touch ever since. Last time I‚Äôve physically seen him was about 10 yrs ago, our first year at university. We would grab lunch or hang out during breaks we had but it was never anything but that, we were long time friends. 
I would say I‚Äôve always dreamt about him. The first significant dream I had of him not long after (2-4 days) I found out his partner had given birth to their first kid. I hadn‚Äôt known any information before then. 
We he appears in my dreams it‚Äôs very vivid &amp; they are some of the dreams I can remember the most. It‚Äôs always a longing romantic dream. Similar to rom coms so I think it‚Äôs funny. 
In a reoccurring dream I have of him we always first see each other at Target &amp; are so happy to see one another. It doesn‚Äôt go much past that part but the emotions &amp; energy feel really real. Recently, I found out he lives not to far from me &amp; there‚Äôs a Target in between our homes. Again, I had no prior knowledge he lived in this area &amp; we just recently bought a home here. 
It‚Äôs just all too weird. Not in a bad way but odd.

I get a lot of nightmares but this one has been the worst so far. Repressed memory maybe? Advice would be appreciated.,"So i have borderline personality disorder and i see someone every week to talk about things (this is a key part of the dream and ill refer to this person as lily) As far as i know i have no significant trauma but i had this nightmare where a weird dream version of lily kept dragging me into a room at the back of this fancy estate home. The house would flick between that and a psychiatric hospital.

Lily kept trying to get me to remember something but i was resisting it hard (i think it was lucid dreaming, i didn‚Äôt know it was a dream but i was going against what my brain wanted me to dream of). I was desperately looking for a person who i was close to thats no longer in my life but they weren‚Äôt there. Whats interesting is i haven‚Äôt lucid dreamed in a very long time its been years.

When i was in the room like i said lily was trying to force me to remember something and told me theres no way out of the room but i kept repeating i make my own reality and i created like a path/trail through a field out of the room that i started running down. This took a lot of mental energy to do/create. It felt like i was really resisting this nightmare.

I got caught and this big guy picked me up and started breaking my bones in an effort to try to get me to go back to the room but i was lucid dreaming again and made it not hurt. Eventually i ended up talking to a normal version of lily i was telling her whats happening and i kept flicking between there and the room with the other version of her.

I told the nice version that the other one wants me to remember something and that its something horrible. The bad version managed to break through slightly, she said something happened last year, i then started having all these flashes of memory &amp; a horrible horrible mental pain feeling there was screaming too and then i woke up.

Sorry this is a bit long &amp; i hope this makes sense but do you think its just a silly nightmare or something more like a repressed memory? The way that i haven‚Äôt lucid dreamed in so long, the way i was resisting so hard and the fact that i woke up as soon as i started remembering makes me think its something more like i said before because of my mental health i have a lot of nightmares but this one is not like anything I‚Äôve ever had before.",Dreams,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/pdkxaj/i_get_a_lot_of_nightmares_but_this_one_has_been/,Nightmare,apricity02,pdkxaj,/r/Dreams/comments/pdkxaj/i_get_a_lot_of_nightmares_but_this_one_has_been/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/pdkxaj/i_get_a_lot_of_nightmares_but_this_one_has_been/,0,2021-08-29
[20F] most intense oral ever with best friends dad...,"So without going too much into the backstory of how this happened, I was going to my friends place to drop something off for her/see her, but due to a mix up she wasn't home. Her (not married) dad was home alone though and in fact was working out just before/while I got there and was in his gym clothes. We have known each other for a while but no more than like as my best friends dad, you know what I mean... But he was nice enough to have me come in and stuff even though his daughter wasn't home, we chatted for a bit, he offered me a drink...  
I'm not sure if it was how I was looking at his stomach/chest/arms, while he had no shirt on and was toweling sweat off, or how I was looking at him as he put a workout shirt on while we were talking, but he must have picked up something because the sort of tone of the chat changed a bit and he started telling me he noticed how cute I am and that I was a lookalike for a certain celeb that he must have heard me and his daughter joke about. But then when he was brushing my cheek with his hand softly and touching my arm, it must have been pretty obvious by how I was looking at him that I was into him and thought he was hot.  


After a bit, he very directly put his fingers under my chin and raised my head up a little to kiss me, then I felt totally swept up in the moment and let him kiss me, before feeling him sort of guide me down/push me down before him in front of him, on my knees, and he took his cock out, and it was already hard and throbbing touching my lips... Thing get a little uh, graphic, from here lol.   
After letting it sit on my lips and cheek and nose, and kissing it, he started to thrust himself in my mouth and then hold my head and start to really thrust, no matter how much spit and drool there was he kept going. When I would gag he would say something reassuring and keep going, but the way he was breathing and moaning and everything made me feel like this was so amazing. Soon I was retching up basically down myself, like so much spit, it got really messy, but he really loved it, he was telling me how cute I was and how hot it was whenever I gagged or drooled and retched up. It was obviously a little... uncomfortable, choking and gagging like that, but at the same time so amazing. He even paused as my eyes were tearing up, and asked if it was too much. When he would hold my head / hair firmly and try to push himself all in my mouth and hot the back of my throat, I could feel my stomach clench and my gag reflex ""tense up"" as I choked and then made a mess out of my mouth and even my nose, and then he was so clearly turned on by it I felt amazing...  


It felt like it went for a really long time but it probably was only 5-10 mins really, but then when he finished he held my hair and kept my head still there as he finished all over my face, my eyes and nose was all scrunched up and  he was really loud, like moaning and stuff but louder, as his cum just kept hitting my face and like hanging off it.. he told me I looked really hot when he was finished.  
I had to clean up my face after but he was trying to get me to stay like that, like he kept saying wait not yet, haha but then I was worried someone was going to come in or something. So  I washed my face and stuff but my top was totally drenched in my spit and stuff, and I had to walk home. He gave me one of his jumpers to put over my top and drove me back quickly, both of us texting his daughter separately as if nothing happened while he did...  


I've seen him again after this time now too, it is so hot but so, so bad of me, I can't imagine what it would be like if my best friend found out...",SluttyConfessions,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/pdl1fd/20f_most_intense_oral_ever_with_best_friends_dad/,,leftisbestred,pdl1fd,/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/pdl1fd/20f_most_intense_oral_ever_with_best_friends_dad/,https://www.reddit.com/r/SluttyConfessions/comments/pdl1fd/20f_most_intense_oral_ever_with_best_friends_dad/,0,2021-08-29

I re-enact paranormal experiences,"  

I have a unique job. I re-enact people‚Äôs paranormal experiences. Sounds off the wall when you hear it like that, but it‚Äôll make sense as I explain further. Most people that have watched a touch of basic cable in the last 20 years are familiar with the ‚ÄúMy paranormal story, or haunted experience,‚Äù type of programming. These are usually found on your travel type channels, discovery, ID, etc. Every show has a real simple concept. Person that had ‚Äúreal,‚Äù paranormal experience discusses what happened, an actor (like me,) re-enacts what happened. Couldn‚Äôt be simpler than that right? This has been the cash cow of the paranormal programming world probably since about the year 2000.

I started my career as a commercial actor, had some small roles on tv and announcing, reading ads, stuff like that. I‚Äôve been fortunate to make a career out of finding a niche in the paranormal re-enactment world. Have you seen a commercial actor that you recognize from multiple advertisements and wonder why they are used so frequently? It‚Äôs usually because they have some kind of look that‚Äôs pleasing, or a solid voice if it requires speaking lines. I believe my success is based on the same idea.

I‚Äôll try my best to paint you a small, simple picture of myself. I‚Äôm a mid 30‚Äôs white male. I‚Äôm average height. I‚Äôm slightly overweight. I have dark hair and dark eyes. I can play the ‚Äúperson involved,‚Äù (the P.I. is what call the real person whose paranormal experience we are taping for the day. I know ‚ÄúPerson involved,‚Äù sounds like they are an armed robbery suspect or something, but it‚Äôs just easy on paper, and when we need to identify the persons story we are doing for the day. I can also play the husband, brother, uncle, neighbor, and so on. 

If you‚Äôve watched these type of shows before, it‚Äôs a badly kept secret that the actors barely resemble the real people telling the story. In the producers defense they do really try their best. But as the years went by and the popularity rose for paranormal re-enactment shows, pop culture prevailed and we kind of have a wink at the audience picking some of the actors to re-enact the persons involved. Most people comment things like ‚Äúoh come on, the real person talking about their experience is, sorry don‚Äôt mean to be mean but they‚Äôre like 300 pounds, and the actor portraying them is like a model.‚Äù We get that all the time. It‚Äôs Tv baby, that‚Äôs as simple as I can put it for everyone. You don‚Äôt tune in to watch ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù people all the time. 

That‚Äôs kind of where I come in funny enough. Maybe it was by accident, maybe the producers did it on purpose. Because I‚Äôm so vanilla, I played mostly opposite that role. Whether the P.I (person involved,) was slim or heavy, I just seemed to fit the part. I‚Äôm nothing special, all of us re-enactors are secondary to the story. People in the business liked me though. Call it a non-threatening demeanor or look, the jury is still out. It‚Äôs allowed me to work and provide for myself, so I don‚Äôt mind either way.

That‚Äôs enough for my intro. What follows is possibly my last re-enactment. Maybe my last.. anything.

8 A.M. I pick up some Kellogg‚Äôs cereal and a stale bagel. Hopefully there is some 2% milk left in the fridge near catering. Hell, I‚Äôll take whole right now. This isn‚Äôt a Hollywood studio on the back lot of the Paramount or Warner Bros studio. We film at a small sound stage in a small town in Georgia, about 30 minutes south of Atlanta. I live close by so it‚Äôs convenient for me. I spoke with ‚ÄúTommy D,‚Äù briefly. We went over blocking and what my role entailed today. It‚Äôs always pretty non-thinking as I never have any speaking lines. Makes it easy. Tommy D handles most of the paranormal re-enactment shows on TV today. His claim to fame is making the ‚Äúlove after lockup,‚Äù shows popular. He is very self-aware. Doesn‚Äôt take himself too seriously. It may seem silly to some, what he does, but he‚Äôs passionate and good at it. He‚Äôs always had a good energy about him.

From what I‚Äôve read on this particular script it‚Äôs a run of the mill format. PI hears noises, sees things that seemingly are not there, etc. Pictures fly off the wall and there is a general unease at what they are seeing. The source always comes from the basement. They find an evil totem or something, and possession usually Takes over someone in the house. Same old story. I don‚Äôt judge the PI‚Äôs experience. I‚Äôve never had a paranormal incident in my life but I‚Äôm open minded. I‚Äôve seen and done so many of these that I have no reason to not believe these folks. 

After doing some rehearsals and feeling confident enough to tape, I try to find the PI. It‚Äôs always best to pick the brain of the man or woman that this happened to. I asked one of the production assistants where they were, and they pointed him out. I immediately locked eyes with him. He was staring right at me, like he was watching me the entire time. I felt an odd rush of emotions. Scared, odd, off-putting. Shaking those feelings, I took one step toward him, and he was ushered off into one of the other sound stages. I guess it was time for him to tape his interview portion. I just wanted to speak to him for a moment, get some deeper insight into what he went through. I was playing him after all, the star of the show as it were.

I taped most of the episode in a few hours. Might be some minor re-shoots but since I‚Äôm so close they know it won‚Äôt be an issue. One of the other great things about living so close. All I had to do was react to some items flying off the walls, pretending to see shadows and unknown entities from the corner of my eye. I had a quick basement scene where I picked up a straw stick figure like thing from the ground. Always interested to see the show when it airs live on television. Like I said I usually try to speak to the PI to get the ‚Äútrue story,‚Äù so I have a better understanding from them. Doesn‚Äôt always happen, like this time, but I tried.

Pulling up to my modest suburban home, I decided to park on the street so I could clean my garage out later in the night. As soon as I shut my door, I saw what looked like a note pasted to my front door. I wasn‚Äôt expecting any deliveries. Getting closer, my heart drops. From more than 10 feet away I see two clear dark letters on the face of the white paper. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sorry.‚Äù The words looked like they were scribbled by a madman. When I got closer, in a daze, I inspected the paper. It wasn‚Äôt just one piece of paper. It was a folded little sheet of note paper. Shakily opening the note, I saw a few sentences scribbled out:

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want this to happen this way, but I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I saw an opportunity and I took it. May God bless your soul.‚Äù

After reading that I was surprisingly at ease. Just a dumb prank by some kids in the neighborhood. It‚Äôs October, and I figured it was just part of the Halloween spooky season to make mischief. No harm, no foul.

That night felt like a haze. I had a nightmare that I saw shadows, heard devilish noises, and saw red eyes staring at me from inside my bedroom. When I awoke, I tried my best to shake the feeling that something nefarious was happening. I had a commercial shoot today, but called the producer, saying I had virus-like symptoms. Didn‚Äôt want to alarm them so I said I‚Äôd take a test and update them later in the day. I just wanted to wrap up in a blanket and watch some mind-numbing internet videos.  

Jolting awake, seeing that I‚Äôve been asleep for the better part of the day, I was kind of bummed out that it‚Äôs dark outside and lost an entire day. I didn‚Äôt know how tired I was. I texted one of the producers of the commercial I was supposed to be at today that I was virus free, even though I never had any sickness, or took any test, and would be more than willing to work with them again. All I wanted was to make a hot cup of coffee and take a shower.

I never got that coffee.  As soon as I started the pot, I felt like something was wrong. I slowly pulled my favorite coffee cup from the cupboard and placed it close to the coffee maker. Turning my back for a moment, I heard a thundering crash. Whipping my body around, I can see my favorite cup is destroyed in the corner of my living room. The force and distance my cup endured is just.. I can‚Äôt explain it. I stared at the broken cup while a whoosing sound blows by my right ear. What the.. what the hell is happening? I‚Äôm feeling out of my mind. At this time I see the note in the counter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sorry.‚Äù

What I‚Äôve been going through is almost exactly what I just re-enacted on that last paranormal experience show. I‚Äôm in for another sleepless night. If I make it one more night I have some people to talk to.

Thankfully nothing happened during the night. I needed to get in contact with the person involved in that last re-enactment. I made a couple calls and texts to the production assistants I have in my phone. No responses. I even reached out to Tommy D. Nothing. I decided to drive to the soundstage. My confusion was immersible when I arrived. Everything was gone. Not possible. This little studio has been around for almost a decade. It wouldn‚Äôt just disappear overnight, what the hell is happening.

Pulling up back at home, feeling defeated, I have a sick feeling that hasn‚Äôt quite left me the past couple days. I just want to lay down upstairs in my bed. Walking up the stairs I‚Äôm frozen by a black mass with what appears to be horns protruding above an evil looking face. Blinking quickly, the anomaly disappears. I cautiously slid into bed, pulling the covers over my entire body. 

In an instant I woke up, cold sweat, head on fire. The blazing red numbers on my bed-side clock displayed the time of 3 am. Not a good sign. Without thinking I made my way downstairs, like I was guided by an invisible force. Picture frames fly off the walls as I make my way into the basement. At the foot of the stairs, I see a figure wrapped in straw on the ground. I fall to my knees forcefully, expelling what feels like every bit of liquid from my body. Looking through tear-soaked eyes, I try to focus on this evil totem in front of my face. Tendrils cloud my vision, attaching themselves onto my hands and arms.

Looking toward a closet door, I see red light emanating from beyond it. There‚Äôs a small white piece of paper posted on it. I can see the two words displaying itself to me: ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù",LighthouseHorror,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LighthouseHorror/comments/pdllhm/i_reenact_paranormal_experiences/,,leoofalexandria,pdllhm,/r/LighthouseHorror/comments/pdllhm/i_reenact_paranormal_experiences/,https://www.reddit.com/r/LighthouseHorror/comments/pdllhm/i_reenact_paranormal_experiences/,0,2021-08-29
Working Overtime -- Hooligan Issue #14," 

The crew was gathered around the forklift in a far corner of the yard. They were all sitting around, waiting for the federal agents to finish their inspection of the container.

After the first ones were discovered nearly two weeks ago, the feds had a team stationed around the clock in case any other suspicious shipments turned up. Whenever something was flagged on a shipping manifest, the agents would tape it off and force whichever crew they had nearby to stay and deal with the container once they were done with the inspection.

Today was Drew's lucky day. His crew had been an hour away from the end of their shifts when this container was flagged. That was two hours ago. Since then, they had pulled out whatever they were told to do and then were forced to sit and wait for the rest of the hour and forty minutes.

Dan kept telling Drew and Glenn that the overtime was going to be worth staying the extra time, but neither were sure if he even believed what he was saying.

Drew‚Äôs side business had been relatively quiet since taking down the container. He had broken up a mugging a couple of nights ago, but apparently the threat of a vigilante had kept most people indoors.

‚ÄúYou know?‚Äù Glenn finally broke the silence. ‚ÄúI still think it‚Äôs pretty cool that there‚Äôs a vigilante running around and fighting crime, but it was kind of a dick move to make us do all of this extra work.‚Äù

Dan and Drew laughed.

‚ÄúYeah, if I ever see him, remind me to kick his ass,‚Äù Dan said sarcastically.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôll thank him next time I see him,‚Äù Drew cut in. ‚ÄúThanks to this overtime, maybe I can afford a mattress for my apartment.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus, dude. You‚Äôre still sleeping on the floor?‚Äù Dan asked, getting down from the forklift.

‚ÄúLast paycheck had to go to utilities.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does your girlfriend think of that?‚Äù Glenn teased.

‚ÄúTwo dates. Not my girlfriend. Luckily, it hasn‚Äôt come up yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúPffft. We've got a gentleman over here,‚Äù Dan added, looking towards the agents.

Drew and Suzette had only been on a couple of dates after that first night. They were still far away from being an official couple. Hopefully by the time they were, Drew would have a bed. Well, hopefully he would have other furniture too, but he would be satisfied with a bed.

One of the agents started walking towards them. Drew was hopeful that this meant they would be out of there soon.

‚ÄúJust another ten minutes guys,‚Äù The agent said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre almost done.‚Äù

Drew, Dan and Glenn all smiled and nodded, but they knew that they were going to be there at least another half an hour.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drew was sitting in a crowded metro car, beginning to wonder where the gang that he had busted two weeks ago had gone. They surely weren‚Äôt using the docks anymore (or at least, weren't coming to the docks anymore). He obviously had no way of tracking them, but he began to wonder if he had busted them too soon. It probably would have helped to wait and see where they took everything. Then again, that wasn't the part of the job that Drew cared about.

The train pulled into a stop. As some of the passengers shuffled off and on the train, Drew took a glance from the elevated platform down to the neighborhood below.

Suddenly, he noticed a car parked in front of what looked like a warehouse that was almost exactly like the one that he had seen the other night. Then, as he was watching, he saw a man in a suit step outside of the warehouse to smoke a cigarette.

Drew couldn‚Äôt believe it.

Suddenly, the doors of the train closed. He took a glance at the station name, and wrote it down in a note on his phone. 

He came back around nine. It didn‚Äôt take much time to find the building again. This time, there were several other cars parked outside. Drew knew something had to be up.

He walked by the front of the building, trying to remain as inconspicuous as possible. As he walked by he tried to get an idea of what was going on inside the building, but the walls were so thick that he could only manage to get a dull buzz even with his powers.

There were plenty of windows that he could look in though. He just had to find a way to be able to see inside of them. That is, if they hadn‚Äôt blocked them out.

Drew looked around and saw a building next door with a construction scaffold on the front of it. It looked like that was going to be his best way up. He scampered up to the roof and tried to see what he could see inside the building.

From what he could see, they had blacked out the windows. Drew wasn‚Äôt going to be able to see anything, but maybe this would work in his favor.

Drew took a few steps back and jumped across to the roof of the warehouse. After looking around to make sure there was no way that they could access the roof, he walked across the roof and crouched down near the windows. He started to tune in to see what he could hear.

At first he could only manage to pick up the sounds of forklifts and clangs of moving boxes around but as he started to listen closer, he managed to pick up a few conversations.

‚ÄúDanny, be careful with that,‚Äù A voice with an Irish sounding accent called out. ‚ÄúIf it breaks, your ‚Äòead will be next!‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on! This needs to be out tonight!‚Äù Another voice shouted.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you think! We pay you to get this shit out the door, not to think about it! Now get that shit out of ‚Äòere and you‚Äôll be paid when you‚Äôre done!‚Äù

Drew heard a garage door open and watched a white van from a construction company roll out and go onto the streets. After watching the van turn down a corner, Drew turned his attention back inside.

There was still plenty of activity going on inside. Drew started to try and come up with some kind of plan. He knew that this would be a good opportunity to try and see where they operated, but Drew wasn‚Äôt sure what he would do with that information anyway.

Still, it probably wouldn‚Äôt hurt to tail one of the vans to see where they were going. It could at least lead to more information later.

Drew waited for the next van to leave. Soon enough, the garage door soon opened and another van turned the opposite direction of the first. Drew kept pace by jumping from rooftop to rooftop, and took a rest whenever the van stopped at one of its locations.  Drew kept a safe distance behind, but made sure that he wasn‚Äôt going to lose sight of the van.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Occasionally it made a brief stop and just like a delivery driver, one man would get out of the passenger seat and take a package up to a house. It stopped at a few apartment buildings and someone walked out and hopped in the van to grab their order. It stopped at a few bars, it stopped at a few different unsuspecting businesses, and even pulled in a few garages.

Once it got back in a more residential neighborhood again, Drew started to get worried that he was going to run out of rooftops to hop between. The car pulled down a long driveway to a housing project. Drew knew that there was no way that he could manage to trail it, he simply was going to have to hope that it came back out the same way.

He took a break on top of a nearby business and tried to keep an eye out for the van leaving again. He tried using his abilities to listen for a car moving, but there was simply too much traffic between him and the projects to be able to distinguish it. But Drew had another problem. This was boring.

He'd been following this car and what was he even going to do with all of this information? Was he going to go attack the people at all of these locations? He became very keenly aware that he had never taken down the addresses of any of these places. Drew very suddenly became aware that this whole night was going to be a failure if he didn't catch these guys while they still had stuff in their trunk.

The situation was starting to turn in Drew‚Äôs mind. He was starting to get restless on the roof across from the housing projects while who knew what they were doing inside. He started listening for the sound of the car again, but then something else caught his attention.

‚ÄúIsa!‚Äù Drew heard a female voice somewhere down the street. ‚ÄúStay close to me!‚Äù

Drew looked down the street and saw a young woman walking with a young girl. What Drew assumed was the mother was carrying a bunch of grocery bags and what he presumed to be her daughter even had a hold of one. It was at least eleven p.m. What were they doing?

Drew tried to focus back on the search for the car, but his attention kept turning back to the young mother and her daughter.

‚ÄúMommy, my shoe‚Äôs untied!‚Äù The young girl said to her mother.

‚ÄúAgain?‚Äù The mother sighed and whispered some words under her breath.

Drew chuckled to himself. The mother sat her bags down on the ground as she crouched over to tie her daughter‚Äôs shoe. Drew turned back to the housing project when he thought he heard a car engine start, but then he heard the little girl scream.

Drew whirled around back down the street as he saw a large man seemingly overpowering the mother as her daughter screamed for help. Drew stopped caring about the car.

He immediately sprung from the roof of the business to the house next door. He bounded from one to the next trying to get closer to the struggle. He couldn‚Äôt make out what exactly was happening, but he knew he had to be the one to do something.

He sprinted from roof to roof and launched himself towards the struggle off the last house in the row. As he did so, the street suddenly fell silent. Drew was right on course.

As the sound returned, the gasps of the little girl got the attention of the attacker who looked up just in time to see Drew flying towards him.

Drew tackled him to the pavement. Drew‚Äôs shoulder made hard contact with the ground and a bolt of pain shot through his body as he rolled off the attacker. The attacker was apparently in just as much, if not in more pain as he rolled the other direction.

The mother scrambled to her feet over to her awestruck daughter and quickly scooped her up in her arms. Then she turned around to watch what was happening.

Drew rolled on his side and clutched at his injured shoulder. He looked over and saw the attacker starting to get back up so Drew kicked his leg out from underneath him. Drew tried to roll over on his bad shoulder only to feel a sudden bolt of pain that knocked him flat on the ground again.

The man tried to get up again so Drew reached out and grabbed him by his back leg and tripped him again. The attacker kicked Drew in the mouth, stunning him. Drew somehow maintained his grip and recovered just in time to avoid another kick to the face.

Now Drew was pissed off. The attacker started to try and insult him, but Drew made a quick motion and there was an audible snap from the attacker‚Äôs ankle. Drew smirked as the man started to scream and he knocked him out. Drew took a deep breath before standing up.

‚ÄúWow!‚Äù The little girl said behind him.

Drew spun around and saw the mother shielding her from him.

‚ÄúThat was so cool!‚Äù The little girl said from behind her mother trying to get another glance at Drew.

‚ÄúWa-what do you want?‚Äù The mother struggled to ask.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm the good guy here,‚Äù Drew tried to reassure her, while fishing in his pockets for the zip ties.

Drew looked down to see the pack of zip ties had apparently fallen out during the scuffle.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to hurt you.‚Äù

Drew reached down to pick up the bag when he suddenly was hit in the arm by something. Drew looked over to see that the mother had thrown her purse at him. Drew looked over at the mother, still clearly terrified of him.

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù The mother pleaded. ‚ÄúJust take it and don‚Äôt hurt her.‚Äù

Drew moved the zip ties to one hand and picked up the purse. He tried to walk over to the woman to give her purse back, but the woman backed away from him. Drew sighed in a little bit of frustration.

‚ÄúI am not going to hurt either of you. I was trying to stop him--‚Äù Drew pointed at the attacker ‚Äú--from hurting you. I don‚Äôt want your purse, I want to help you.‚Äù

The little girl pushed her way around her mother.

‚ÄúAre you a superhero?‚Äù The little girl said.

Drew smiled.

‚ÄúYeah. I guess I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow.‚Äù

The girl‚Äôs mother quickly pushed her daughter behind her again, and Drew understood that she wasn‚Äôt going to trust him. So he dropped the purse by his feet and quickly turned back to the assailant.

The woman tried to keep her distance as Drew tied up the man that had just attacked her. It took a little bit of time considering that every movement sent another wave of pain through his body. He turned around to see the woman still staring at him.

‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôm gonna get out of here,‚Äù Drew said, holding his hands out to make sure that the woman could get the feeling that he wasn‚Äôt intimidating. ‚ÄúIf you want to call the police to get this guy, that‚Äôs up to you.‚Äù

Drew waited to see if she was going to respond. When it was clear she wasn‚Äôt, Drew stuck his hands in his pockets. Suddenly, he could hear sirens somewhere down the street.

‚ÄúAlright, maybe someone called them for you. I‚Äôm gonna take off now. Have a nice night.‚Äù

With that Drew took off running in the opposite direction of the woman and jumped up on the roof where he had first spotted the two of them. He watched to make sure that the police were indeed coming to help her. Once the police showed up and started to calm her down, Drew took that as his cue to leave.

He knew that he had to have lost the car, but maybe if he went back to the warehouse he would be able to tail another one.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once he arrived back at the warehouse, all of the cars that had been there before had completely cleared out. Drew climbed to the roof and tried to see if he could hear anything inside, but it was completely silent.

Drew cursed his luck and thought about what he was going to do next. He leaned on one of the windows, and much to his surprise the top swung inwards while the bottom hit him in the shin.

It was unlocked.

Drew peered in, and it was very clear that there was no one in there. He looked around the inside to make sure that there would be a way for him to get back out if he went in this way and decided to take a look.

He attempted to lower himself into the building, but as he started hanging from the ledge, the pain shot through his arm again and he just barely managed to land on his feet before falling on his back. He gingerly stood up trying not to move his shoulder too much.

Drew looked around and he didn‚Äôt see much evidence that the warehouse had even been in use hours earlier. Whatever they had been moving was clearly long gone. The only reason Drew knew that the warehouse was still in use was that he had heard the activity earlier that night.

Drew couldn‚Äôt believe that anyone could be this meticulous in clearing evidence. He almost wondered if he hadn‚Äôt gone to the wrong warehouse.

‚ÄúYeah, that would be just my luck,‚Äù Drew thought to himself.

Drew made his way to the offices towards the back. He went through the drawers to see if there was anything in there. But alas, there wasn‚Äôt anything else there either. This was the most thorough cleaning operation Drew had ever seen.

As Drew sat down on one of the desks in the office, he looked at a clock on the wall. It was 1:30. Drew had been at this for hours and had accomplished relatively nothing. Drew figured he might as well turn in for the night. As he walked back towards the window that he used to get in, something caught his attention.

Drew got closer and realized it was an overturned clipboard. Drew walked over, confused about how he had missed it the first time. He picked it up and as he did so, a pink piece of paper fell on the ground. Drew picked it up.

It was a receipt for some kind of shipping contract. At first Drew didn‚Äôt think too much of it, but then he realized that the names on the contracts were just fronts for whoever was behind whatever was going on.

Drew stashed the receipt in his pocket and started to look for a way back out.

By the time he made it back home it was already three in the morning and Drew‚Äôs shoulder was absolutely killing him. He struggled taking off his sweatshirt and his shirt to reveal a dark bruise running on his shoulder and upper arm.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to work on my landings, apparently.‚Äù Drew said to himself.

He tried lifting his arm above his head and managed to do so, albeit with a tremendous amount of pain, but him being able to lift it probably meant that it wasn‚Äôt a broken bone. Of course, that did nothing to soothe the pain right now but it at least meant that it wouldn‚Äôt last nearly as long.

By the time that Drew crawled into ‚Äúbed‚Äù it was nearly three a.m. By the time four o‚Äôclock rolled around, he knew his shoulder wasn‚Äôt going to let him get any sleep.  He knew he was going to have a miserable time at work tomorrow.",QXCooperative,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/QXCooperative/comments/pdlbxw/working_overtime_hooligan_issue_14/,Hooligan,Jakefromst_farm,pdlbxw,/r/QXCooperative/comments/pdlbxw/working_overtime_hooligan_issue_14/,https://www.reddit.com/r/QXCooperative/comments/pdlbxw/working_overtime_hooligan_issue_14/,0,2021-08-29
I recreate Paranormal experiences,"  

I have a unique job. I re-enact people‚Äôs paranormal experiences. Sounds off the wall when you hear it like that, but it‚Äôll make sense as I explain further. Most people that have watched a touch of basic cable in the last 20 years are familiar with the ‚ÄúMy paranormal story, or haunted experience,‚Äù type of programming. These are usually found on your travel type channels, discovery, ID, etc. Every show has a real simple concept. Person that had ‚Äúreal,‚Äù paranormal experience discusses what happened, an actor (like me,) re-enacts what happened. Couldn‚Äôt be simpler than that right? This has been the cash cow of the paranormal programming world probably since about the year 2000.

I started my career as a commercial actor, had some small roles on tv and announcing, reading ads, stuff like that. I‚Äôve been fortunate to make a career out of finding a niche in the paranormal re-enactment world. Have you seen a commercial actor that you recognize from multiple advertisements and wonder why they are used so frequently? It‚Äôs usually because they have some kind of look that‚Äôs pleasing, or a solid voice if it requires speaking lines. I believe my success is based on the same idea.

I‚Äôll try my best to paint you a small, simple picture of myself. I‚Äôm a mid 30‚Äôs white male. I‚Äôm average height. I‚Äôm slightly overweight. I have dark hair and dark eyes. I can play the ‚Äúperson involved,‚Äù (the P.I. is what call the real person whose paranormal experience we are taping for the day. I know ‚ÄúPerson involved,‚Äù sounds like they are an armed robbery suspect or something, but it‚Äôs just easy on paper, and when we need to identify the persons story we are doing for the day. I can also play the husband, brother, uncle, neighbor, and so on. 

If you‚Äôve watched these type of shows before, it‚Äôs a badly kept secret that the actors barely resemble the real people telling the story. In the producers defense they do really try their best. But as the years went by and the popularity rose for paranormal re-enactment shows, pop culture prevailed and we kind of have a wink at the audience picking some of the actors to re-enact the persons involved. Most people comment things like ‚Äúoh come on, the real person talking about their experience is, sorry don‚Äôt mean to be mean but they‚Äôre like 300 pounds, and the actor portraying them is like a model.‚Äù We get that all the time. It‚Äôs Tv baby, that‚Äôs as simple as I can put it for everyone. You don‚Äôt tune in to watch ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù people all the time. 

That‚Äôs kind of where I come in funny enough. Maybe it was by accident, maybe the producers did it on purpose. Because I‚Äôm so vanilla, I played mostly opposite that role. Whether the P.I (person involved,) was slim or heavy, I just seemed to fit the part. I‚Äôm nothing special, all of us re-enactors are secondary to the story. People in the business liked me though. Call it a non-threatening demeanor or look, the jury is still out. It‚Äôs allowed me to work and provide for myself, so I don‚Äôt mind either way.

That‚Äôs enough for my intro. What follows is possibly my last re-enactment. Maybe my last.. anything.

8 A.M. I pick up some Kellogg‚Äôs cereal and a stale bagel. Hopefully there is some 2% milk left in the fridge near catering. Hell, I‚Äôll take whole right now. This isn‚Äôt a Hollywood studio on the back lot of the Paramount or Warner Bros studio. We film at a small sound stage in a small town in Georgia, about 30 minutes south of Atlanta. I live close by so it‚Äôs convenient for me. I spoke with ‚ÄúTommy D,‚Äù briefly. We went over blocking and what my role entailed today. It‚Äôs always pretty non-thinking as I never have any speaking lines. Makes it easy. Tommy D handles most of the paranormal re-enactment shows on TV today. His claim to fame is making the ‚Äúlove after lockup,‚Äù shows popular. He is very self-aware. Doesn‚Äôt take himself too seriously. It may seem silly to some, what he does, but he‚Äôs passionate and good at it. He‚Äôs always had a good energy about him.

From what I‚Äôve read on this particular script it‚Äôs a run of the mill format. PI hears noises, sees things that seemingly are not there, etc. Pictures fly off the wall and there is a general unease at what they are seeing. The source always comes from the basement. They find an evil totem or something, and possession usually Takes over someone in the house. Same old story. I don‚Äôt judge the PI‚Äôs experience. I‚Äôve never had a paranormal incident in my life but I‚Äôm open minded. I‚Äôve seen and done so many of these that I have no reason to not believe these folks. 

After doing some rehearsals and feeling confident enough to tape, I try to find the PI. It‚Äôs always best to pick the brain of the man or woman that this happened to. I asked one of the production assistants where they were, and they pointed him out. I immediately locked eyes with him. He was staring right at me, like he was watching me the entire time. I felt an odd rush of emotions. Scared, odd, off-putting. Shaking those feelings, I took one step toward him, and he was ushered off into one of the other sound stages. I guess it was time for him to tape his interview portion. I just wanted to speak to him for a moment, get some deeper insight into what he went through. I was playing him after all, the star of the show as it were.

I taped most of the episode in a few hours. Might be some minor re-shoots but since I‚Äôm so close they know it won‚Äôt be an issue. One of the other great things about living so close. All I had to do was react to some items flying off the walls, pretending to see shadows and unknown entities from the corner of my eye. I had a quick basement scene where I picked up a straw stick figure like thing from the ground. Always interested to see the show when it airs live on television. Like I said I usually try to speak to the PI to get the ‚Äútrue story,‚Äù so I have a better understanding from them. Doesn‚Äôt always happen, like this time, but I tried.

Pulling up to my modest suburban home, I decided to park on the street so I could clean my garage out later in the night. As soon as I shut my door, I saw what looked like a note pasted to my front door. I wasn‚Äôt expecting any deliveries. Getting closer, my heart drops. From more than 10 feet away I see two clear dark letters on the face of the white paper. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sorry.‚Äù The words looked like they were scribbled by a madman. When I got closer, in a daze, I inspected the paper. It wasn‚Äôt just one piece of paper. It was a folded little sheet of note paper. Shakily opening the note, I saw a few sentences scribbled out:

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want this to happen this way, but I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I saw an opportunity and I took it. May God bless your soul.‚Äù

After reading that I was surprisingly at ease. Just a dumb prank by some kids in the neighborhood. It‚Äôs October, and I figured it was just part of the Halloween spooky season to make mischief. No harm, no foul.

That night felt like a haze. I had a nightmare that I saw shadows, heard devilish noises, and saw red eyes staring at me from inside my bedroom. When I awoke, I tried my best to shake the feeling that something nefarious was happening. I had a commercial shoot today, but called the producer, saying I had virus-like symptoms. Didn‚Äôt want to alarm them so I said I‚Äôd take a test and update them later in the day. I just wanted to wrap up in a blanket and watch some mind-numbing internet videos.  

Jolting awake, seeing that I‚Äôve been asleep for the better part of the day, I was kind of bummed out that it‚Äôs dark outside and lost an entire day. I didn‚Äôt know how tired I was. I texted one of the producers of the commercial I was supposed to be at today that I was virus free, even though I never had any sickness, or took any test, and would be more than willing to work with them again. All I wanted was to make a hot cup of coffee and take a shower.

I never got that coffee.  As soon as I started the pot, I felt like something was wrong. I slowly pulled my favorite coffee cup from the cupboard and placed it close to the coffee maker. Turning my back for a moment, I heard a thundering crash. Whipping my body around, I can see my favorite cup is destroyed in the corner of my living room. The force and distance my cup endured is just.. I can‚Äôt explain it. I stared at the broken cup while a whoosing sound blows by my right ear. What the.. what the hell is happening? I‚Äôm feeling out of my mind. At this time I see the note in the counter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sorry.‚Äù

What I‚Äôve been going through is almost exactly what I just re-enacted on that last paranormal experience show. I‚Äôm in for another sleepless night. If I make it one more night I have some people to talk to.

Thankfully nothing happened during the night. I needed to get in contact with the person involved in that last re-enactment. I made a couple calls and texts to the production assistants I have in my phone. No responses. I even reached out to Tommy D. Nothing. I decided to drive to the soundstage. My confusion was immersible when I arrived. Everything was gone. Not possible. This little studio has been around for almost a decade. It wouldn‚Äôt just disappear overnight, what the hell is happening.

Pulling up back at home, feeling defeated, I have a sick feeling that hasn‚Äôt quite left me the past couple days. I just want to lay down upstairs in my bed. Walking up the stairs I‚Äôm frozen by a black mass with what appears to be horns protruding above an evil looking face. Blinking quickly, the anomaly disappears. I cautiously slid into bed, pulling the covers over my entire body. 

In an instant I woke up, cold sweat, head on fire. The blazing red numbers on my bed-side clock displayed the time of 3 am. Not a good sign. Without thinking I made my way downstairs, like I was guided by an invisible force. Picture frames fly off the walls as I make my way into the basement. At the foot of the stairs, I see a figure wrapped in straw on the ground. I fall to my knees forcefully, expelling what feels like every bit of liquid from my body. Looking through tear-soaked eyes, I try to focus on this evil totem in front of my face. Tendrils cloud my vision, attaching themselves onto my hands and arms.

Looking toward a closet door, I see red light emanating from beyond it. There‚Äôs a small white piece of paper posted on it. I can see the two words displaying itself to me: ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù",BlackeyedStories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackeyedStories/comments/pdlnz9/i_recreate_paranormal_experiences/,,leoofalexandria,pdlnz9,/r/BlackeyedStories/comments/pdlnz9/i_recreate_paranormal_experiences/,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackeyedStories/comments/pdlnz9/i_recreate_paranormal_experiences/,0,2021-08-29

[M4F] Chatting with daddy,"Hey there fellow DPP browser! I bet you're here because you saw the word daddy in the title right? You know younger girls like you can't resist an older guy like me and to be fair older guys like me can't resist you either. What is it about being called daddy that drives both of us wild? What is it for girls like you? Is it the hungry looks you get from guys like us, ones full of desire, or is it just that older guys know just what they want and aren't afraid to ask for it? I know for me it's that feeling of being desired by someone anyone would consider young and sexy.

So what kind of daddy am I? Well, I'm definitely on the softer side, though I have no problem getting a bit rough. I mean even plenty of good girls enjoy a little spanking, right? I'm definitely the type to shower my good girl with plenty of praise. And it probably goes without saying here but, daddy is always horny and ready to play with his good girl.

One of my favorite prompts is the neighbor with a pool. I mean who can resist a pool so close by in the summer, it would certainly save you from a trip in the hot car all the way to the crowded public pool. I mean you're just home from college, there's no way you are paying for some private club, right? Sure your neighbor enjoys looking at you in your bikini quite a bit, but that kind of thing would happen way more at the public pool anyway, right? And to be honest, you don't really mind his attention. He's even kind of attractive in that older man sort of way. So maybe on days you know your parents won't be around, you come over in a much more revealing bikini, as a tease and a thank you. But it's clear he's interested in more than a tease, and after a few times teasing him you're starting to think about it more. I mean he is pretty attractive and even nice enough to let your friends come by too. Why not?

So today I want to chat with any girls who like older guys and calling them daddy. Tell me all the naughty things you think about when you hear the word, daddy. All while I shower you with plenty of praise for how young and sexy you are. Anything that turns you on about older guys! And by all means, ask me all about what guys like me love about girls like you. I know I won't be able to resist telling you all about it.

If we really have fun we could even chat long term ;) If interested we could also move to discord at some point. 18+ only, please!!!

DM anytime! Kinks: dirty talk, ddlg, gentle sex, rough sex, blowjobs, deepthroat, face fucking, anal, cum play, creampies, spanking, being called daddy, hair pulling, pet play, collars, leashes, and more

PM or chat is fine. Can't wait to hear from you.

As long as this is up I'm still looking.",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdmncm/m4f_chatting_with_daddy/,Chat,jersey_temp,pdmncm,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdmncm/m4f_chatting_with_daddy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pdmncm/m4f_chatting_with_daddy/,0,2021-08-29
"On and off lurker, I hope this is on topic enough! I know what I want to do and am mostly knowledgeable about the path to getting there, but I need to work out some of the more nitty gritty kinks","I, recently 24 F, know what I want to do with life. I want to do UX and pentesting. I am living at home still (with grandparents, well now grandma with recently deceased grandfather) which is majorly psychologically abusive, but had gotten way, WAY better in recent months (basically, she's rekindling out relationship via effort for the first time due to me being her last choice/last ditch effort to nix her loneliness and because she knows that I won't take the 'bait' she puts out like my grandpa would. So getting out is less TECHNICALLY URGENT now, but I am VERY impacted by not spreading my wings earlier and wanting to get out ASAP is a no-question, no-brainer for me. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I live in Illinois. In the south suburbs of Chicago. It's the last suburb before the boonies hit, hell, I'd even call it the very first small boonie. I can take the train to Chicago. I do sometimes. I would like to live in Chicago. I have my neighborhood picked out. I have been sick and tired of living in this small little town with a population below even the tens of thousands and only a few dozen businesses. As a young adult, it's honestly impacted my mental health as frivilous as that sounds, and I've let it enable me and it's helped me to enable me to isolate out of depression which was been VERY unhealthy for me. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I am not yet ready to go into tech, as I am not yet meeting the qualifications. I am wanting to get a job to have for a stream of income for now, and I want to be a little bit pickier with where I apply than I was with my last jobs. For example, I used to work at fast food and drugstores, but now I want something like Nordstrom, Target's AP, clerical, etc. Something a little bit nicer. I am looking at applying for Kirkland's as well. You get the drift. 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

The ask I am asking for for these positions is $16.32 or $30k, which is asking a little much for retail standards, but it is what I am comfortable with. The way I got this number was via these estimates:

[https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/17197](https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/17197)

[https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/17031](https://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/17031)

(It says cook and will are the same, though I find that hard to believe????)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

There are some places I'm thinking of applying to the city (one I already did, and was wondering if I should have after I realized what I'm about to ask in this post, my point for posting) and some suburbs that are further away from me. If I were to commute to the coffee place, for example, I would have to lyft there which would cost $50-75 each way, because if I were to take public transport the times would not work out. If I were to work at this wine warehouse for a nightshift that I am thinking of applying to in a suburb, it would be $50 each way to lyft. I'm sure there are some in the city and in the suburbs that I could make public transportation work for, but I'm guessing the commute would be like 3 hours. So imagine, 6 hours on a train a day, 3 hours each. What time does that give me left of my day?

Now this wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the tech thing. But my plan with getting a job right now is to be able to continue to afford to educate myself on the tech field I am planning to go into, so courses, books, mentors, linkedin premium, etc. I already have a linkedin presence for my aspiring tech propositions but am still yet not meeting qualifications and I have made that clear on my profile that I am not ""there"" yet but learning and looking to enter the field after. Also, stupid question, but would a prospective employer at something like what I've been applying for (higher end of low end retail, AP, coffee, etc) find it a turn off or red flag that I have a linkedin profile that suggests I have plans to go into a whole other field? Like why should we hire her, she's gonna dip type of deal? I also need this job because I need money to eat and wash my ass, as I have NO income and my household has always been struggling by quite a bit. Also, another stupid question, would I even be ALLOWED to do coffee as someone who cannot food handle due to serious food allergies? I am more than willing to touch beverages and any foods that I don't have to directly have contact with that contain my allergens (for ex, I will come into direct contact with any food that does not contain my allergens, but if a food does, I will not be willing to handle it, even through gloves, unless it is in a really sturdy wrapper or box, that would have no potential of crumbs falling out or touching me even a tiny bit on accident)? 

Now the reason the commute is an issue for the tech thing. See, if I was going into some other field I would just read books for my field on the 6 hours on the train. But tech is something that needs to be studied with implementation too, yaknow? And I don't think lugging around a laptop on the train or ubers is a very safe idea? Reading on the train and implementing at home would be a waste as all I would be doing is reading the material over, therefore doubling the time it takes 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I REALLY want to move to the city. Like, desperately so. I truly need to enjoy what the city has to offer. I haven't socialized much my whole life and I'm getting up there in age now. I have ALWAYS, ALWAYS been a city girl at heart, but have been dragged to suburbs since I was 5.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I feel like my ask is high for the types of jobs I'll be applying for, and worse, if I apply to the city or suburbs farther from me , instead of asking for $16.32 I'd be asking for around $19 to be able to afford my commute. Maybe $20. But I have worked for lower wages in the past and I feel I have grown up from that, and I always felt so degraded and I would literally just rather not work until I find somebody willing to give me my ask. 

Because of this, I feel like maybe I should seek out city and bigger suburbs who may have the budget for it. However, they may also think, ‚Äúwhy should we hire someone from the suburbs/farther suburbs if we don‚Äôt have to?‚Äù 

&amp;amp;#x200B;

I don't want to run myself around in circles if the chances are that this won't work out. I am trying to move to Chicago but I want to make sure my plan is solid. I am sure I have many, many blindspots here and I am asking you guys to tell me them and to help me and offer advice, Thank you",findapath,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/pdm740/on_and_off_lurker_i_hope_this_is_on_topic_enough/,,ichillonforums,pdm740,/r/findapath/comments/pdm740/on_and_off_lurker_i_hope_this_is_on_topic_enough/,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/pdm740/on_and_off_lurker_i_hope_this_is_on_topic_enough/,0,2021-08-29

\~2056 Anno Domini\~   
  
    
  Solus wiped a bead of sweat from his brow. Talking to people, especially large groups, was never his strong suit. When the topic was boring or routine it was fine‚Äîpeople never really cared too much of what he had to say, plus it would end up being transcribed and put on the internet if they wanted to read it later. But ever since Marisa left, each address had been attended by more and more people. And each time they attended hushed, clinging to his words with greater and greater importance. That afternoon was going to be the most dreaded one yet, but he consoled himself with the understanding that the people cared about death more than they did him. That, and a shot of hooch.     
    
  He robed himself in regal attire for each address, long flowing garments adorned with decorative metal plates, a crown, and a cape. His hair and beard were combed fine and straight, a bit of oil and wax rubbed in for styling. Coffee spilled out on his breath.       
    
  To his dismay Aster was nowhere to be seen. The communications center had seen her constant labor ever since Marisa's departure, so she had little time to encourage her husband before his speech.     
    
  Solus stared into a pair of dying eyes in his desk mirror. The speech would be almost routine; the last one had been the big news that a link was established with Tyrstoll. It was great for the people then, finally they were no longer alone. Now it was just more of the same, another colony, more people, more questions.     
    
  Solus took a deep breath, letting it out through his shoulders. He raised himself carefully from his chair, and sauntered out of the castle. Citizens watched him appear from behind a makeshift stage, babbling among themselves.     
    
  A microphone in the center of the stage sprung to life at his approach. He tapped it twice, clearing his throat.     
    
  ‚ÄúBrothers and sisters of LaCei, I come to you today with good news. Many of you have been buzzing around since we linked up with Tyrstoll. I can tell you, it's felt good to see you all in better spirits. That's not to say there hasn't been any apprehension. My wife and I have felt your unease, rest assured. We never heard directly from Marisa once we made contact with Tyrstoll. But we knew it was only a matter of days until we would hear from her in Sophrondell. It's been a week, yes, but now I can say with much joy, that as of today we will have contact with them. Sophrondell *has* been reached.‚Äù     
    
  The crowd erupted into cheers of joy. A Martian Spring had swept across the colony since they made first contact with another people. Now Solus could see his people invigorate in real time. People had hope, true hope. Marisa was turning from a fool on a suicide mission, to a folk hero in their eyes. Shouts overlapped one another as people blurted questions.     
    
  ‚ÄúWhat did she say?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúWhat next?‚Äù     
    
  Solus raised a flat palm, quieting the shouts back down to an energized chatter. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, there was an error on our end and we weren't able to connect with Sophrondell immediately. She left three days ago, and as far as we know she is on route to Dujib. She didn't leave any explicit note other than wishing us her best, but we did receive a transcript in the initial data package sent by Sophrondell. It reads:    
     
     
     
   Marisa Lacerta has made contact with Sophrondell. She has spoken to the council on matters both pertinent to us and yourselves. We would like you to know that she is in fine health as of departure. She arrived during a dust storm three days prior and her cruiser broke down roughly nine kilometers west of the colony. Our Dangerous Environment Search and Rescue Team aided her and brought both her and her cruiser back to Sophrondell. Her cruiser has been repaired and outfitted to better withstand the storms utilizing technology from our colony. She was also kind enough to let our mechanics study her cruiser and make notes on how to better our own. We should have usable cruisers for trade caravans to your colony within thirty sols. Thanks to the map data she has provided we can get to your colony in a matter of ten sols. If you have any provisions or excess agricultural equipment, we would request a trade. We haven't much, and are in desperate need of food. Upon reaching Dujib she is to deliver a similar message to their leader.    	

   Your Marisa is an angel of these wastes. Should our colonies survive to see another generation, we shall forever be in your debt.    
  

 Signed,  Rebecca Clark, Director of Communications    
  
  

  
  Solus didn't bother quieting the explosive celebration, instead talking over them with personal vigor. ‚ÄúBy our calculations, she should reach Dujib in around two more sols. From what we know they are an isolated, fully independent colony. They haven't had any assistance from Earth in years now. We know they have livestock, a means to terraform and enough power generation for their colony. What we don't know is whether or not they'll cooperate with us. I can however, personally attest to their leadership and his character. He's a good man, one who understands the plight of an impoverished people.     
    
  ‚ÄúWith that being said, there is one other announcement to be made. We have received news from Tyrstoll leadership that on Sol 468 Marisa will be meeting with other colony leaders in person at Tyrstoll. There will be talks of government, of forging a new system where we are not so alien to one another. I will be taking a temporary leave on Sol 460 with a caravan of cruisers that have been under intense scrutiny by Queen Aster. These cruisers, while not as powerful or durable as the Angel of the Red Sun, should be strong enough to get us there and back with ease. It is uncertain what the outcome on this meeting will be, but our hopes are of a united Mars, where people can have food, wealth, and happiness. I ask that you continue to hold on to your hope, and that you don't succumb to fear or panic. We will get through this, we are strong. Valosol.‚Äù     
    
  As he gestured for a microphone to be handed out to the press, an aide shuffled on stage. The first reporter didn't even have time to ask a question before Solus's eyes widened at the aide's whispers. Solus whispered a few questions back, receiving answers that sent his heart racing.     
    
  ‚ÄúI apologize,‚Äù Solus rushed, turning back to the microphone. ‚ÄúIt seems something important has come up, and I‚Äî‚Äù     
    
  Before he could finish, a roar grew on the horizon, becoming louder with every passing moment until a mighty aerial behemoth appeared overhead. It flew over the colony, imparting a shadow onto Solus and those in the crowd for a brief moment, before passing and stopping midair on the western side of the dome. As it slowed and began its descent, the crowd grew wild. Chaos bred through the people like a plague, unable to be calmed by the words of their king alone. Gradually, the crowd dissipated, rushing to the far end of the colony with Solus hobbling behind.   
    
    
    
  \*\*\*   
  
    
  Aster was in the communications tower when they picked up a transmission from an unknown aircraft. Nobody was sure what they were seeing was what they thought, and few were quick to make any decisions regarding the matter. Most of the workers turned to Aster who busied herself studying the screen, forming a judgment in her mind. Presently, she dialed one of the aides who she knew would be at the speech, told him to inform Solus that in a matter of minutes an unidentified plane would be coming from overhead. She paused, making sure he understood, then let him know it came from the east. The aide was at a loss for words when Aster thanked him abruptly and hung up the call.     
    
  To her surprise, the aircraft made its way to them in less than half the time that they thought. It appeared suddenly, shaking the air and filling it with a monstrous growl that precipitated her brow with fear. As far as she, or Solus, or anyone was aware, their colony was the farthest east civilization on Mars. Plus, none of the colonies in the Alpha Program had the resources for aircraft. Now, a plane more advanced than any she had seen before had made its way to them. It was sleek, black, like the SR-71s of the romanticized past. It had speed to rival Hermes, faster than anything else on the planet.     
    
  The plane itself had to whip around before landing, having overshot the colony during deceleration, disappearing and reappearing through the dust storm and landing on the ground just outside the garage. It touched down gently, sitting there completely still.     
    
  Aster readied herself and made way down to the garage. There was an auxiliary shaft that connected the communication center to the garage that she took, cutting out a few minutes of travel and spitting her out near the main airlock. She grabbed one of the Extra-Colonial Activity breather helmets, twisting it on her suit's collar, locking it in place. Unlike Solus and Marisa she didn't carry a sword, opting instead for a truncheon she used in combination with close-quarters-combat training she received on Earth.       
    
  As she exited the airlock she saw a person climbing out of the plane's cockpit. They moved cautiously and with uncertainty, at one point dropping themselves from the step ladder and landing on the ground with a stumble. They stood up slowly, patting down their legs, and noticed Aster standing by the door, watching them with crossed arms. The person stood up straight at the sight of her, and offered a cheerful wave, before striding over in dignified steps.     
    
  The suit of the outsider was unlike anything seen in the Orion-Alpha line. Usually, OA suits were white or shades of gray, but this was a stark black. Where there were usually pads and angles under the fabric that made the otherwise sleek design look armored, there was nothing. The stranger glided across the sands like a wisp, broken up partially by  dust that swirled about. As they got close, Aster noticed the helmet was tinted a deep blue, like the midsummer sky of her childhood home.     
    
  Getting closer, the person began gesturing at random, moving their arms and hands about before stopping in place at the sight of Aster gripping her truncheon. The two stood only a dozen feet apart from one another, staring intently, unflinching.     
    
  ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù The voice of the stranger belonged to a man. He spoke with a moderate accent that was hard for Aster to place.     
    
  Aster fiddled with a mechanism on the back of her wrist, switching her communication to an open channel to match the stranger. ‚ÄúGreetings.‚Äù     
    
  The stranger clapped his hands together with delight. ‚ÄúAh good! My apologies, my communications were set to a different default. That's a bit embarrassing.‚Äù He spoke eloquently, a jaunty lilt to his voice. ‚ÄúAs I tried saying before: hello, my name is Sami Khalil, I am the head diplomat for Ma'Khalil to the colonies of the Orion-Alpha Program.‚Äù Sami walked forward a bit and extended his hand. ‚ÄúIt is good to see your colony still bustling.‚Äù His extended hand motioned over to the glass wall by the garage where a swarm of people had amassed on the other side. ‚ÄúThey look healthy. That is good.‚Äù     
    
  Aster hesitated to remove her hand from the truncheon. Looking over her shoulder she noticed a growing group of people who stared at her, waiting for a reaction. ‚ÄúAster,‚Äù she said, tearing her hand away from her hip, shaking the man's hand. ‚ÄúI'm the second in command around here. My husband is the leader and should be on his way.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúAh, good, good. We have much to discuss. I must say we were getting worried when we didn't get a response from any of you. We had our suspicions that when the United Nations terminated the Orion Program that they may have fried your communications.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúYou would be right. We've only recently established a link to two of the other colonies. Right now, you're the first outsider we've seen in person.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúSo they not only cut off your inter-terrestrial communications, but your inter-colonial ones too then, hmm? You know, I was told to visit Tyrstoll before any of the other colonies, but my flight path took me over your colony. I couldn't pass up the opportunity.‚Äù He looked around, admiring the parts of LaCei he could see through the dome. ‚ÄúI'll admit we have very little data on LaCei, I figured it wouldn't hurt to chance a visit.‚Äù     
    
  Aster eyed the man up and down. ‚ÄúAlright, come on inside. I regret to say that we can't fit your ship in the garage. Hopefully the storm won't wear it out too bad.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúAh it's just a storm,‚Äù Sami said. ‚ÄúMy craft would need to be built pretty sparingly to take any damage from it.‚Äù     
    
  Aster pursed her lips. She took Sami through the airlock and into the garage where a mass of people stood back, held in place by their own intrigue. Among them, Solus presented himself with a more than curious expression.     
    
  It took thirty minutes, some stealth, and a lot of crowd control on the guards' part for Solus and Sami to make their way to the castle on the other side of the colony. The crowd of people‚Äîwhich only grew with time‚Äîwas hesitant to let the stranger by without extensive questioning.       
    
  Some of the First-Martianers looked at Sami with awe. They had never seen a man with such dark skin before in person. They had seen different races in the media they consumed from the data packages, but never in real life. Some of the older citizens who came from Earth had vulgar and distasteful things to say about the man, their complaints flittering away in the air as their juniors ignored them. Everyone, however, was adamant in seeing the man, asking questions, getting answers. Instead, Aster stopped them and gave an address herself with the information she had been given. She instructed a personnel to bring the two to the castle while another group of guards hesitantly held back the mass of civilians. Once it was clear that nobody was getting an easy way through to the stranger or the king, they shuffled about into a circle while Aster spoke.     
    
  People grumbled to themselves in dissatisfaction from the lack of information given. As quickly as they massed together, they disbanded, letting Aster sigh in relief and saunter down the road back to the castle.   
    
    
    
  \*\*\*   
  
    
  Solus opened the door to his office. The walls were painted a soft green, with a light trim that lent a Terran coziness to the room. A round wooden table stood against the far corner near a window that looked out over the Hydraotes Chaos. Solus gestured to a leather chair beside the table for Sami to sit in, and followed suit himself..     
    
  ‚ÄúCare for a drink?‚Äù Solus asked, pulling a bottle of grain alcohol from a secret compartment in the wall.       
    
  Sami chuckled to himself. ‚ÄúSure, I could use something to soothe the troubles.‚Äù     
    
  A pair of glasses followed the bottle out of the compartment, each filling up a third of the way with clear pungent fluid. ‚ÄúTroubles, eh? May I lend an ear?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúAh it's nothing,‚Äù Sami said, bringing the glass up to his mouth. The odor caused his hand to jerk away and his throat to sputter, with water pooling in his eyes. ‚ÄúThis is‚Äî‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúMoonshine, essentially.‚Äù Solus shrugged, bracing himself before taking the initial drink. ‚ÄúIn a perfect world we'd have the resources or knowledge to make some damn rum.‚Äù     
    
  Sami took a drink, shaking off a chill that ran down his spine. ‚ÄúMakes me homesick for beer.‚Äù He took another drink, cautiously, gulping it down without a scene. ‚ÄúBut my troubles are little. At least, in comparison to yours. I just need to decompress after flying that aircraft is all.‚Äù     
    
  Solus leaned in across the table. ‚ÄúSo tell me, what are you doing here? Where did you come from? Do you know anything about Earth? I have so many questions.‚Äù     
    
  Sami sipped the liquor, composing his thoughts. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said at length. ‚ÄúI've been told you haven't any contact with any of the other Alpha Colonies, is that right?‚Äù     
    
  Solus's face dropped. ‚ÄúThat's right. We sent a diplomat to the other colonies. She's in the process of fixing our communications.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúOh? That's wonderful, how many colonies has she visited?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúShe should be near the third colony as we speak. She's already established a link with Tyrstoll and Sophrondell.‚Äù Solus looked up at Sami. Indistinct sections of his face twitched as his composure wavered.     
    
  ‚ÄúAh, that's great, no? Soon all the Alpha Colonies will be in communication together.‚Äù Sami smiled, wishing to raise the king's mood. ‚ÄúYou don't seem so enthused.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúThe diplomat is my daughter.‚Äù Solus grumbled, taking a hearty quaff of his poison. ‚ÄúWe sent her out on a cruiser. It's been a few weeks already.‚Äù     
    
  Sami clasped his hands close to his chest. ‚ÄúI understand, you have a father's worry.‚Äù     
    
  Solus's mouth contorted into a scowl. Keeping his head cast down towards the table he asked with a tone of resentment: ‚ÄúTell me, did I send my daughter out into the wastes for nothing? If you're a diplomat coming to sync up communications, did we only need to wait? Where did you even come from? I don't understand.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúAh, ah, it's alright, you couldn't have known. In actuality, it's the mark of a good leader to make necessary sacrifices in the face of‚Äî‚Äù     
    
  Solus slammed his fist on the table. ‚ÄúI sent my *daughter* out there! Leadership be damned!‚Äù His face almost broke, the air in his lungs darting out ragged with fury. In an instant he was shattered‚Äîif for the moment‚Äîleaning back in his seat as the booze loosened his composure. ‚ÄúWhat is leadership, if I've failed as a father?‚Äù     
    
  Sami leaned back in his seat, gazing wide-eyed at the king, watching him throw himself to the hounds of grief. Presently, the king's face had turned a bright red and his breathing became long and controlled, quivering ever so subtly. It seemed the situation had been weighing on him for some time, evident by his rough complexion.     
    
  ‚ÄúI am sorry,‚Äù Sami said sullenly. ‚ÄúI would go out and help her, but my aircraft has experienced some internal damage, it is the truth of why I stopped here instead of Tyrstoll, though I'm ashamed to have been unable to make the confession to your wife. It will take some time to fix I fear, but afterward I can meet up with your daughter if you would like.‚Äù     
    
  Solus spoke with his head in his hands. ‚ÄúIt's fine. Just tell me where the hell you're from.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúWell, as you know, my name is Sami Khalil. I'm from a royal family known as House Khalil. We are the financial and political leaders of the Orion-Omega Program.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúOrion-Omega? But that project was scrapped.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúYes, it was. All the 'developed' nations of Earth received funding from the United Nations, so they were the ones to be sent on the Alpha Program to colonize Mars. People tend to forget however, that a lot of other countries were a part of the Orion Program, so once it all fell through the cracks there were naturally several upset governments. As the threat of destruction loomed overhead all across the world, the countries that had been stifled by the United Nations banded together to restart the Orion-Omega Program, and so here we are. From the Arabia Terra to the Terra Cimmeria we have seven colonies, each sponsored by the Trans-African Aerospace Coalition.       
    
  ‚ÄúThere were other, non-TAAC countries who began their colonization efforts sure, but because House Khalil has so much wealth, they were able to revive the Omega Program and secure the rights to martian colonization for TAAC specific countries. The other countries that were barred from the Omega Program were given the rights to build mega-stations out in space. I believe Japan and Greece were building their own stations, and India managed to secure the rights to a Jupiter colony. The paperwork is mostly covered in black ink though, so I don't have much information on it. I know Argentina was to join the United Nations efforts on Venus, but‚Äî‚Äù     
    
  Sami stopped himself, fidgeting with his hands and taking another sip of his drink. A nervousness overtook him and his eyes darted around the room until they landed back on Solus who was staring at him expectantly. ‚ÄúDid‚Äîdo you... The Orion-Alpha Program had satellites for contact with Venus right? Have you received any word from them at all?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Solus shook his head slowly. ‚ÄúWe only ever got information on the Venutian relayed through Earth's comms. Before they went dark they stopped giving us updates on it, stopped answering our questions. What's been happening with it?‚Äù     
    
  Sami rubbed at his chin, his muscles twitching nervously. ‚ÄúI was hoping you would know. The Alpha Program was our last hope in finding out.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúWhy didn't you just send someone out to Venus? You clearly had the resources to send people here.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúWell you see, it was Argentina leading up the Venutian side of the Program. They were going to join Germany, Austria, and Hungary, but... Well, they were scared.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúScared?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúI don't blame them. Nobody else was exactly *eager* to find out what happened.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúI don't understand,‚Äù Solus set his empty glass down on the table, refilling it slowly. ‚ÄúWhat happened on Venus?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúNobody knows. Everything was fine until the messages started coming in scrambled. We told them to fix their comms, but they assured us everything was working fine on their end. Then one day they sounded panicked. Fewer and fewer words were intelligible through the static, but they kept assuring Earth that everything was fine. The panic grew over the course of a week, and then... It all just stopped. There was a week of no contact, and then the last message sent...‚Äù Sami looked to have seen death incarnate. ‚ÄúIt was... not inhuman. No. But... adjacent. Nobody understood when it happened, there have been numerous conspiracies but everyone's been too afraid to check. That was maybe a month before Earth cut its communication with Mars.‚Äù     
    
  An uncertain sense of dread formed a lump in Solus' throat. ‚ÄúThe last message, what did it say?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúIt was one word, as if spoken through man and machine: Zaozoruzhna.‚Äù     
    
  Solus was silent for a moment. ‚ÄúWhat the hell does that mean?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúNobody knows.‚Äù     
    
  The men were silent for sometime, digesting the information.       
    
  ‚ÄúEarth,‚Äù Solus said presently. ‚ÄúWhat happened to Earth. Why did it go dark?‚Äù     
    
  A pained smile left Sami's face, followed by a saddening chuckle. ‚ÄúWhat didn't happen? When you think about it, it happened so fast it's hard to remember it all.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúSami, please. My people, they need to know. I need to know.‚Äù     
    
  The ensuing silence was cut short by a prolonged sigh. Sami leaned forward on the table, bracing himself against his elbows. ‚ÄúIf you want to know, then I'll tell you. But nothing about it is pretty. Earth 'went dark' as you say out of hubris. As I'm sure you're aware, the United States and China were poised to enter a nuclear war with one another. In America, the eastern seaboard is a radioactive wasteland, and the entirety of Eastern China is the same. Both Washington D.C. And Beijing have been reduced to rubble. All the countries that claimed they were 'allies' with either America or China backed out before the bombs fell, and saved themselves from holocaust, but tensions around the world had been rising at that point for all manner of reasons.       
    
  ‚ÄúYears before the war, most of the Chinese workforce had managed to flee the country. Those that remained died in the wartime manufacturing camps, a similar fate to their American counterpart. Before any bombs fell, China's economy caved in on itself, which sent a rippling effect across the world. Many countries ended up in recession. Because of that, many countries reverted back to using fossil fuels and coal to supplement their alternative fuel sources. You're familiar with how close we got in the late twenties to irreversible climate change, yes?‚Äù     
    
  Solus nodded. It had been the primary factor for the Alpha Program. Most of the countries had set aside their differences to ensure that humanity would be able to live on in the stars. In retrospect they hadn't done a very good job, but he didn't have anybody to complain to but himself.     
    
  ‚ÄúWell, with the sudden upsurge of pollutants, coupled with a rise in authoritarianism that put profits over well-being, we managed to revert our progress back to what it was in the twenties in a matter of years. Just a few more months of exponentially increasing production worldwide, and we began seeing a complete desertification of Central America and Northern Africa. People have come to affectionately refer to it as 'The Belt.' The whole area is uninhabitable.     
    
  ‚ÄúThere were also natural disasters that all hit within a short timeframe of one another. Australia wound up with an unprecedentedly large bushfire that killed off around a third of their population. Much of the southern United States, along with Italy, Greece, and several other European and southeast Asian countries wound up underwater. Rising temperatures melted northern glaciers you see, but also released ancient viruses that had lain dormant within the permafrost. So naturally, Canada and Russia fell to a plague which then spread across the world, crippling the global economies even more.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Sami snapped out of his retrospection. ‚ÄúYou look surprised, surely as leader you were briefed on all this before Earth cut its communications, no?‚Äù     
    
  Solus shook his head.     
    
  ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù Sami stroked his chin. ‚ÄúThen let me continue. The same year this all happened also managed to be a year for locust swarms. As I mentioned, North Africa had become victim to desertification so bad, that most people fled south to the more habitable countries. Because of this, the swarm moved north into Europe and Asia, ransacking the food supply and causing famine. All this strife is what led to tensions flaring as high as they did and the nukes being launched. Nobody was really thinking at that point‚Äîat least, I doubt they were‚Äîand the whole global economy just sort of sunk.     
    
  ‚ÄúNow, all the countries I mentioned that were a part of the Orion-Omega Program? We witnessed the world entering an age of strife and pooled all the money and resources we had before the plague, disasters, and depressions showed up, and got a heavy majority of each country's populace off the Earth. Even India managed to move a few million people. It's a shame though, most of the people who left India were men. Now they're expecting a drastic population decline on both Earth and their Jovian colony.      
     
   ‚ÄúWe were lucky in Africa, we had been mostly untouched. As countries began to decline and come to ruin, most of their scientists and engineers made their way to us, the one safe place left on Earth. Eventually, we opened the gates to refugees with notable skills, although we had to bar thousands‚Äîupwards of millions‚Äîof people from entering. It was sad, but we had finally come together as a continent, with capable leaders ruling the countries, and we couldn't risk a massive refugee crisis to disturb that.     
    
  ‚ÄúBut yes, to answer your question, that is the brief overview of why Earth has cut its communications. You must forgive me, it's hard to remember *everything* that has happened in the last few years, but we have all the information archived in Ma'Khalil, and will be able to share it with you once our communication systems are connected.‚Äù      
     
   Solus sat pale as a ghost in his chair. Everything he had heard was somehow far worse than he could have ever expected. All the countries on Earth were in ruin. His heart ached, a throbbing pang of sorrow beat at the back of his skull. The lump in his throat had only increased in size and made it impossible to squeeze any words out.      
     
   ‚ÄúYou know, Your Majesty,‚Äù Sami muttered. ‚ÄúIf I may be perfectly candid with you?‚Äù He looked at Solus, who stared back with deadened eyes. Sami took his silence as approval. ‚ÄúThe Ma'Khalil government‚Äîwell, we have a very good information network that we carried over from Africa. And as it turns out, an acquaintance of yours had made his way some decades ago to our shores and earned himself a government job.‚Äù      
     
   The expression on Solus' face turned grim. Slowly he straightened out his back and forgot about his grief for the moment, gripping the pommel of his sword tight.     
    
  ‚ÄúFrom your expression, I can assume you know where this is headed. While we are keeping it one-hundred percent confidential within the government, we *do* know, and I *was* briefed on your Terran identity before leaving on this mission.‚Äù      
     
   ‚ÄúWhat do you intend to do with the information?‚Äù Solus growled. He was ready to cut his guest down in an instant, with no thoughts as to the ramifications.      
     
   ‚ÄúNothing, Your Majesty,‚Äù Sami said with a smile. ‚ÄúIt's just, ah, I was wary to tell you the state of your country should you not want to hear it.‚Äù      
     
   ‚ÄúAmerica is my country.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúYou know what I mean.‚Äù     
    
  Emotions clashed in his mind, racking his body with uncertainty. Seeds of doubt had been sewn towards the man, and he wanted to believe that the words Sami spoke were false. It was too sweet a fruit, such ignorance, not to be picked, yet he relented, accepting his grim words as truth. Regardless of the states of America, Russia, and France, he feared the truth of his home above all. It was a section of his life he had tried to forget, to ensure the safety of his family and his people. But he could never forget, try as he might. Nobody could ever truly forget their home.     
    
  After deliberating to himself for what felt like eternity, he looked up at Sami's pained eyes. ‚ÄúTell me. Please. What happened?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù     
  Sami collected himself, inhaled deep. ‚ÄúAfter the bombs fell on America, it triggered an earthquake.‚Äù     
    
  Knots twisted up inside Solus' stomach such that he felt the need to vomit. His nerves were shooting through his body at breakneck speed, sweat coating his back and underarms in thick layers. It was almost hard to hear the man speak over the sound of his screaming heart.     
    
  ‚ÄúTsunami.‚Äù Solus croaked.     
    
  ‚ÄúThe Big One, as they called it.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúThe President, did he..?‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúFrom what I heard, he was giving a speech in the capital when the bombs fell. He was reassuring a scared people that the bombs wouldn't touch their borders. His body was found in the rubble of the city square, they suspect he died before the tsunami even hit, crushed from the quake.‚Äù     
    
  Solus stared past Sami. Tears streamed down his face where neither expression nor emotion deemed itself courageous enough to show. Sami tried to get his attention, calling out his name, shaking his shoulder, but he looked on. It was as if a half of his heart, long forgotten and stored away, was suddenly let out and wailed in its glorious reverberations, the maddening minuet of its death throes.     
    
  At length, Solus came back to his senses. Sami was there, kneeling next to him, checking him for signs of shock. ‚ÄúYour Majesty, I‚Äî‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúIs what you said true?‚Äù He stared ahead, speaking gravely.     
    
  Sami paused, searching for words of comfort. ‚ÄúI'm sorry.‚Äù     
    
  Solus nodded to himself. ‚ÄúThank you for telling me. There is a room for diplomats in the northwestern tower of the building. You may use that to sleep.‚Äù He took a long drink from his glass. ‚ÄúI need to be by myself for a time.‚Äù     
    
  ‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù Sami stood up, slowly made his way out of the room. He closed the door behind him as gently as he could and walked down the hall toward its end. As he rounded a corridor he heard a soft wail within the walls, growing fiercer by the second until every hall echoed with the cries of a dying heart.",u_ReadsLikeBadFiction,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ReadsLikeBadFiction/comments/pdmwez/angel_of_the_red_sun_chapter_10/,,ReadsLikeBadFiction,pdmwez,/r/u_ReadsLikeBadFiction/comments/pdmwez/angel_of_the_red_sun_chapter_10/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ReadsLikeBadFiction/comments/pdmwez/angel_of_the_red_sun_chapter_10/,0,2021-08-29

Laura and I go on a date.,"Last time, Laura essentially gets gangbanged by my two best friends and some randoms at a house party. I become self aware of the beta that I am around her. After that party I basically accepted my friendzoned position. Laura would still provide the occasional handjob or if I was really lucky a blowjob. But her pussy was forbidden to me. That was for her to give to everyone else, and for me to eternally desire. 

Things began to calm down a little after that night. Laura would continue sleeping around, averaging about one to two new guys every few weeks. By this point Kyle and I had decided to move away to college together. Laura was starting at a university only a couple of hours from home. So we winded down the summer knowing we were going away, not sure the next time we would see each other again. Despite Laura's behavior and her escapades, she really did love me and care for me as a friend. She was as heartbroken as I that we would be so far away from each other. She made a special point to hangout with me more often before I left. Of course we would go watch the stars under that abandoned ranch house, and we had some really great platonic moments. But ultimately, I still desired her, and wanted the one thing she had so consistently refused me. 

My parents left town for a weekend. Laura knew about it and invited herself and Kayla over. She said tonight was all about me, her, and Kayla. We drank, talked, played some video games, joked and had fun. We played some kissing games and she gave me a few lessons. Allowing me to practice on her and Kayla. She told Kayla and I about some of her more recent sexual escapades. Fucking in a movie theater, blowjob on the freeway, public parks, things like that. Nothing to special. Kayla shared some of her stories, but I was the second time she ever had sex apparently, and was far less experienced than Laura. Eventually we all settle in, putting on a movie. All three of us cuddling on the couch and i'm massaging their tits. 

Kayla gets up to use the restroom. Laura pulls me up off the couch, and tells me to lay down on the floor. She says she wants to give me a massage, which she does briefly; before turning me onto my back. Im laying there looking up at her while she straddles me. But by now I've accepted i'll never get to feel her pussy around my cock. We both know this, and she stands up. I have a treat for you. She removes her pants and sits on my chest in her panties. She begins to rub herself against my chest and slowly works her way up to my neck, then my chin, and at long last my nose is pressed right into her panties up against her clit. I can feel her pussy warmth against my lips and she tells me to try her snack. I stick my tongue out and lick her. She tastes amazing, hot, sweaty, and her pheromones are like ecstasy to me. My mind is going crazy. i try to work my tongue around her panties, but with her full weight on my head it was difficult, I was having a hard enough time trying to catch my breath through my nose. I was enjoying it immensely though. All I could think about was how good she tasted and how much I loved her and that I was making her feel good right now. She rode my face for probably 10 minutes. I was relieved when she finally got off of me, because my tongue was incredibly sore by that point and I had to catch my breath. 

We cleaned ourselves up a bit. And she beckoned me back to the couch. It was then I noticed, Kayla had never come back. I asked Laura, but she had only realized it when I prompted her. We searched around the house, but nothing. Kayla had vanished. We walked out front of the house, looking up and down the street. I walk a quarter mile each way, but nothing. Laura says she'll be fine, lets go back to the house and start where we left off. I reluctantly agree, only because I couldn't think of where else to look. We head back to the house and she gives me a blowjob. Swallowing my cum for the first time. It was incredible. About 20 minutes after we had gotten back to the house though. Kayla walks back in. We ask her what happened, and where she went? She said she had the spins and needed to go for a walk to cool herself down. But apparently still had them. Laura pulls my pants down and brings Kayla over. She tells her to poke the penis. They both begin poking and playing with my dick to get Kayla focused onto something other than the room spinning. They continue to play around easily, almost non-sexually. Kayla at times grabs ahold of my dick to stabilize herself while we watch another movie. Laura occasionally leans over and gives my dick a kiss, or a moments suck on my balls. This goes on the rest of the night until we all pass out on the couch. 

The next morning Kayla leaves after breakfast. Laura says she has no plans and would like to go to the river with me today. I ask her if She wanted to take the canoe up the river, which she was very gleeful to hear. I prepare the canoe, fill an ice chest, and we carry it over to the river. There is a summer dam up at this time of year for recreation and swimming, so we put in above it so we can gently paddle around on the summer river lake. Laura is leaning back getting a tan in a beautiful yellow bathing suit. I am standing shirtless in shorts, paddling the canoe. There are plenty of swimmers and people having barbeques along the river. When this one drunk guy starts singing very loudly from shore ""when the moon hits your eyes like a big pizza pie, That's Amore"" Laura sits up and starts giggling. Others from shore join in ""When the world seems to shine, like you've had too much wine, that's amore."" They continue as I paddle past and upstream. Im laughing a little, and Laura is blushing. At this point a group of 15 drunk men are singing this, very loudly so everyone else starts to notice. on the shore. People are laughing and a few other randoms join in. I'm getting quite anxious, I'm enjoying the attention, but I'm not used to it and I just keep paddling and looking at Laura. Then I hear a ""Kiss her!"" from the shore. And shortly after many more people chime in, ""Kiss her!"" Laura blushes more, but beckons me over. I squat down so I don't tip the canoe and lean in to her. She gives me a quick kiss on the lips and sends me back. Some of the guys aren't satisfied with that though, and Laura shouts back that ""We're just friends!"" They laugh and we continue on up the stream.  

We stop up the river about another mile or so and have a picnic, Laura looking sexy as ever, tanning in her yellow bikini. Long blonde hair, C-cup breasts, and a bubble butt that supports her beautiful hourglass figure. I'm in love with her, enjoying what feels like a real date, and quality time with her. Despite having personally witness her suck 2 of my best friends dicks. Watch them fuck her pussy, and their cum leak out of her. I couldn't have been more in love with her. We finish our picnic, pack our trash, and float down the river as the evening light wanes. I tell her that I love her, and she says the same. We have a conversation that goes nowhere about why she won't date me. Regardless I tell her she meant the world to me. We get back to the house, shower together, and allows me to kiss her again. She gives me a handjob and I cum on her thighs. We finish rinsing off. She gets dressed and tells me she's heading out. I thank her for spending the day with me and tell her how much she means to me. She leaves.

Years later I learn that she had come from Kyle's place when she showed up that evening, and drove straight there after our river date. She had fucked him that entire day before making me eat her pussy. I don't remember having tasted anything salty or cum like. But apparently she had at least 3 creampies in her while she was riding my face. And after driving back there, she would tell him how much I loved her as they fucked. Apparently they made a video, but i've never seen it. On it supposedly she's getting pounded doggystyle when he pulls out and she turns around to swallow, begging him for his cum. Asking Kyle to ""feed me."" Laura really did love her cum. And in some sick way I think she really did love me too.",FriendzoneCucks,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendzoneCucks/comments/pdnrd4/laura_and_i_go_on_a_date/,,lostintranslation53,pdnrd4,/r/FriendzoneCucks/comments/pdnrd4/laura_and_i_go_on_a_date/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendzoneCucks/comments/pdnrd4/laura_and_i_go_on_a_date/,0,2021-08-29
My coworker‚Äôs daughter [mf] pt. 3,"Thanks for being patient during the delay, life happens sometimes. I appreciate the comments and messages, I‚Äôm glad others are enjoying hearing some of my unique experiences. I‚Äôve also noticed I get a lot more positive feedback on the buildup and not necessarily the sex itself, so this post is skewed towards the buildup. I always welcome feedback though. 


On to the fun stuff‚Ä¶spoiler alert: we fucked a lot the rest of the summer (and occasionally beyond, but those are another set of stories).


We both wanted to keep fucking, but also wanted to avoid work at (almost) all costs. I had my kids about half the time, so when they were with their mom it was easy to find a time and place, but we didn‚Äôt want to stop fucking the other half of the time. She was spending the summer at her parents so that wasn‚Äôt an option when they were home. We ended up having a lot of fun both teasing each other at work as well as getting creative about how to find alone time.


There was one night we were dirty texting and after a few pics from her it occurred to me that I had never seen her in fancy lingerie. I decided to surprise her and had some really cute stuff shipped to her house. A few days later I got a text thanking me, she was very surprised and also very thankful. She didn‚Äôt want to send any pics that day though..I knew I was in for some fun teasing.


The next day at work was torture. She must‚Äôve looked at my schedule because I was getting pictures of her in the lingerie at the start of every meeting. Some I was away from people so I could take a quick look, others I‚Äôd see a text and knew what it was but had to wait just to be careful. They started out relatively basic but got dirtier as the day went on. She was in the second to last meeting of the day with me and I‚Äôll never forget the texts she sent as soon as I sat down. She had taken a few in the work bathroom. One was her pulling down the pants she was wearing showing me her tight ass in the purple lacy thong that happened to be my personal favorite. The next was her top pulled down slightly to show me that she was wearing the matching purple bra. The last was her in just the lingerie. I was looking at her across the room in conservative work clothes and looking at her on my phone in incredibly sexy lingerie that she took 10 minutes before just for me. I had never been more turned on and never more distracted at work. I got through the meeting without showing my obvious distraction but I practically ran to my office so I could take a closer look at her pics.


As I was looking I got a text from her saying she was free after work. Luckily I didn‚Äôt have my kids that night. We could focus on each other instead of figuring out how to be alone. 


On her way over she texted me that she wanted to show her appreciation for the random gift. I had some ideas of what she meant and knew I was in for a good night, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting her to give me a legit modeling show of all the lingerie I bought her. She brought heals and some fun accessories. I was in heaven, this incredibly sexy teen was happily modeling the sexiest lingerie I could find, I was enjoying some of my favorite bourbon, and I knew I was about to have some mind blowing sex. Between every set she‚Äôd walk over to me naked, kiss me, ask how I liked the prior set, and make sure I was having fun. Towards the end she‚Äôd take my cock out and suck it for a few minutes before going back and trying on the next set. 


The sex that night was incredible. Her teasing was driving me insane. She seemed to get extremely horny from modeling for me. That made both of us even more adventurous than normal. I had a semi-private backyard, but not private enough that there was zero chance of being seen. We were sitting on the edge of my pool with our feet in the water. She got naked and swam across and back a few times, but the last time she swam right up between my legs, slid my shorts off, and started sucking my cock. I think she loved the feeling of it getting hard in her mouth. I started playing with her tits and eventually pulled her up so she was sitting on my lap facing me. I was leaning back halfway and she slid my cock inside her and started riding me. It didn‚Äôt take long for us to realize how uncomfortable it was for both of us but it was still incredibly hot. We moved to one of chairs and she sat on me and rode me like that for a bit. I eventually got up, bent her over the rail that was nearby and fucked her from behind. We were trying to be as quiet as possible but we were not completely successful. 


Having fun outside with a chance of being seen turned us on even more. We had both gotten off while fucking outside, but things just escalated inside. Going down on each other multiple times, cumming in multiple holes and all over her, new positions, fucking in rooms we hadn‚Äôt fucked in yet, etc. It was one of those nights where you get in a zone and you‚Äôre so turned on and there‚Äôs no stopping.


At one point her dad texted her asking if she was ok as I was fucking her. She didn‚Äôt hesitate and responded ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm great dad‚Äù as I was inside his daughter. Minor detail but I found it really hot in the moment. The next day at work he even complained to me that Ali got home really late the night before. I responded with a generic comment about my kids but was just thinking about how he had no idea what the real reason was.",sexstories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/pdy4fz/my_coworkers_daughter_mf_pt_3/,Age Play,brickedup91,pdy4fz,/r/sexstories/comments/pdy4fz/my_coworkers_daughter_mf_pt_3/,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexstories/comments/pdy4fz/my_coworkers_daughter_mf_pt_3/,2,2021-08-29
What denomination or church should my husband and I seek out?,"Hey everyone,

Hope this post is OK. I made a similar post in /r/Christianity and got some useful tips but would like to hear from people of more denominations. 

Background: My husband and I are young married Catholics (early 20s). Or rather, we were both raised Catholic but lost faith in the Church in our teens. Now that we have been married civilly, we are hesitant to go back as the Church doesn't recognize our marriage and we could have to get it 'consolidated', even though we are already married. In addition, we can't explain away the scandals, from sex abuse to the Indigenous unmarked gravesites and the Magdalene laundries. So we have decided to look for a new Church. 

Spirituality: We very much believe in God. We pray often at home to Jesus. My husband is skeptical about saints and miracles, as he feels like anyone could fake one, but this isn't a deal-breaker; he will probably not take well to any denomination or church that has a 'human prophet' post-Jesus like Mormonism, though. 

What we want in a Church: We use birth control. We don't believe in abortion personally, but would not want this to be a hot button issue for the church. We believe in God's love and therefore want a church that is actually accepting of LGBTQ members, even if they are not theologically given a full-on 'marriage' but rather a commitment ceremony or something like that. We are college educated professionals (well, at least my husband is a professional, but we are both 'intellectuals' in the non-pejorative sense) and we would prefer a pastor who has a proper understanding of the Bible in its historical context, and who can explain the Scriptures in a logical and eloquent way. We would not fit into a Church that is anti-science, we believe that climate change is real, vaccines are good, and that evolution actually happened. We are not too into 'exuberant' worship, so no speaking in tongues or shouting or anything too over the top like that - just personal preference. We would also not like a Church where everyone has to stand up and give testimony, or a Church which emphasizes conversion/proselytism. We just want a nice community which believes in Jesus, loves each other as He commanded, and prays for each other. Ideally this community would be young and thriving, and it would be socially acceptable to get married young, as we did. We don't really drink and definitely don't use drugs.

What we can give to our Church: I'm big into volunteering, I used to help teach catechism classes/Sunday school, also volunteered for a hotline and a soup kitchen. So any church with lots of service to the poor and homeless would be good. My husband just wants some male friends with the same values that we have - very 'centrist' politically and not at all 'racist'. We are a mixed-race couple so joining a community with some degree of ethnic cohesion, e.g. Mennonites, would probably not end well. We live in a major East Coast city so will probably be able to find most major denominations.

As Catholics we are somewhat resisting going full-on 'high church' Protestant due to the history of conflict there, especially in Ireland where much of his family is from. Please share something about your denomination and whether we would fit in!",AskAChristian,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAChristian/comments/pe480t/what_denomination_or_church_should_my_husband_and/,Denominations,hausfrau224,pe480t,/r/AskAChristian/comments/pe480t/what_denomination_or_church_should_my_husband_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAChristian/comments/pe480t/what_denomination_or_church_should_my_husband_and/,36,2021-08-29
The Future of Man - A Message from the Great White Brotherhood,"Let me just start of this message by saying that most of you are not going to believe what I'm about to say. That's fine. I'm not trying to convice everybody that what I am saying here is the truth. I'm simply trying to speak to those of you who will listen. Message begins:

 

Message received: 27NOV2020

We wish to say that humanity is moving into a new phase.  
 On one hand, we have the natural progression we call Ascension, and on  the other hand, we have this virus created and released on humanity by  the evil ones.  
 The reason for this is to reduce the world‚Äôs population and also to deny forever the freedoms that all mankind is entitled to.  
 The world will never be the same again.  
 This virus cannot be eliminated.  
 It has been designed with great care so that, in the case of a vaccine being developed, it mutates to a new form.  
 So, this virus will plague humanity forever into the future.

But all is not lost.

The positive effect of Ascension will allow humanity to develop and  change. With the help of the Directors of Life, a new species of man  will be introduced that can cope and resist this virus.  
 In the present time, unfortunately, the weak and infirm will die, thus shortening the life expectancy of humanity.  
 Young people will be encouraged to accept the limitations of freedom  that old people knew. But that generation (the old people) will, to a  great extent, be eliminated by the virus.  
 So, a new way of life will be introduced where individual freedoms will  no longer be accepted and punitive steps taken to put a stop to anyone  who tries to express freedom.  
 The idea is to create a world of slave‚Äôs, accepting without question the limitations put on freedom of expression.

Ascension, in the long term, will put a stop to this folly, but that will be long into the future.  
 In the meantime, more and more restrictions on freedom of movement,  freedom of expression, and liberty will gradually come into place, the  excuse given being that, as this virus mutates, so it affects more and  more people and thus, to prevent the spread of it, loss of liberty must  be introduced, overseen by a universal body who will regularly shutdown  entertainment outside of the house and allow people only to shop using  the internet, and delivery of groceries and goods will be delivered to  the door by special couriers using specially adapted vans equipped with  filters to keep out the virus.

There will be a gradual shutdown of all outdoor activities and anyone found being abroad will be suitably punished.  
 Workers will be forced to find work close to home and will have to wear special clothing as used in hospitals.  
 All homes will be equipped with filter systems providing oxygen, mixed  to produce the same atoms as clean air, which will be delivered to homes  in metal containers rather like oxygen is stored in metal bottles used  in welding plants.  
 Outside air will be kept out of homes.

This system, which seems impossible to produce and introduce now,  will be gladly accepted as more and more people succumb to the virus.  
 Old or inadaptable houses will be demolished and a new style of simple  rectangular block houses will be introduced and people will be forced to  live in them, many people not being allowed to leave them.  
 Everything needed will be delivered by special courier.

Of course, as the places that people normally go to now; the seaside,  parks, restaurants, and so on will be empty of humanity, only a chosen  elite will enjoy these places.  
 These chosen people will have had a vaccine injected in them that will  not be available to the general public, and as the virus mutates, so new  vaccines will be introduced, available only to the chosen few.

This is the fate that awaits humanity from now on and for a long number of years.  
 Eventually, people will revolt and there will be a revolution when the  public realizes the trick that has been played on them, a trick to  enable the elite to appreciate freedom, while the public is locked in  their concrete houses.

We are sorry to announce this, but the public has the right to know.  
 Forewarned is forearmed.

Help with property line potential issue,"Hi All,

I have read quite a few posts about property line disputes on Reddit, and while I am not currently in dispute I am hoping for some advise on next steps to protect myself.

https://imgur.com/a/fjaxVYc

I am hoping the images and text provide context to the situation, I am the home on the left in the images. Also we are in Ontario.

I moved into my house last year and everything is going great. I was looking to do some modeling of the property/house to see how things would look for landscaping and what not. Upon doing so I realized the property line looks to cut off quite a bit of an area which I thought was my property. This area includes a big chunk of the drive way which is used as well to access the garage and the area I walk around the house to access a gate to my backyard. Looking back towards the backyard you can see the fence (which appears to be on the property line) definitely draws a straight line to where it appears the property line is. I guess I thought the line would go to the gate, then change angles so that it doesn't cut off this part of the property.

Looking at historical photos it appears this has been the case since the homes were built in 1965. Additionally, I know for at least the past 10 years (I assume longer) the owner of my home looked after and maintained this area including snow removal and cutting grass. It doesn't appear there are any easements or agreements on title and nothing about this came up during the purchase of the home.

I am very friendly with the neighbors who are a bit older (80's) and while no current issues, I have some concerns about the future and eventual newer owners.

What would the recommendation be in a situation like this? Could I claim possession or implied easement on this land due to the longevity of the situation and the upkeep of the land? Should I approach the neighbors about buying the section to modify the property line/getting an easement or some other instrument? Or ignore and play dumb and challenge if the neighbor (likely future owner, not current) tried to change, build, dispute the land?

Any and all insight would be really appreciated. Please let me know if any other information would be helpful. 

Note: I did get title insurance and whatever other things we were told we should get during purchase is that helps or should be where I look to.",legaladvicecanada,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/pe2hmw/help_with_property_line_potential_issue/,:24px-Flag_of_Ontario:Ontario,moneyquestions91,pe2hmw,/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/pe2hmw/help_with_property_line_potential_issue/,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvicecanada/comments/pe2hmw/help_with_property_line_potential_issue/,8,2021-08-29

Me 16 female
My boyfriend 16
Neice 13
Younger neice 9
Neices mother 29
Older sister that lives with me 29
My mum 48
My dad 50

My neice recently moved into my already crowded house, in my cramped room. She comes from an abusive family where her mother shows obvious favouritism for her younger sister and emotioally abuses her (yells/screams at her, removed her bedroom door, smashed her phone etc.)This is because my neice likes to steal, sneak out (I still think it's wrong for her mother to react this way). She steals her mums pot, her alcohol, money, smokes etc so its only natural her mother would get angry but it's more complicated than that. This was a past thing but when anything goes missing in her house my neice is instantly blamed when she didn't take anything, this causes major arguments between them. Since her mother dosent believe her when she says she didn't take anything she started stealing it again ""I see no point in changing my behaviour if she won't trust me"" which is fair in some weird way. 

Because of this my mother decided it would be best if she lived with us to give her a break. We welcomed her with open arms, because it was a spontaneous thing she had no clothes so I let her wear and borrow mine. After about a week my mum drove us back to my neice mums house to pack her a bag. Despite now having her clothes she would continue to wear mine and when I'd ask her about she would say she didn't have them. Another thing she would do is hide the fact that shes wearing them like one of my favourite shirts I let her wear she would have on under a hoodie to hide it, and when she wasn't wearing it she'd stuff it at the bottom of her bag, I found out because I went through her stuff I know kind of scummy but I wanted my stuff back. I let this slide and didn't say anything else of it.

After maybe 3 weeks she got hmm more comfortable. More stuff was going missing and now not just mine.My sister that lives with us noticed her vape juices and some money went missing, giving her the benefit of the doubt we assumed that they had dropped behind her drawer and that she probably forgot where she put the money. Because of this we started hiding our stuff, thinking back on it we should've confronted her from the start but were nice. I would also like to put out there that I double checked my stuff everyday to make sure nothing was going missing because I was paranoid she was taking my things, this really took a mental toll on me because my stuff wasn't safe in my own home. 

One night I decided to shove my wallet deep down into my bag and double checked how much was in it (70$). when I woke up for school the next morning being the person I am checked through it and found 40$ missing I was beyond pissed. She couldn't have accidentally found it, meaning she went through my bag. I went straight up to her and demanded where my money was, she said she didn't have it. I had a feeling she would try and sneak it back into my wallet so I left it in my pocket. I went through her school bag, her packed bags she was taking to visit her mum in the weekend and I found my jeans, my jewlerry, my sisters eyelash curler and my box cutter I kept in my bag to keep myself safe (again I'm a paranoid person). Eventually I found the money in my purse ya know the place I didn't put it, I told her thanks for putting it back and she still tried to deny it. I didn't go to school that day and we ended up leaving at around 8:40am. After that she didn't come back to stay.

About a month ago my mum decided to try and bring her back again... Why? Because same problems were popping up. She decided to again steal her mother weed so her friend recorded her and showed it to her mum. It started a massive argument the new phone she bought her got smashed yada yada the whole spiel. The thing is despite have proof and video evidence she still denied it. None of us wanted her back we didn't want to have to start hiding away out things again. Now my mom's reasonings were ""shes not in a healthy place mentally, staying in that home with a mother like that will damage her and she may end up committing suicide"" and me being an advocate for mental health understood that she needed to be removed from that environment. 

Right now my mother must sound like a Saint taking in a child from an abused family and yeah that's pretty cool of her but she neglects her own children. She's an alcoholic and drug addict, she refuses to acknowledge it. Her drinking has always been a problem. She drinks at 10am in a weekend or holiday  so it's very difficult to have an honest conversation with her in that state. She smokes weed constantly also. I grew up in a abusive household, my parents would hit me, my siblings, eachother and argue almost every night, and they'd talk mad shit about all of behind thin closed doors just a terrible environment to grow up in. Due to the trauma I find it quite difficult to talk and confide in my mother. So when I heard she was bringing my neice back to our house I went nuts but I couldn't show it because any sign of weakness in our house will not be tolerated. she's also extremely racist, transphobic and homophobic. Her drunken antics have made us loose a lot of money and she also has a massive hoarding problem. My dad's no better very angry and reactive. Both also came from shitty families but they had kids when they weren't mentally ready so... 

After my neice moved in I steddily grew a strong resentment for her. Any small thing she did would just tick me off, unfair I know. She would blast whatever shitty video she was watching, same with movies, TV shows etc this was especially annoying at 1am when I was trying to sleep (BTW there's no school due to covid but I still have a shitton of work). She would take photos of me and my sisters for Snapchat and ones of where my dogs were being dogs e.g licking there genitals. I told her off for that because that's gross. She also likes to tag along with the walks me and my sister would go on, both of us hate our home so this was our own private thing. She also hoardes food in her bed and shoves the rubbish under mine!

Recently I finally had a conversation with my mom

Me: ""my stuff is still going missing, there's no point in asking because she won't own up to it, her being here is seriously making me paranoid I'm not sure how much longer I can handle this""
Mom: ""well what do you expect me to do send her off to go live with some other people""
Me: ""well I don't know, why would you ask me something like that""
Mum: ""I don't want her to end up killing herself because she lived with people that-

I can't remeber much of anything else just feeling angry. My stuffs going missing again, she's wearing my socks and jewelry. I have next to terrible memory so when I've hidden something so well I don't remember I Almsot have a panic attack beucsse of the stress. What's worse is the fact that my mother treats her far better than she treats me. I waited 3 months for her to get her shit together to get a bank account so she could give me money, I had to make the appointment when I had no idea what I was doing. Whereas the second my neice moved in she was made the appointment to get her a card and gives her money for doing ""chores"" (she sleeps all day). Shes huge hypocrite saying my neice mother is terrible but ignores her own abusive behaviour. This is just a big complicated mess and I'm not sure what to do. I feel really selfish for thinking this way but there's no change to her behaviour regardless of the house she's in I think she may have just gotten sneakier.

I'm not sure if there is anywhere else for her to go, her dad's in jail, her grandads house is full. She sneaks out at my nans, her other nan is in hospital its just really complicated. 

What I really want is to move in with my boyfriend but I hate that it's merely out of survival that out of love and want. Of course I wanna stay with him but I don't wanna end up being a burden, plus I want it to be my decision rather that unfortunate circumstances. 

Again I'm battling a lot with my mental health, the trauma, the stress, the anxiety has made me very depressed and possibly suicidal but I can't talk to my mum about this and if I'd try she'd likely shut me down. This has caused my grades to suffer as a result its one big fuck you cycle. I just want to get out of this house as soon as possible. 

Please just be straight up and let me know if I'm jsut be over dramatic and sensitive. I'll try and give as much details as possible if you're confused about something. 


Tldr: my neice is stealing from my me and my family. I now wanna move out and die.",Advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pduijq/i_need_help/,,Walrusboobss,pduijq,/r/Advice/comments/pduijq/i_need_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pduijq/i_need_help/,4,2021-08-29
If you were Tiffany,"Watching this last season of 90 Day was my first introduction to Ronald &amp; Tiffany. For some reason, I have been resisting watching THE OTHER WAY, I don't know why but since it's about to gear back up tonight I thought I should start from the beginning. I am sure the questions I am about to ask have already been hashed out and discussed but literally since this AM, I just started watching TOW from season 1 of it which is where we first meet Ronald &amp; Tiffany. If you were Tiffany and you had Daniel or a young child and you knew what you knew about Ronald, would you feel like you were making the smartest choice for you and your child? To not only marry Ronald but then take Daniel away from everything he knows to South Africa based on a man with a shaky past that really has not a lot of space away from his actual offenses and recovery? I mean he is literally finishing up rehab days before their wedding right? I understand you love who you love, but it's different when you have a child in the picture. And me I feel like even if I did love someone, I don't know if I could GO INTO IT with so many strikes against us already. I could understand going into a relationship that seemed stable and then once we were deep, problems arose and you don't want to give up on someone you love and you stay and are there for them- that's different. I guess I'd almost feel like I love ME too much to settle for too much nonsense no matter how I felt about the dude. So if you were Tiffany, would you be Ok making this choice adding in the fact that when he asked her to marry him they only spent ""vacation time"" together twice and barely anytime in person to get to know the real person day in and day out yet you know what he is like on paper? and that includes robbing his own mother of all her material possessions so when she returns home she has nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. The scene where Daniel says goodbye to his friend Malique has been the ONLY time in this damn show that I've ever shed tears. Because although the scene was producer set up, it was genuine feelings. When the boys were hanging by ea other and Daniel was playing with a piece of Malique's hair, that's what started the tears and then they hugged goodbye.",90DayFiance,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/comments/pe1k8b/if_you_were_tiffany/,Discussion,IhavemyCat,pe1k8b,/r/90DayFiance/comments/pe1k8b/if_you_were_tiffany/,https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayFiance/comments/pe1k8b/if_you_were_tiffany/,16,2021-08-29
Venting after replying to an ignorant driver...,"I posted this reply in the Adelaide forum... I know many of you have heard these arguments from car drivers before... just figured I would vent it out by cross-posting with those who understand... 

Original Post at: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/pdjuix/sneaky\_speed\_camera\_with\_limo\_tint\_all\_round\_and/has6vcv?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/pdjuix/sneaky_speed_camera_with_limo_tint_all_round_and/has6vcv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

*So I said:*

 As a cyclist, who sees it so often, people distracted by their phones whilst driving are a much bigger hazard than someone doing 5 or even ten km's over the posted limit... those few seconds looking at the phone are worse than the few seconds difference that 5km/h can make if someone is paying attention anyway... next are the red light runners,... speeding is low hanging fruit, easy to catch, but not the worst driving issue, but so many do it... so the resources are deployed against speeding... it's an election winner... law &amp; order... 

*Then the reply to me was:*

Not saying you do but riding down the middle of the road at 35 in a 50,60,70km zone is safe when there a bike path and a footpath not 4m away

I‚Äôm legally required to give you 1.5m above 60kph but I‚Äôm not required to overtake you or be very quiet with my gears ( I drive and old land cruiser 40 is right between 3rd and 4th ) Nor am I required to give any thought as to where your going my biggest complaint is that you pay nothing for the road and it‚Äôs us that have to watch for your safety even if you have a dedicated lane for you to ride on you guys always choose to ride on the road and not on the side out in the left tire track so even if I wanted to over take you I can‚Äôt because if the 1.5m rule Keep in mind it wouldn‚Äôt be fair if runners ran 3x3 and were in your way and you paid for the road your lic and took the blame if you run them over cause they did something stupid

*Then I replied:*

 I read your reply, and the don't pay taxes / don't belong on the road diatribe was predictable, and I was not going to reply, but Reddit has some capacity to educate people, so I am going to reply:

1. You declare that your biggest complaint is that 'I pay nothing for the road'... Does the rego for my two cars and motorbike count? Surely, if I leave them at home and ride a bike, I should be entitled to cheaper rego for the cars and bike... like a club rego... just use them on weekends... that would be fair, right?
2. I, and no cyclist I have ever met, would be riding down the middle of the road in traffic unless it was imperative that we had to to try and get across lanes to get into a right turn lane... even then, we have probably thought what other options there might be such as going down to the pedestrian crossing... often, on multi-lane roads, we will wait on the side for a reasonable break in the traffic to make our move - this can be minutes at a time, depending on traffic and lights at various intersections... or even old Toyotas dawdling along and taking up the opportunity to merge into traffic before the next wave surges along...
3. Ah, the 'dedicated lane' argument. You obviously have no experience of riding a bicycle on the road but let me tell you... the dedicated lane is not a magic fix. They are usually where all the crap builds up, including screws that fall of the back of tradie utes (punctures), the rocks, sticks and other rubbish that would mean nothing to a 4WD tyre, but can be dangerous to a bike size tyre... the road surface is usually poorer, there are often cars parked in these lanes, requiring us to merge out into 'your lane' at times, the risk of riding in these lanes is that people do think they can squeeze past you, and push you even further into the gutter and various hazards... It is far safer for a cyclist to own the lane for a few seconds and know the space is safe (esp. when the bike lanes end or at roundabouts etc). and for the driver to predictably know what and where the bike is going to do, than to be wedged or pushed off the road by someone thinking they can bet us to their left hand turn and pull in front of us... Can you not spare a few seconds in you daily drives to make the roads a more harmonious place? to do your part to help that cyclist get home to his family? one red light is going to cost you more time, one roadwork location is going to cost you much more time than the cyclist needs to keep the flow.
4. Riding on the road is a legitimate thing and cyclist have as much right to be there as any car, truck or bus... whether you think they don't belong or not is moot - you recognise the legal requirement to give the passing clearance, so you need to just accept that it is a legal requirement to treat all legitimate road users with the same courtesy and that cyclists have an equal right to be on the roads.
5. As for riding on the footpath - that is a ridiculous suggestion... for too many reasons that I will not bother to type out... We may not be able to go as fast as cars, but any cyclist who want to get home uninjured will not be riding in traffic unless it can't be avoided... we can average 20 or 30km/h if we flow in and out of the lanes as required... just like you may change lanes because you see a bus ahead and know it will be stopping and you will get caught behind it...
6. I ride on bike paths where they are available... and I do get the people walking 4 abreast, the two mums with prams side by side, the dog owners letting their mutts on a leash span the entire path... it is frustration... it makes me both aware of how frustrating it can be for drivers (and being one myself helps) when cyclist do unpredictable things, and it also teaches me that we all need to just get along, accept other people are not paying attention to anyone but themselves... or their phones... and learn some tolerance... bike paths can be such frustrating places because of dog owners... or drivers on foot who just can't remember to keep left on them... I bet they wouldn't drive down the middle of the road, or on the wrong side because the view was better on that side...
7. Finally, almost all adult riders are also car drivers too... so we are extra aware of the issues, from both sides of the situation... we know how vulnerable we are, we know that we have to assert ourselves on the road from time to time because drivers will not give way (let alone those who deliberately hate on cyclists) - I can tell that you have only a one-sided view of cyclists, based on your lack of experience of actually being one on the road... I hoe you can consider the points I have made above and change your thinking and attitude... I believe that every person should have to spend a minimum number of hours riding a bike or motorbike before they get their licence, just to know firsthand how vulnerable those legitimate road users are, what the road conditions can be like...

Before you come back with the usual retort about cyclist who run red lights or such, sure, they are the tiny minority, and other cyclists hate them more than car drivers because they give the rest of us a bad reputation... often, they will get a Darwin award and a visit to the ER for their trouble... I could also counter (as both a cyclist and card driver, the idiots in cars who run reds, or take precious green arrow time from me by turning in front of me once their arrow has gone red...

No-one is perfect, we all make mistakes, and we all need to have more tolerance - however, cyclist make more allowances for drivers and their pushy, badly considered or ignorant actions out of self-preservation than cars seem to do for cyclists on average... a car driver may get a scratch on the door trying to assert their 'rights' on the road, a cyclist will get the wheel chair or the casket... we cyclist know what we are up against... but we still do it anyway... no-one should feel bullied so badly that they give up what they love doing...

If the cyclist you passed a minute ago rolls by you whilst you are stuck in traffic, don't be hating on them... be thinking about all the other cars that are in your way... they are the ones making you mad, but you are just taking it out on the ones who can't easily fight back... that is a bully... pick on the weak one in the bunch, and then try and justify yourself by claiming that they looked at you the wrong way or something... All we need is for drivers to behave predictably, with consideration and with respect that we are legitimate road users who have chosen to leave our cars at home - thereby giving you even more space on the roads to assert your self in your metal cage... be thankful we are not in or dual-cab utes taking up more space on the (your) roads... A smile and a wave, and a few seconds of your day is always better than a court appearance and a lifetime of regret...

Enjoy your day, stay safe out there... us cyclists will try to be safe too, but it requires everyone to make the small effort... to get behind the wheel / handlebars with the right attitude...",ausbike,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausbike/comments/pe4gas/venting_after_replying_to_an_ignorant_driver/,Opinion,KovinKing,pe4gas,/r/ausbike/comments/pe4gas/venting_after_replying_to_an_ignorant_driver/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausbike/comments/pe4gas/venting_after_replying_to_an_ignorant_driver/,11,2021-08-29
My bestfriend isn't talking to me and blocked me everywhere.,"Hello everyone. So basically me and my bestfriend have been best friends for 6 years. Initially I was a depressed and low motivated person,she would help me during my exams but she is kinda selfish. She helps me only after she's done her work. We became best friends very quickly,I share everything with her but she doesn't. I call her and speak for hours,but she doesn't really call me (sometimes very rare) She is a very private person. So after 4 years in our home country,we came to a different country for our higher studies, we are now roommates. We never really had any friends, we always hang out together. So we made really good friends here. Later, I got a boyfriend and I became distant with all my friends except her. But my relationship with my boyfriend was really going well. So my best friend ,she only studies a bit better than me except that she copies everything from me like my usage of words, my accent, my makeup ,my clothes etc. And basically she got a boyfriend after I got one after a couple of months. I share with her everything about my boyfriend like the our fights,our talks, first moves and all. She doesn't really share anything. I feel like she doesn't respect me,she basically goes out of the house saying I am going out and never tells me where she has been. We fought a lot ,I say a lot of mean things to her when we fight but she doesn't really reply back to me I don't know what goes on in her head. So on the last day we fought really bad and she left the house with her boyfriend and we didn't speak after that. After 2 months I heard that she got a job in a very big company. I was depressed, I have no friends so I couldn't talk to anyone. I have only my boyfriend, I share everything with him. So after 3 months , I fought with my boyfriend and I called her crying(caller her first time after the fight). We spoke for a long time. She said she is living with her boyfriend and would be leaving to a different location for her job in a few weeks. I really liked speaking to her and so I was happy. After a week, I told her let's go on a trip,she said okay. I was planning everything. She suddenly said I won't be coming because she has other plans, then I asked her maybe we can go other week. She said she has other plans too. I said if you really didn't wish to come ,you should have told earlier ,why are you doing all this. She said nothing like that. That's all, after that she didn't message me. After a week, I called her continuosly, she messaged me saying she was outside. So I called her again this time,she picked the call. I said why aren't you picking the call if someone is calling you so many times. she said ""why are you screaming at me"",my reply was ""why are you even screaming at me,are you doing this because you got a job at a very big company"". she said ""yeah yeah you think like that"" and hung up the call(she never screams at me nor hangs up the call(I always do that)). I messaged her Don't ever contact me and blocked her in whatsapp. she blocked me too. I unblocked her immediately and tried calling her after2 days. (I saw that she has blocked me in all social media.)She messaged me saying ""I am not your family to bear whatever words you say.Don't ever contact me again""but I never spoke rudely to her, I just tell her how disappointed I am that she always ignores me when I always prioritize her even over my boyfriend and we never really fought during those 2 weeks I mean when I fought with my boyfriend and called her,we spoke for 2 weeks and she is suddenly behaving this way ). But I really like speaking to her.she lifts my mood, my other friends say that she waited for the opportunities,now that she got one she left you. I dont want to believe  them.

Indian absconding in the US : whom to contact to deport him for pending trial?,"Non resident indian (NRI) working at a company in the US has possibly fled back to the US after being booked for rape back home in India. As he is absconding to evade arrest the criminal proceedings are pending. He is on work permit and has no greencard yet.

I know his company, his office location and his role, even the names of his colleagues, but on contacting his company's legal department, they are refusing to inform whether he has reported to work online. They said they are open to being the point of contact for legal requests and court orders. However, getting a confirmation that he is reporting to work online to prove that he is absconding to evade legal action is the only way I can get the court to order impoundment of his passport.

At this point, (1) how can I get his company to take some action against him? (2) What is the proper office to contact? USCIS/Consulate General of India/American Consulate? Are there any bodies or contacts I should reach out to? (3) How can I make sure he returns to India for the trial that is pending because of him?

"An analysis of Shoka Sakurane by a Ph.D. student in psychology (yep, that's me)","Hi again! I'm the one who did the Wicked Twisters analyses ([Fret](https://www.reddit.com/r/TWEWY/comments/p6df5p/an_analysis_of_frets_character_by_a_psychology/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [Nagi](https://www.reddit.com/r/TWEWY/comments/p89hu9/examining_nagis_character_and_nagi_headcanons_by/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), [Rindo](https://www.reddit.com/r/TWEWY/comments/p9m8z2/an_analysis_of_rindos_character_by_a_psychology/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)). Today, by popular demand, I'll be analyzing Shoka! Also shoutout to iroishiro for an amazing analysis of [Shiba](https://www.reddit.com/r/TWEWY/comments/pchc26/spoilers_an_analysis_on_shiba_miyakaze/)!

The focus of my analysis is to review Shoka's backstory, her part in NEO TWEWY, her relationships with other characters, and her psychological reactions to the events she witnessed. I will be analyzing her through a psychological lens, and specifically, her thoughts/emotions/behavior. After reading through her character, I noticed Shoka was exhibiting signs of sub-clinical depression or dysthymia, which is a milder form of major depressive disorder (MDD). 

*Disclaimer here: my goal here is not to diagnose, but to go through traits of dysthymia and explain how Shoka reacted to her experiences in a way that mirrors someone who ends up developing dysthymia. I just want to make sure my intent is clear here: I am using my knowledge of psychopathology and cognitive/social psychology to analyze Shoka rather than just slapping a diagnosis on her. It will make sense as I go along.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Backstory**

Years before NEO TWEWY took place, Shoka was a participant in a Reaper's game in Shinjuku. When she won her game, she was offered the choice to go back to the RG or become a Reaper. She decided to become a Reaper, thus continuing to use the powers she had as a Player. When she became a Reaper, she was introduced to the other Shinjuku reapers, with whom she had a strong connection. Her closest connection was with another reaper called Ayano. Ayano took Shoka under her wing and taught her everything she needed to know about being a Reaper. Shoka even likened their relationship to an older sister/younger sister relationship when Rindo asks her about it. She said Ayano was the person she was closest to and Ayano was the nicest towards her, always having her back. When Shoka had problems, she went straight to her, because Ayano could fix them. She said she was special to Ayano too. Rindo asks her if they helped each other out, to which she responded they did and were happy about it. Rindo goes forward in time to ask more questions, and when asking her whether Ayano did something to Shiba, Shoka responds that Ayano was protecting her against Shiba. Shoka also said that once they lost their home, the Shinjuku reapers had to relocate to Shibuya due to Shiba's command, without a choice. Shoka said she grew accustomed to being in Shibuya, but Ayano took it much harder. Ayano missed Shinjuku and her friends and struggled to adjust. On the other hand, Shoka was able to adjust once she got to know the city, which led her to Gatto Nero. 

An interesting moment in the flashback to their early relationship is this line from Shoka: ""I dunno if I can do this. I'm still learning the ropes here and I'm barely hanging on. Don't leave me, okay?"" Ayano is silent, but later in the flashback when Shoka thanks her, Ayano is seen taken aback and blushing. It's obvious the two built a very strong bond over time, with Ayano as Shoka's mentor. Later in the flashback, we can see Shiba taking his place as the new conductor of Shinjuku. Shoka seems excited about the new Game, saying it will be a ""wild ride."" Ayano hopes it will be safe for Shoka, which makes Shiba promise her nothing will happen to Shoka. We can then see another flashback where Shoka is worried about Tsugumi and wondered why she was so sullen. She also showed concern over Shiba suddenly vowing for the destruction of Shinjuku when she thought he loved it there. This is where Kubo started controlling the Shinjuku reapers, giving Shiba powers that turned him corrupt and stripping Tsugumi of her soul. Ayano promises Shoka that she will be safe with her. The bond is obvious, especially knowing Ayano named her iguana after Shoka!

However, Shoka stated that while at first she was excited at being a Reaper (hence the ""wild ride"" comment), she eventually grew bored of it. She didn't care about going up the hierarchy, rather preferring to spend time on the streets and messing with Players. During her time as a Reaper, she finds a way to escape from this distressing situation through a game: FanGo. Soon, she finds a friend in Rindo. Her connection to Rindo is a way for her to escape from her Reaper friends either turning evil, becoming distant, or losing their identity. As she sees her former friends turn away from her, she finds comfort in communicating with Rindo. She also has Ayano by her side, but Ayano starts becoming more possessive and controlling of Shoka as Ayano's own friends become distant from her as well, so she latches on to Shoka as the only person she still has and begins to depend on her. These two points will be examined more in detail later on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Psychological analysis**

This is where that sense of depression came into being. Imagine seeing your boss blow up a city you grew up in, seeing one of your friends become soulless, watching as your fellow Reapers (who are your friends) create a rigged game where they become fake Players and declare themselves winners every week, and being complicit in the deaths of many Players by convincing them there's a way to win only to have them lose and get erased. Of course she would start to lose faith in being a Reaper. Soon, we start to see a sense of boredom, apathy, and lack of interest in previously enjoyable activities. She even starts believing she would be fine with getting erased. She just goes along with what she has without caring much about her job or future.  She starts feeling alone, as all of her friends either went crazy or became distant. This makes her frustrated, which she directs towards the Players as a form of lashing out. In addition, she starts noticing Ayano's possessiveness, which culminates in an event that happens in NEO that will be addressed in the next section.

Loss of interest in daily activities (e.g.: Reaper duties), emptiness (e.g.: feeling bored), feeling down (e.g.: being unhappy at her friends turning away from her or her job of sending Players to their death), hopelessness (e.g.: feeling the Reaper game is pointless), lack of energy (e.g.: not bothering climbing in rank), irritability (e.g.: lashing out at Players), decreased activity and productivity (e.g.: shirking from high-effort Reaper duties), feelings of low belongingness (e.g.: not belonging among the Reapers as they changed drastically), and not caring about life (e.g.: not minding being erased)... these are not necessarily enough to qualify as major depressive disorder (MDD). These are rather mild symptoms, but still debilitating. And they hint at something less severe, but still distressing: dysthymia or persistent depressive disorder. A low state of mood that persists and lasts for a long time, unlike MDD which has depressive episodes that last several months and are interspersed with normal mood.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Persistent depressive disorder, also called dysthymia (dis-THIE-me-uh), is a continuous long-term (chronic) form of depression. You may lose interest in normal daily activities, feel hopeless, lack productivity, and have low self-esteem and an overall feeling of inadequacy. These feelings last for years and may significantly interfere with your relationships, school, work and daily activities. If you have persistent depressive disorder, you may find it hard to be upbeat even on happy occasions ‚Äî you may be described as having a gloomy personality, constantly complaining or incapable of having fun. Though persistent depressive disorder is not as severe as major depression, your current depressed mood may be mild, moderate or severe.

&amp;#x200B;

Sound familiar? These symptoms bleed into the events of NEO TWEWY, which will be addressed next!

&amp;#x200B;

**NEO TWEWY**

At the start of the game, Shoka serves as a guide to the Wicked Twisters. She is snarky and mocking as she interacts with them, which gets on their nerves (especially Rindo). However, she is secretly trying to help them. She tries to give them information about the Game and sends them hints throughout the Game. Why? As mentioned, she was bored of the Reaper's Game because it was always the same outcome (hence her sense of helplessness), so she wanted to spice it up and make it more interesting. That's why she tried to help the Wicked Twisters so that they could pull an upset. Also, since she was Swallow (Rindo's friend), she also secretly wanted to help him. But she was not able to tell Rindo about her identity: as long as she was a Reaper, her goal was to antagonize players, so she had to be standoffish towards him as a result. This obviously hurt her, since having to oppose your friend and lead him to his potential death is very distressing, which added to her low mood. She started to feel hopeless towards Rindo as well because she knew he was never going to win the Game and she couldn't let him know about her identity. He was very hostile towards her throughout the game until later due to thinking she was the enemy. Shoka had to deal with her friend hating her, which added to her low self-esteem (thinking not even her friend would like and accept her). She knew if she was openly kind to Rindo, the Reapers would notice and immediately punish her. She continues to respond to Rindo through Swallow, and since she was scared he would find out about her identity, she had to be subtle and not give hints. This sense of secrecy gnawed at her, adding to her distress.

Later in Week 2, Motoi confronts Shoka and exposes her for betraying the Reapers through her help to the Wicked Twisters, hoping this would help him become a Reaper. Obviously, this backfired on him, but the Reapers saw Shoka's betrayal and fired her, demoting her to a Player. She struggled with fending off Noise until the Wicked Twisters saved her. At first, she seemed taken aback by their help, but eventually agreed to join them. This hesitance stemmed from being used to her friends leaving her, so she struggled with trusting others. Looking at Shoka's character, it seems that she was used to being alone. Ayano was the only one who cared about her, but eventually, she became possessive and... well, we'll get to that later. There are two aspects to depression: low belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. First, Shoka felt like she didn't belong with the Reapers, as they all turned their backs on her twice: when they initially became hostile and later when they fired her. Second, she felt like a burden since she felt that no one truly liked her. A cause of dysthymia is experiencing stressful and traumatic events, like the loss of loved ones. Specifically, the feeling of not being loved and being alone coupled with the fact that she had to see her friends cut off ties with her added to her distress. Not to mention witnessing so many people die at the hands of you and your colleagues. Later, she would lose even more loved ones, but we'll get to that. This is why she relied so much on Ayano, the only person she had. However, with her betrayal of the Reapers, she also technically betrayed Ayano, meaning she would have to lose her. The final straw was when Shiba announced that Shoka originally wanted to spy on the Wicked Twisters to tell the Reapers about Rindo's Replay ability. Rindo felt betrayed, but Shoka turned on Shiba and said she wouldn't let them destroy Shibuya. This ties into her connection with Shibuya. After being a reaper in Shibuya, she slowly started getting accustomed to the city. But when she found Gatto Nero, her favorite brand of clothes, she became attached. It is very obvious at this point that once Shoka turned on the Reapers and helped the Wicked Twisters save Shibuya, she started truly feeling a sense of belonging in this city. Later, as she formed more bonds (especially with Rindo), she started feeling less like a burden as people started to like her and care about her. This allowed her to ease off the depressive symptoms as the game went on.

This leads to the part where Ayano tells Shoka she is infected by Plague noise in Week 3. Shoka is obviously worried and tries to save Ayano, trying to convince Ayano to leave the Reapers and join her. However, Ayano was too far gone. Nagi dives into Ayano's mind, where Ayano admits she was mad at Shiba for destroying Shinjuku and wanted him to pay for his actions. It turns out that Ayano willingly let herself be infected by Noise to manipulate Shoka into joining her and the Reapers again. This hints at Ayano being extremely possessive of Shoka and is confirmed by her begging Shoka to stay with her. Her intent is clear here: Shoka is a child that doesn't know what she is doing, therefore she needs to be coddled. Shoka struggles to fight back, which is why Rindo has to go back in time to convince her to fight Ayano. Here she has to witness someone she cared about deeply leaving her, and she had to literally fight her to the death. While Shoka wasn't as dependent on Ayano as Ayano was on her, she still looked up to Ayano as the person who would help her every time she struggled. Now that Ayano is gone, she felt alone again. She had to witness yet another person she loved disappear and leave her. This explains her loss of interest in living and doing her duties: if no one is there to love her and care for her, why does she have to live? Who is she living for? What is the point of her being in this world if no one wants her here? Hence why she is okay with being erased: she doesn't have anything to live for anymore. The Japanese version is also a lot blunter in suggesting Shoka was depressed and borderline suicidal.

Interesting fact from the TWEWY wiki:

&gt;Ayano (Ëèñ‰πÉ) is from iris flower and the archaic possessive particle ‰πÉ (written as „ÅÆ in modern Japanese), possibly hinting towards her possessiveness of Shoka.

Even the Japanese name supports the idea that Ayano was possessive of Shoka.

Later in Week 3, Shoka has to fight yet another friend of hers (Susukichi), then a boss she had respect for (Shiba). One by one, she had to fight people she cared about and turned cold on her, as well as see them die in front of her. If she were dealing with this on her own, this would aggravate her depressive symptoms and cause her to truly give up on life. However, she was lucky to have Rindo and the Wicked Twisters by her side to pick her up and support her. Nagi especially tried to cheer her up and recommended EleStra as a coping strategy. Shoka felt Nagi was helpful, so she became more open to cherishing friendships. And of course, over the course of the game, she began having a closer relationship with Rindo. She had to hide the truth from him until the very bitter end, but as they drew closer, you could see Shoka starting to genuinely feel bad that Rindo had to be in a life-or-death situation, causing her to support him in any way she could. In a scene where Rindo felt betrayed that Motoi was a scam, Shoka looked down in sadness. She was the one who wrote An0ther quotes as Swallow to cheer Rindo up all these years. And as she was erased before Rindo went back in time, she finally revealed her identity to him. It took for her to die to reveal herself, meaning she kept the secret deep within her all this time and only let him know once she thought she would die. Here we can see her truly wanting to live. She went from not caring about being erased to wanting to stay alive just so that she could play FanGo with her friend Rindo. She finally had a reason to live: her friends, and her new city. And once Rindo brings back Shibuya and saves his friends, she finally has a life worth living. That is, until Shiba reveals that she has to be erased due to being demoted as a player. Joshua shows up and saves her, though he obviously had to make her hide from Rindo (silly Josh), but eventually, Rindo and Shoka meet again and become friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

In a nutshell, while the events that Shoka experienced led to her having a persistent down mood (whether you want to call this dysthymia or not), her being able to form bonds with her friends and truly cherish her new city helped her find a purpose in life. Treatment for dysthymia includes finding people to share your thoughts and feelings in a healthy way and having a positive support system, which Shoka found by the end of the game. Having people who care for you, having a reason to live, and finding new passions (e.g.: Gatto Nero or playing FanGo with Rindo) helped Shoka get out of that depressive state and truly enjoy life.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

* **Baghdad**

By the time we showed up in Baghdad, for the most part, the fighting was done.  3ID had rolled through and secured the Airport, which left us to beat our feet in the streets, and alleyways.  Due to the nature of the fighting that 3ID and the Marines  had been up against prior to our arrival it was thought that we may run into enemy armor, thus we were provided with an Abrams, how cool!  I had never been around tanks prior to this day and was super excited.  We patrolled while the Abrams was between our two columns.  My squad leader told me to take my machine gun across the street and in ignorance I cut directly across the ass end of the Abrams instantly burning myself on the exhaust.  I was unaware that the Abrams had a jet engine in it.  My squad leader laughed at my ignorance, I however, was not amused.     The only armor we would run into would be an operational yet abandoned Soviet T-72 tank that was hidden between 2 residential buildings.  Two schools of thought became immediately apparent as to how our senior leadership worked.  A portion of our leadership wanted someone to climb into the tank and investigate it, this was struck down because of booby traps we had found earlier during the invasion.  Another portion of leadership wanted to blow the tank up in place.  Mind you not even 50 feet away from this   tank were women and children in their front yard watching us.  Had we blown the tank in place, it would have leveled the two buildings killing the occupants.  Eventually this idea was struck down as well and the  tank commander of the Abrams informed our leadership that they would stay behind with the T-72 while we advanced  to ensure it was moved away from the residential area before being disposed of to avoid unnecessary civilian casualties.  

We would end the day setting up a patrol base in yet another abandoned school.  From here we would push out patrols as individual squads and platoons for the next few days.  I remember SSG wwwdotogpimpin leading us through streets littered with unexploded cluster bomb munitions, telling us don‚Äôt touch anything.  I remember splashing through horrid smelling drainage water trying my best  to avoid any unforgiving large puddles of excrement.  Another platoon would come back from patrol, the soldiers would excitedly tell everyone how they walked up on a bank being looted and engaged the looters in a brief, yet intense firefight.  Within seconds of the conclusion of the firefight and with gunpowder still lingering in the air a  woman dressed in full burka brought out her child to the soldiers.  Her child couldn‚Äôt  have been older than 10 and was all dolled up in makeup.  ‚ÄúMarry my daughter and take her home with you to America!‚Äù  The mother pleaded.  The soldiers said this in a humorous chuckle.

Without a doubt the children were the most entertaining aspect of this school.   We had set up a restroom area in the backyard.  Kids would climb up to the back of the wall and watch us poop and pee.  No amount of shooing them away would work.  In this war torn hellscape, we were the entertainment.  They would make comments and whistle at us, laughing as our MRE logs would be strained from our bowels.  Some of the better English speakers of the group would mock us about using toilet paper to wipe our stink eyes.  Eventually, Soldiers would toss them skittles, M&amp;M‚Äôs and other tidbits of MRE goodness, which of course brought more kids.  This led to employment opportunities for some of the more teenaged entrepreneurial children of the group to find us cigarettes, candy and other vices.  Lil Hand was one child in particular who would stick out.  He only had one arm, but he had both hands.  His left hand was small and malformed extending from the socket of his shoulder where his missing arm should have been.   Our silly American brains immediately looked at him with pity.  Instinctively giving him preferential treatment.  Pity would eventually turn to horror due to a trade over cigarettes going sideways between him and one of the soldiers. He brought us smokes filled with human hair, at least that's what I thought it was.  It was decided to use another kid to find us nicotine. The child brought back cowboy killers of a much higher quality, so we tossed him the goodies promised.  LIl Hand snatched the treats out of the air.  The other child began to protest, without warning LIl Hand grabbed the other child by the throat with his malformed hand and began punching the child in the face with his other hand.   Someone yelled  hey Lil Hand, knock  it off!  He ignored the command and continued to dominate the child into submission, intimidating the other kids around him.  He checked the other kids and they refused to deal with us soldiers directly from that moment going on. On the handful of occasions afterwards that one tried, LIl Hand would take the child's reward by force.  We had no choice but to give him a 2nd chance and he made sure his new runner children only got us premium brands like Davidoff, Marlboro, or Miami‚Äôs.  When we left the sector we all said farewell to the children and we all told Lil Hand to find out where the Americans base was located and try to find work.  He excitedly waved farewell to us by raising his shoulder and moving his malformed hand back and forth. 

Eventually we would rotate into our battalion TOC, stationed at another school. We would be tasked with cleaning the place, pulling security  and unloading a massive weapons cache of mostly mortar rounds.  Everyone lower than the rank of E-7 would form a line like a chain gang.  We would hand each other mortar after mortar smoking cigarettes, laughing, and joking.  Occasionally someone would drop one of the mortar rounds on the ground.  This would immediately be met with universal silence as if being quiet would not have the mortar round explode sending all of us immediately to our god of choice.  The tension would be broken by someone laughing or making a joke about another's mother.  The mortar rounds were Russian.  Most of the rounds were HE, a few were smoke, but some were made of glass and you could see green and sometimes orange liquid sloshing around inside of them.  I prayed no one dropped any of those glass ones or that none were leaking, I don‚Äôt read Cyrillic so I have no idea what was inside of them, but I assumed it wasn‚Äôt anything I wanted to either touch or breathe.  We filled about 9 LMTV‚Äôs with mortar rounds before the battalion area was finally cleared of it‚Äôs weapon cache.   The final day we were at battalion I would be promoted from an E-2 to E-4, by passing E-3 due to my red flag status being removed.  I didn‚Äôt recall gaining any more immediate responsibility, but what I did gain was a huge bump in pay. 

We would load up on Deuce and ¬Ω‚Äôs  and take a trip to the Baghdad international airport, from there we would load into CH-47‚Äôs Chinooks and fly to Mosul.

My dad and I basically disowned my younger sister due to her mom's behavior towards us.,"A little background, my dad dump the baby momma when I was 18. A few months later she came back saying she was pregnant and it was my dad's. I dad suggested an abortion but she said no, so he made a promise to be in my sister's life. (He did this because he regretted the fact that he was not always there in my life.)

When I was 19 my baby sister was born, my dad was always buying thing to make life easier for the baby momma. He would come visit them, bring my sister toys, and often bring me with him. He was try to make sure she had a better life than he did. This became difficult due to the baby momma getting into fight with my dad and banning both of us from seeing her.

The baby momma was often hostile to my dad because he didn't want to have a relationship with her. She would keep us from see her, and call the cops on my dad when he had her. The most recent thing she been doing is having my now 5 year old sister cursing us out on the phone. 

My dad's job had him move to the next state over, so instead of being a block away he is a hour drive away. Normally I would pick up my sister and drive her over to see our dad. But recently I injured my leg and can not drive. So he has been asking (begging) her mom to either bring her over to see him or drop her off half way to him.

Her mother would always find an excuse or would tell me that my sister wasn't at home. The finale straw was yesterday when my brother agreed to take me to see my dad so I asked to pick up my sister. When I got there she cursed me out saying I didn't tell her earlier and my sister was at her gramother's house. One I called her a week ago. Two as me and my brother were leaving my brother nudge me and pointed to the second floor window. Where my sister was looking out the window at me, she then stuck her middle finger up at me.

I called my father and he called the baby momma  with me on the other line. When my father asked what happened she lied and said my sister was in the hospital that why she wasn't there. My dad was tired of everything began yelling, he said that enough don't contact me, my daughter, or my family anymore.

Why the Last of Us 2 ending is meaningful and a direct continuation of the first game,"# SPOILER WARNING!!!
# Introduction

For many this is sounds like a bold claim but I will try to justify my claims as best I can. First I would like to explore what the first game is about (especially the ending) after which I will explore the meaning of the second game. Then I will explain why, to me, the second games has a very meaningful ending which beautifully completes the events that happened at the Salt Lake Hospital.

**TL;DR at the bottom**, please also read the section **5 Forgiving Joel and moving on** if you have the patience.

# 1 What is the first game about?

At the beginning of TLOU 1 we find Ellie, a young, broken girl who has lost almost everything and everyone she held dear. But she still continues to fight because ***'No matter what you keep finding something to fight for'***. For Ellie right now this is her immunity. Her life means something because she could be the key to saving humanity and it would make Riley's death have meaning. So Ellie, even though she is completely lost, still has **meaning**.

Now Joel and Tess arrive and Ellie starts to trust them. After Tess dies Joel dedicates his life to taking Ellie to the Fireflies and their purposes in life become intertwined. **Joel has now found meaning again**.

When they finally arrive at the hospital and Joel learns the truth about what will happen to Ellie he makes the choice to save her. However, by saving Ellie she takes away her meaning (but he gives her a life and a new meaning, one that Ellie won't see or accept yet) which is why Ellie is so devastated after waking up in the truck. 

# 2 Events between the games

During TLOU 2 we get several flashbacks to Ellie and Joel. While most of them have a tender and heartwarming tone they're filled with suspicion by Ellie. She knows Joel is lying to her but she feels conflicted about this because why would Joel do that? After all, it was Joel that fought to get her there in the first place.

When Joel finally confesses to Ellie about what happened Ellies world shatters. Imagine the feel of betrayal she now feels. Her meaning was taken away from her by the only person who made that possible in the first place, Joel. Ellie now knows the sacrifices that Joel made for her and for what? To save 1 life? **What is 1 life worth compared to potential millions of lives saved?** Ellie can't accept that she is alive but there is no cure because that's not what was supposed to happen. And because Ellie can't accept that **her life is without meaning** because she is stuck with the past.

# 3 Finding meaning once again

The next few years Ellie will struggle with finding meaning. However, during the night that Dina kissed her she finally realises how she can do that; **by forgiving Joel**. By forgiving Joel he would finally accept her own life. And by forgiving Joel, his terrible actions to save her **would have meaning**.

The tragedy of the second game is not Joel's death. People can live happy lives even if they lose loved ones. The tragedy is that finally when Ellie knows what she has to do that chance is taken away from her by Abby. Had Abby found Joel 2 months later the game would not have happened (although if Abby had found Joel before Ellies last conversation with Joel and I think Ellie's life would have been completely doomed).

What does Ellie feel now? Well, the obvious guess is hatred for Abby but even more so she feels guilt for not forgiving Joel and I think deep down she hates herself for that as well. And I think that the reason for Ellies revenge spree is the guilt and her dissapointed in herself and not her hatred of Abby. But she does not realise that because her judgement is clouded by the overwhelming amount of pain she is feeling.

# 4 Ellies revenge

Throughout Ellies revenge spree she starts to notice that even when she kills the people responsible for Joel's death she does not feel better. In fact the feels worse. The cruel things she does **make her lose her humanity bit by bit and therefore she is wasting her life and Joel's massive sacrifice to save her**. Even after the confrontation with Abby and their return home Ellie still can't live her life. The guilt for Joel is still too strong and she makes the mistake to go hunt for revenge once again.

# 5 Forgiving Joel and moving on

Again, Ellie is on the hunt for revenge and nothing is stopping her. She marches through the hunter base with no problem killing dozens in the process but when she finds Abby she can't kill her. Why is that? She just murdered dozens, why would taking 1 more life be a problem for her? At this point the players should realize that it's not killing Abby that is a problem for Ellie. The problem is something much more deeper than that.

**Ellie wasn't looking for revenge; she was looking for a way to forgive Joel**. She finally realises that when she has Abby pinned down underwater . Revenge has only killed her bit by bit and her conscience is already a heavy burden. The final blow to Abby would also be the final blow for Ellie. **By killing Abby, Ellie would kill the last thing that's left of her and therefore the last thing that's left of Joel**. 

In Ellies mind killing Abby would kill ***The Last of Us***.

Ellie makes the difficult decision to forgive Joel and more so, she honors his wish (Joel's wish for Ellie to live a life) by letting Abby go. Ellie still hates Abby with all her heart but she loves Joel more, so she can't kill Abby.


# 6 A meaningful ending

The game ends with Ellie finally accepting and forgiving what Joel did. We see her return for her guitar at the farm which Joel gave her (and note that she has most certainly visited Dina in Jackson before this because of e.g. her wristband on the right arm which she did not have on her when hunting for Abby and she is not at all surprised or worried about Dina, the scene is about Joel and Ellie only). She already forgave Joel when fighting Abby but now she is saying goodbye to him. Ellie has now moved on from the events at the Salt Lake Hospital and Joel's death.

After Ellie walks out we get the most happy ending you could possibly expect from this game. Ellie has accepted her new life and forgiven Joel. She can now go find happiness and now Joel will have finally succeeded in saving her.


# TL;DR

- First game:
  - Ellie finds meaning in her life through her immunity. Joel takes that away but gives Ellie a new life, one that Ellie cannot yet appreciate.

- Second game:
  - Ellie feels like her life has no meaning. After Joel dies, her only way to find meaning (by forgiving Joel and accepting that she is alive but there is no cure) is gone. She goes on a revenge spree and loses almost every last bit of humanity (and life) she has left.

- Meaningful ending:
  - Ellie does not kill Abby because she finally found a way to forgive Joel and accept what he did. Now Ellie can finally start living the life that Joel sacrificed so much for to save.
- Direct continuation to first game:
  - In the ending of the first game Joel saves Ellie but as long as Ellie does not accept that, her life means nothing. In the ending of the second game Ellie accepts that and **finally Joel's and Ellie's lives have meanings**.

### PLEASE READ THE SECTION 5 AS WELL!

# Final thoughts

## My thoughts on criticism about the ending

I feel like many of the complaints and negative feedback for Ellies decision to not kill Abby stems from the lack of empathy of the player or the clouded judgement of the player. You are making the same mistake as Ellie, mistaking her need of forgiving for a need of revenge. I hope some of you change your minds or at the very least feel differently about the ending of The Last of Us Part 2.

There are things that could have been done better but in my opinion the ending is not one of them.

## I did not play the game, only watched a non-commentary playthrough

I do not own a Playstation and I won't buy one for a single game. However, the game works very much like a movie or a TV series and I think I got a good enough experience watching it so that this post if justified.

## About Abby &amp; Ellie

Many people have said that they forgived each other. I strongly disagree. They realised that killing one another won't make it any better. Unfortunately both learned this in the most tragic ways. Abby realised that after killing Joel. She felt worse after killing him, not any better. This caused Ellie to try to avenge Joel and Abby lost her friends in the process and Ellie lost herself.

The cruel world they grew up in did not teach them what it means to be human but they learned it the hard way in this story.",thelastofus,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/pdt210/why_the_last_of_us_2_ending_is_meaningful_and_a/,Discussion,HomeworkDestroyer,pdt210,/r/thelastofus/comments/pdt210/why_the_last_of_us_2_ending_is_meaningful_and_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/pdt210/why_the_last_of_us_2_ending_is_meaningful_and_a/,31,2021-08-29
"I am distraught after a toxic relationship, but his mom blames me","I (29F) dated this guy (29M) for 8 months after meeting online. Everything was perfect in the beginning and his parents took me in and treated me like a daughter. I've never felt so loved by someone's else's parents before, it meant especially more because I was away from my own parents during this whole time because of covid. But everything started going downhill after the first few months, he would have random mental meltdowns and be really mean whenever he's under stress, I could never see it coming. But of course, like all toxic relationships there are the good times that make you hopeful that those bad moments that you want to believe are just temporary. Anyway long story short, it was drama after drama and he would gaslight me and manipulate my feelings, in a confused state I would actually feel guilty for his rollercoaster emotions. Then he would say things like I am perfect and there's no one else like me etc. to keep me stringing along. We finally broke up (he actually broke up with me after I confronted and told him I was really unhappy, instead of a light bulb going bright in his head to treat me better, self-pity took over and he said he's too weak, and said he'll block me on everything because he's ""bad for me"". Wtf?!?)

A week later I saw his mom to give her some of his stuff back, and his mom was always sweet and supportive towards me and told me ""he'll regret this, I'm so sorry you had to go through this"".

For the next couple weeks I was breaking down at work, crying at home, extremely depressed and I signed up to see a therapist. I couldn't fathom why somebody who was sinking would want me to drown with him, when I sincerely wanted the best for him and I. Then he broke his promise. He started messaging me being remorseful about the breakup... I didn't want to engage. I wanted to be a good person and hurt him the way he's hurt me. He got more aggressive calling me at random times and begging to just ""be a friend"". Eventually I had to respond because he still had my garage key. I didn't feel safe. I asked for it back and to that one response he poured out more and telling me that he's worried about me and my non-responses gives HIM anxiety. I finally lost it. I told him how traumatizing it's been dating him and I want nothing more to do with him. I told him to mail the key to me, he initially said ok then the next day asked to drop it off at my place. I said no and to mail it asap. He said ok again. Almost a week went by and he hasn't mailed it. I gave him a deadline, but he ""slept"" through. 

His mom's been caring and checking up on me after the break up, so I finally decided to open up to her and I told her I haven't been doing well. Her first texts back were really sweet, she said she wants to show me more love, give me a hug, make sure I'm ok, etc. Then immediately after she asked if I've forgiven her son. She wrote this long text about how unforgiveness causes stress and anxiety??

Am I being gaslighted by his mom too?

I'm at a loss.

What do I do with my massive amounts of anxiety,"I am an extremely anxious person and because of this had to step away from working a few months ago. With this being said, I have had to work from home the past few months to skate by. THis has been really difficult because of the pandemic. Every time I go out it feels like I just lock up and don't know how to talk to someone. 

My parents want me to get back out there but its tough. I don't actually know who or what I should do. Every time I talk with my friends they all talk about their high paying gigs that they work and their incomes that blow them out of the water. I was on track to make this happen myself until this happened, now I don't know what to think or if I will find a way out. I try to do this but no matter how hard I try it doesn't feel like I am good enough for the positions I apply for. I feel useless.

What should I do to make things work? I have exhausted all of my resources and still feel completely unable to go out. To make matters worse I think I may be getting worse instead of better. Something about not talking to people throughout the day has made me to deteriorate instead of improve. 

My ex says she has seen nothing like it, and that this is a one sided problem for her. I really don't think I could do anything to help improve the situation no matter how much I have tried. I have tried counting, journalling, many things to work through where I am but nothing seems to work. 

Any ideas on how I can overcome this? Or am I stuck to being an extremely anxious person.",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pdwz7t/what_do_i_do_with_my_massive_amounts_of_anxiety/,,Alloutofideasf,pdwz7t,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pdwz7t/what_do_i_do_with_my_massive_amounts_of_anxiety/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pdwz7t/what_do_i_do_with_my_massive_amounts_of_anxiety/,6,2021-08-29
Was my [22F] ex bf [25M] abusive or did we have a toxic attachment?,"I am trying to get my head around my relationship which recently ended. 

It started with us talking for a while and then going on a first date, this coincided with him beginning a job that made him incredibly depressed, he also told me he didn‚Äôt have many friends and had social anxiety. 

We would text all day every day, deep flirtatious exciting conversations. I would push for meeting up more/having more dates/moving to an irl form of communication but he would always either stand me up or stonewall.
 
The New Years before covid I became emotional about how he was treating me like a girlfriend/crush over text but was refusing to make any in real life effort or commitments, he told me that he wasn‚Äôt actually interested in me as we had different schedules? and he was planning on moving countries so he was no interested in anyone. 
It was confusing because he continued to text me in the same flirtatious/couple like manner instead of cutting me off?
 I was understanding but a while after he told me he couldn‚Äôt be with anyone, he updated his tinder profile. 
I know my reaction was irrational but this upset me very much, he told me he wasn‚Äôt interested in anyone whilst still texting me as if I was a girlfriend/fwb and then updated his dating profiles, this made me feel extremely degraded and defective. 

After this conversation we continued texting as if we were together and got into the same cycle before of me wanting to make this an in real life thing or even see each other in person, he would make promises after promises and never keep them. 

The most degrading time was that Valentine‚Äôs Day, he had been telling me for a couple of weeks that he wanted to spend it with me and had all these exciting and romantic plans, but when the day came, he wouldn‚Äôt meet me but sent me a bunch of dick pics and went to his family home to spend it with his mother. 
He told me he did this because he was extremely upset he had been rejected at a job interview that day. 

Then lockdown came, he once again went to his family home and spent all of lockdown there and quit his job, continuing the cycle of texting me as if I was a girlfriend, telling me he loved me, making plans etc. but when lockdown ended, he wouldn‚Äôt meet me despite us having plans. He stood me up on his birthday, he said he wanted to spend it with me and I had planned a little celebration for him and the day before he confessed to me that his mother had planned something. This upset me extremely as over lockdown he made extremely romantic and ornate plans for us for when it ended and once it ended he wouldn‚Äôt even see me, even when I spent a lot of time, effort and money on his birthday, he still stood me up. 
We fought about this for a few days and he confessed that on his birthday he went from ‚Äúpharmacy to pharmacy to collect medication‚Äù to attempt suicide. Insinuating that my upset at him standing me up was driving him to suicide. 

He then stood me up on my birthday. I spent the entire day waiting for him. He never came and didn‚Äôt even send a birthday card or present. 

He treated me in an incredibly abnormal and confusing way and I did not know how to react or handle it. He wouldn‚Äôt invite me to his family home (he moved back there permanently over lockdown) and wouldn‚Äôt come to mine, he also would hide me on and from his social media‚Äôs which hurt a lot because he would like a lot of girls pictures on there. He also told me that he could only be with me/treat me like a normal girlfriend if he had his own place and job. 

This cycle continued, it got even more intense and stressful and eventually became abusive. 
With him telling me that his entire family hated me and that‚Äôs why he had to treat me this way and hide me etc. And in my becoming depressed, attempting suicide and developing PTSD. 
Even when I briefly went through a period of homelessness during lockdown, he told me that his family hated me, would never let me in their house and that he would try his best to convince them that I‚Äôm actually ‚Äúgood‚Äù. (I have never met or spoken to his family)

He then used my suicide attempt as a reason as to why he wouldn‚Äôt see me and would only text me. 
(During that time, I blamed him for my attempt and he became extremely extremely upset and stressed that that would cause him to get in trouble/get in trouble with the law or be arrested. I regret blaming him directly for my attempt, it was an incredibly toxic and horrible thing to do. The stress of him telling me that everyone hated me and the stress of this relationship causing me to drop out of school got to me, that is not an excuse but an explanation).  

This cycle continued and got worse and worse. I was chronically suicidal, depressed and traumatised at the way he was treating me (I was receiving professional help for this) and he was incredibly diminutive and invalidating of how cruel his behaviour towards me was and how it was affecting me. 

He told me for weeks that what I was feeling wasn‚Äôt normal and that I needed serious help and being depressed/suicidal ‚Äúover a boy‚Äù and would give me instructions on what to say to the dr which were again downplaying and diminutive of the situation and putting the blame on me.  

His promises got bigger, his future faking got bigger and more ornate which made the blow of him not carrying them out even bigger.",relationship_advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pdz0yn/was_my_22f_ex_bf_25m_abusive_or_did_we_have_a/,,lecollecteur,pdz0yn,/r/relationship_advice/comments/pdz0yn/was_my_22f_ex_bf_25m_abusive_or_did_we_have_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pdz0yn/was_my_22f_ex_bf_25m_abusive_or_did_we_have_a/,2,2021-08-29

"The more I mature as a human being, the less the concept of Twin Flames appeals to me / A criticism of the TF community","TW: Mentions of sexual assault, including nonconsensual

It's weird to think about how I was back before I befriended her, and how backwards a lot of my thinking was. That was before I knew how to truly love myself, and no one was really offering me any love that was so intense. This was also only a few months post awakening, when I was very susceptible to things under the spiritual bypassing umbrella. Perhaps I was just hopeful that she was my twin because ""someone has to complete me"" or some shit like that, but looking back, I do believe it was her I loved and not the idea of a twin. I loved her a lot, but I don't think I really cared that she wasn't able to reciprocate in an equal manner. She did verbally assure me that she did love me, which I did believe as I could sorta feel it, but there was definitely some blockage. Point is, I think I wanted someone to love more than someone to love me. Someone I could love with a burning passion like none other. 


She's gone now, and probably won't be back. I've ""surrendered"", I've made major strides in my healing, and I believe I've done what was necessary to allow her to re enter my life, but she hasn't. I'm not disappointed at this point, and I'm not really looking for answers as to why she still isn't here or actively trying to get her back into the picture. It makes me wonder about the structure of the twin flame relationship fed to us by people online. I'm especially taking about those blog sites that detail the 7 or 8 or so stages of the twin flame journey. They make it sound so clear cut, so innocent even, like there's no way you could ever unintentionally harm your twin or derail your ""union"". Even the sites that explain how difficult the journey can seem very simplified. I don't think it's necessary to try to divide the twin flame journey into sections when it doesn't seem to be nearly as rigid. There's also of course the almighty youtube tarot reader's union, but I digress.


I don't really feel anything that could be described as ""her"" anymore. I've always had this weird thing where my eye will start to tear up if she's feeling some emotion to an extreme, typically sadness, but it's just a bodily sensation and doesn't effect my mood, and even that happens a lot less. I used to feel bursts of her love randomly, but that stopped a long time ago. It makes me wonder if it was just me making myself feel that way or what. But I think I don't really need her anymore. My self love has improved a lot. For the first time in my life I actually feel secure in myself, I actually feel consistently loved. I'm increasingly coming to accept that I don't need her, and increasingly ok with her being gone. Furthermore, I don't really know if I want anything to do with her, even if she ever becomes ok with it. 


I still love her. I want her to live her best life, but I don't think I have a role in that. If anything I've caused her unnecessary harm that she may not fully recover from for years, if not decades. I don't care if anyone tries to tell me how necessary it was for that to occur in order for her to heal, it shouldn't have happened. The circumstances that happen to us aren't what heals us, or what makes us grow. It's us. All the outside circumstances do is trigger us and nothing more. It's us who decide we don't want it to affect us anymore so we adapt. Don't justify bad things happening to you as ""healing opportunities"" or ""part of your life path"". Sometimes horrible things are just horrible for the sake of being horrible. You don't need an excuse to improve yourself. 


It annoys me in both the TF community and the larger Spirituality community how prevalent this line of thinking is, where you deserve everything that happens to you and that everything happens for a reason. Sure, sexual assault happens for a reason. It happens because human pieces of shit have no regard for women outside of their sex appeal. You can tell yourself till the cows come home how women who get raped deserved it because of their energetic alignments, or because their shield wasn't strong enough or whatever, but that doesn't change the fact that rapists exist and rarely face legal punishment. Are we just going to let this filth stain our society? Tell ourselves it's our fault for being receptive to them, and not theirs for actually fucking doing it? Extreme example, I know, but this line of thinking lends itself to being applied under such extreme circumstances. Rape itself makes my blood boil enough, but I hate little more than when victims of rape or other such heinous crimes are made to think they deserve it. There are very serious ramifications for perpetuating these ideas of deserving all you get and thinking they are all necessary for your growth and development. It needs to stop, and we need to focus our efforts on ending the things that do us injustice.",TwinFlame,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinFlame/comments/pdqr1l/the_more_i_mature_as_a_human_being_the_less_the/,,DualistilyWhole,pdqr1l,/r/TwinFlame/comments/pdqr1l/the_more_i_mature_as_a_human_being_the_less_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinFlame/comments/pdqr1l/the_more_i_mature_as_a_human_being_the_less_the/,9,2021-08-29
What denomination or church would my husband and I fit into?,"Hey everyone,

Hope this post is OK. I made a similar post earlier and got some useful tips, including to check out UMC, but would like to hear from people of more denominations. Thank you for taking the time to help me!

Background: My husband and I are young married Catholics (early 20s). Or rather, we were both raised Catholic but lost faith in the Church in our teens. Now that we have been married civilly, we are hesitant to go back as the Church doesn't recognize our marriage and we could have to get it 'consolidated', even though we are already married. In addition, we can't explain away the scandals, from sex abuse to the Indigenous unmarked gravesites and the Magdalene laundries. So we have decided to look for a new Church.

Spirituality: We very much believe in God. We pray often at home to Jesus. My husband is skeptical about saints and miracles, as he feels like anyone could fake one, but this isn't a deal-breaker; he will probably not take well to any denomination or church that has a 'human prophet' post-Jesus like Mormonism, though.

What we want in a Church: We use birth control. We don't believe in abortion personally, but would not want this to be a hot button issue for the church. We believe in God's love and therefore want a church that is actually accepting of LGBTQ members, even if they are not theologically given a full-on 'marriage' but rather a commitment ceremony or something like that. We are college educated professionals (well, at least my husband is a professional, but we are both 'intellectuals' in the non-pejorative sense) and we would prefer a pastor who has a proper understanding of the Bible in its historical context, and who can explain the Scriptures in a logical and eloquent way. We would not fit into a Church that is anti-science, we believe that climate change is real, vaccines are good, and that evolution actually happened. We are not too into 'exuberant' worship, so no speaking in tongues or shouting or anything too over the top like that - just personal preference. We would also not like a Church where everyone has to stand up and give testimony, or a Church which emphasizes conversion/proselytism. We just want a nice community which believes in Jesus, loves each other as He commanded, and prays for each other. Ideally this community would be young and thriving, and it would be socially acceptable to get married young, as we did. We don't really drink and definitely don't use drugs.

What we can give to our Church: I'm big into volunteering, I used to help teach catechism classes/Sunday school, also volunteered for a hotline and a soup kitchen. So any church with lots of service to the poor and homeless would be good. My husband just wants some male friends with the same values that we have - very 'centrist' politically and not at all 'racist'. We are a mixed-race couple so joining a community with some degree of ethnic cohesion, e.g. Mennonites, would probably not end well. We live in a major East Coast city so will probably be able to find most major denominations.

As Catholics we are somewhat resisting going full-on 'high church' Protestant due to the history of conflict there, especially in Ireland where much of his family is from. Please share something about your denomination and whether we would fit in!",Christianity,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/pe4942/what_denomination_or_church_would_my_husband_and/,,hausfrau224,pe4942,/r/Christianity/comments/pe4942/what_denomination_or_church_would_my_husband_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/pe4942/what_denomination_or_church_would_my_husband_and/,22,2021-08-29

Anyone else always read the acronym as a ‚ÄúPiece of Shit‚Äù algorithm?,"Happens to me literally every. single. time. I see it! 
Too much time on Reddit I suppose!




NB: on the subject of linguistics, here‚Äôs a fun poem purely to fill the word count quota, that even as a Brit with English as my first language and an A* A Level in Eng Literature (top grade HighSchool diploma for you yanks) - I still can never make it all the way through without my mind melting‚Ä¶.


Gerard Nolst Trenit√© - The Chaos (1922)

Dearest creature in creation
Studying English pronunciation,
   I will teach you in my verse
   Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse.

I will keep you, Susy, busy,
Make your head with heat grow dizzy;
   Tear in eye, your dress you'll tear;
   Queer, fair seer, hear my prayer.

Pray, console your loving poet,
Make my coat look new, dear, sew it!
   Just compare heart, hear and heard,
   Dies and diet, lord and word.

Sword and sward, retain and Britain
(Mind the latter how it's written).
   Made has not the sound of bade,
   Say-said, pay-paid, laid but plaid.

Now I surely will not plague you
With such words as vague and ague,
   But be careful how you speak,
   Say: gush, bush, steak, streak, break, bleak ,

Previous, precious, fuchsia, via
Recipe, pipe, studding-sail, choir;
   Woven, oven, how and low,
   Script, receipt, shoe, poem, toe.

Say, expecting fraud and trickery:
Daughter, laughter and Terpsichore,
   Branch, ranch, measles, topsails, aisles,
   Missiles, similes, reviles.

Wholly, holly, signal, signing,
Same, examining, but mining,
   Scholar, vicar, and cigar,
   Solar, mica, war and far.

From ""desire"": desirable-admirable from ""admire"",
Lumber, plumber, bier, but brier,
   Topsham, brougham, renown, but known,
   Knowledge, done, lone, gone, none, tone,

One, anemone, Balmoral,
Kitchen, lichen, laundry, laurel.
   Gertrude, German, wind and wind,
   Beau, kind, kindred, queue, mankind,

Tortoise, turquoise, chamois-leather,
Reading, Reading, heathen, heather.
   This phonetic labyrinth
   Gives moss, gross, brook, brooch, ninth, plinth.

Have you ever yet endeavoured
To pronounce revered and severed,
   Demon, lemon, ghoul, foul, soul,
   Peter, petrol and patrol?

Billet does not end like ballet;
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet.
   Blood and flood are not like food,
   Nor is mould like should and would.

Banquet is not nearly parquet,
Which exactly rhymes with khaki.
   Discount, viscount, load and broad,
   Toward, to forward, to reward,

Ricocheted and crocheting, croquet?
Right! Your pronunciation's OK.
   Rounded, wounded, grieve and sieve,
   Friend and fiend, alive and live.

Is your r correct in higher?
Keats asserts it rhymes Thalia.
   Hugh, but hug, and hood, but hoot,
   Buoyant, minute, but minute.

Say abscission with precision,
Now: position and transition;
   Would it tally with my rhyme
   If I mentioned paradigm?

Twopence, threepence, tease are easy,
But cease, crease, grease and greasy?
   Cornice, nice, valise, revise,
   Rabies, but lullabies.

Of such puzzling words as nauseous,
Rhyming well with cautious, tortious,
   You'll envelop lists, I hope,
   In a linen envelope.

Would you like some more? You'll have it!
Affidavit, David, davit.
   To abjure, to perjure. Sheik
   Does not sound like Czech but ache.

Liberty, library, heave and heaven,
Rachel, loch, moustache, eleven.
   We say hallowed, but allowed,
   People, leopard, towed but vowed.

Mark the difference, moreover,
Between mover, plover, Dover.
   Leeches, breeches, wise, precise,
   Chalice, but police and lice,

Camel, constable, unstable,
Principle, disciple, label.
   Petal, penal, and canal,
   Wait, surmise, plait, promise, pal,

Suit, suite, ruin. Circuit, conduit
Rhyme with ""shirk it"" and ""beyond it"",
   But it is not hard to tell
   Why it's pall, mall, but Pall Mall.

Muscle, muscular, gaol, iron,
Timber, climber, bullion, lion,
   Worm and storm, chaise, chaos, chair,
   Senator, spectator, mayor,

Ivy, privy, famous; clamour
Has the a of drachm and hammer.
   Pussy, hussy and possess,
   Desert, but desert, address.

Golf, wolf, countenance, lieutenants
Hoist in lieu of flags left pennants.
   Courier, courtier, tomb, bomb, comb,
   Cow, but Cowper, some and home.

""Solder, soldier! Blood is thicker"",
Quoth he, ""than liqueur or liquor"",
   Making, it is sad but true,
   In bravado, much ado.

Stranger does not rhyme with anger,
Neither does devour with clangour.
   Pilot, pivot, gaunt, but aunt,
   Font, front, wont, want, grand and grant.

Arsenic, specific, scenic,
Relic, rhetoric, hygienic.
   Gooseberry, goose, and close, but close,
   Paradise, rise, rose, and dose.

Say inveigh, neigh, but inveigle,
Make the latter rhyme with eagle.
   Mind! Meandering but mean,
   Valentine and magazine.

And I bet you, dear, a penny,
You say mani-(fold) like many,
   Which is wrong. Say rapier, pier,
   Tier (one who ties), but tier.

Arch, archangel; pray, does erring
Rhyme with herring or with stirring?
   Prison, bison, treasure trove,
   Treason, hover, cover, cove,

Perseverance, severance. Ribald
Rhymes (but piebald doesn't) with nibbled.
   Phaeton, paean, gnat, ghat, gnaw,
   Lien, psychic, shone, bone, pshaw.

Don't be down, my own, but rough it,
And distinguish buffet, buffet;
   Brood, stood, roof, rook, school, wool, boon,
   Worcester, Boleyn, to impugn.

Say in sounds correct and sterling
Hearse, hear, hearken, year and yearling.
   Evil, devil, mezzotint,
   Mind the z! (A gentle hint.)

Now you need not pay attention
To such sounds as I don't mention,
   Sounds like pores, pause, pours and paws,
   Rhyming with the pronoun yours;

Nor are proper names included,
Though I often heard, as you did,
   Funny rhymes to unicorn,
   Yes, you know them, Vaughan and Strachan.

No, my maiden, coy and comely,
I don't want to speak of Cholmondeley.
   No. Yet Froude compared with proud
   Is no better than McLeod.

But mind trivial and vial,
Tripod, menial, denial,
   Troll and trolley, realm and ream,
   Schedule, mischief, schism, and scheme.

Argil, gill, Argyll, gill. Surely
May be made to rhyme with Raleigh,
   But you're not supposed to say
   Piquet rhymes with sobriquet.

Had this invalid invalid
Worthless documents? How pallid,
   How uncouth he, couchant, looked,
   When for Portsmouth I had booked!

Zeus, Thebes, Thales, Aphrodite,
Paramour, enamoured, flighty,
   Episodes, antipodes,
   Acquiesce, and obsequies.

Please don't monkey with the geyser,
Don't peel 'taters with my razor,
   Rather say in accents pure:
   Nature, stature and mature.

Pious, impious, limb, climb, glumly,
Worsted, worsted, crumbly, dumbly,
   Conquer, conquest, vase, phase, fan,
   Wan, sedan and artisan.

The th will surely trouble you
More than r, ch or w.
   Say then these phonetic gems:
   Thomas, thyme, Theresa, Thames.

Thompson, Chatham, Waltham, Streatham,
There are more but I forget 'em-
   Wait! I've got it: Anthony,
   Lighten your anxiety.

The archaic word albeit
Does not rhyme with eight-you see it;
   With and forthwith, one has voice,
   One has not, you make your choice.

Shoes, goes, does *. Now first say: finger;
Then say: singer, ginger, linger.
   Real, zeal, mauve, gauze and gauge,
   Marriage, foliage, mirage, age,

Hero, heron, query, very,
Parry, tarry fury, bury,
   Dost, lost, post, and doth, cloth, loth,
   Job, Job, blossom, bosom, oath.

Faugh, oppugnant, keen oppugners,
Bowing, bowing, banjo-tuners
   Holm you know, but noes, canoes,
   Puisne, truism, use, to use?

Though the difference seems little,
We say actual, but victual,
   Seat, sweat, chaste, caste, Leigh, eight, height,
   Put, nut, granite, and unite.

Reefer does not rhyme with deafer,
Feoffer does, and zephyr, heifer.
   Dull, bull, Geoffrey, George, ate, late,
   Hint, pint, senate, but sedate.

Gaelic, Arabic, pacific,
Science, conscience, scientific;
   Tour, but our, dour, succour, four,
   Gas, alas, and Arkansas.

Say manoeuvre, yacht and vomit,
Next omit, which differs from it
   Bona fide, alibi
   Gyrate, dowry and awry.

Sea, idea, guinea, area,
Psalm, Maria, but malaria.
   Youth, south, southern, cleanse and clean,
   Doctrine, turpentine, marine.

Compare alien with Italian,
Dandelion with battalion,
   Rally with ally; yea, ye,
   Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, key, quay!

Say aver, but ever, fever,
Neither, leisure, skein, receiver.
   Never guess-it is not safe,
   We say calves, valves, half, but Ralf.

Starry, granary, canary,
Crevice, but device, and eyrie,
   Face, but preface, then grimace,
   Phlegm, phlegmatic, ass, glass, bass.

Bass, large, target, gin, give, verging,
Ought, oust, joust, and scour, but scourging;
   Ear, but earn; and ere and tear
   Do not rhyme with here but heir.

Mind the o of off and often
Which may be pronounced as orphan,
   With the sound of saw and sauce;
   Also soft, lost, cloth and cross.

Pudding, puddle, putting. Putting?
Yes: at golf it rhymes with shutting.
   Respite, spite, consent, resent.
   Liable, but Parliament.

Seven is right, but so is even,
Hyphen, roughen, nephew, Stephen,
   Monkey, donkey, clerk and jerk,
   Asp, grasp, wasp, demesne, cork, work.

A of valour, vapid vapour,
S of news (compare newspaper),
   G of gibbet, gibbon, gist,
   I of antichrist and grist,

Differ like diverse and divers,
Rivers, strivers, shivers, fivers.
   Once, but nonce, toll, doll, but roll,
   Polish, Polish, poll and poll.

Pronunciation-think of Psyche!-
Is a paling, stout and spiky.
   Won't it make you lose your wits
   Writing groats and saying ""grits""?

It's a dark abyss or tunnel
Strewn with stones like rowlock, gunwale,
   Islington, and Isle of Wight,
   Housewife, verdict and indict.

Don't you think so, reader, rather,
Saying lather, bather, father?
   Finally, which rhymes with enough,
   Though, through, bough, cough, hough, sough, tough??

Hiccough has the sound of sup...

"(F4M) Childhood friends, time traveler, nuclear fallout etc. Searching for longterm literate partner!"," Heyo! My name is Hannah, and I am in my early 20s. I‚Äôm hoping to jump back into roleplaying after a pretty long hiatus. My writing style is literate, and you should expect at least a couple paragraphs with each entry. I ask for my partner to match my speed, but I also realize in certain circumstances a couple of lines is sufficient. With that said, I also realize we have lives outside of writing. I am a fulltime student and work a few jobs from home. I have ample time to send out multiple responses a day, but sometimes I do get busy! I will always communicate if I have some setbacks. 

Things I am wanting in a partner:

\- Literate style writing, third person. At least a paragraph with each entry! As long as you are able to give me enough information to bounce off of, we‚Äôll be good to go! I will never expect a novel type response from you. c:

\- Be able to write for multiple characters! I want our world building to be fleshed out, so having multiple characters at a time is wonderful. It can be boring with one person contributing to writing for all NPCS. Be willing to jump in with side characters! 

\-I really enjoy talking OOC and sharing potential plot ideas. It‚Äôs not a necessity, but it is more engaging!

\-I use discord only for roleplaying. It‚Äôs more organized and convenient.

\-Please be 18+. 

\-Shoot me an interesting message. What idea interests you? Have any questions? What‚Äôs your favorite cereal? 

\-Literally just have fun with it. This is a fun hobby and pastime! I tend to find writing relaxing so I don‚Äôt want it to feel like a hassle. 

Potential plot ideas: 

1. CHILDHOOD FRIENDS: It was only a couple weeks after your character‚Äôs tenth birthday when he received life changing news. Years of enduring his parent‚Äôs bickering and fighting has ultimately landed the married couple a divorce. Being so young, he had no real input, and soon was traveling with his father to a new home for the two of them. The unknown is frightening for someone so young and confused, not to mention what all would be left behind from his old home. You move into a small town, not too far off from distant relatives, and move into a pretty less than satisfactory rented apartment. The first days are miserable. No running air conditioner, too many unfamiliar faces, and you think there might be a mouse problem. Not long after moving in, you are introduced to a neighbor girl your age. I imagine this to be a coming of age story with a long slow burn romance between two childhood friends growing up together and sharing hardships. 
2. TIME TRAVELER: The year is 1895. The heartlands of America  are still massively sporadic, with towns spread out and ranches hard to come by without proper direction or a reliable horse. In the midst of a summer storm, a critically injured man is found lying unconscious in the middle of a pasture. His breathing is shallow; he‚Äôs lost a considerable amount of blood. It seems he is just barely clinging onto his life. Unnerved, but abundantly concerned, a small ranch family urgently takes the stranger under their roof. He is steadily nursed back to health, but skepticism is rising within the home. Who exactly is this stranger? What could he have done to deserve a bullet or two? Why does he dress so weird? For the farmer‚Äôs daughter, however, petty details can be ignored for the chance of receiving an excuse to leave the farm lifestyle. For the man, he desperately needs to find a way back to his time in 2300 and evade the time police who are tracking him down. 
3. NUCLEAR FALLOUT: It has been generations since the fallout. Humanity has found ways to evade the dangers of radiation from the surface within bunkers made from old salt mines. Living cramped underground has proved to be no suitable lifestyle, and supplies are dwindling. Scout regimes are constructed to send parties to the surface in search of usable resources, research, and rescues. The job is no simple task. Earth‚Äôs surface has transformed into something alien as nature fights to jump back from extinction. Nobody had expected mutant lifeforms to be the biggest threat to survival. 

\-Some other options I am willing to explore are supernatural creatures, zombies, fantasy DnD style settings, and literally anything else if you can sell me on the idea. Thank you if you‚Äôve read this far! Feel free to PM me and I‚Äôll write back as soon as I am able! Let me know what you‚Äôre interested in as well c:",Roleplay,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/pe2b99/f4m_childhood_friends_time_traveler_nuclear/,Still-Looking,hannahasch,pe2b99,/r/Roleplay/comments/pe2b99/f4m_childhood_friends_time_traveler_nuclear/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/pe2b99/f4m_childhood_friends_time_traveler_nuclear/,2,2021-08-29
No power coming from distributor after valve cover gasket replacement.,I recently replaced the valve cover gasket off my 96 honda covic lx replaced everything the way it was suppose to go once finished I started up my vehicle and started driving the car to test it and it just stalled after about 4min. Thankfully It stalled close to where I live and I pushed it back home. I checked to see of I left any hoses or connections lose and nothing. Had someone see if there was power coming out of the distributor while I turn the ignition and nope no power I thought my distributor went out again as it had happened before I ended up getting another one and replacing it and still nothing I also checked the main relay (under glove box) and it looked burnt so I also replaced that as well and still nothing. Anyone know what the problem may be? Also when I turn the ignition key i've notices a electrical buzzing sound by where the injectors/air filter go so idk if that was normal or part of the problem.,MechanicAdvice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/pdll74/no_power_coming_from_distributor_after_valve/,,Salvar88,pdll74,/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/pdll74/no_power_coming_from_distributor_after_valve/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/pdll74/no_power_coming_from_distributor_after_valve/,5,2021-08-29
Am I wrong for asking my +6 year friend for a break?," 

I (18-year-old female) have been friends with, let's call him Josh, (18-year-old male) for over 6 years. We met when we were in 5th grade, and had been friends ever seen. However, our friendship has always been rocky. Whenever he had a problem in his house he would come to school and treat me badly, with the excuse ""sorry, things are rough at home"". I kinda understood back then, I didn't want my friend to be upset, so if I could, I would help him. He was my best friend at the time.

But, as time went by, stuff would get more complicated. We have come on and off with problems here and there, I took the decision to just be a regular or close friend to him instead of his best friend, for my own mental health. Even though I had told him I wanted to keep things casual, he never seemed to understand, and would still refer to me as ""his best friend"". The strangest part for me at the time, was that he would get mad, and jealous, whenever I referred to my best friends as such.

Anyways, when we were in sophomore year he transferred schools so he could get a career faster once he finished high school. For that time, we would do our best to text every day so he wouldn't get lonely, and I was ok with that. We still had our differences, and he still would treat me badly once in a while, but I let it pass. When he had issues at home or felt alone at school, I always tried my best to be empathetic and help him as I could, giving him support, or trying to tell him how I may have passed by something similar, but immediately go back and pay attention to his issues. Well, one day he texted me saying I always talked too much about myself, and he wanted his own space to talk about his, of course, I respected his wishes and did my best to empathize some other way, just being there for him and listening to what he has to say. Either way, this upset him too, saying now he didn't know anything that happened to me anymore because I hardly talked about myself to him. I just told him I wasn't comfortable with doing so anymore so we could be more centered about what happened to him throughout his day. He let it pass and stuff went by normally.

I graduated high school last year, while in his school he still needs to take an extra year. Since he left our school we haven't hanged out (plus, my mom isn't fond of him because of the problems we had) and that made him upset, but, for birthdays or maybe big friend reunions would be enough to his mind and hang out with the others. The thing is, 2020 and 2021 have been the hardest years for me regarding our friendship. Everything that I do upset him somehow, if he has issues or he wants to talk about something, he then tells me I'm not invested in the conversation or that I'm being dry (because by text I use ""mhm"", ""aha"", as I do Irl). The worst part, if he needed advice and I gave it to him, he would also feel upset and tell me that my advice wouldn't work for him because of his ADD, etc. I tried my best not to mind, but it just started getting worse, for example, he would tell me not to use certain emojis (like the shrugging one) because he thought it was offensive and made me look like a ""smartass"".

Some weeks ago, I finally had enough with his bs, because no matter what I did, nothing was ever enough for him and his peace of mind. My friends started getting worried too, as anything I said would make him lose his shit. I tried to be a bit more distant, instead of texting every day, maybe I would text him every two days or so, telling him I was busy or needed to do college stuff (which I do have to). This upset him deeply (as usual) since we used to text every day, I told him that it wasn't necessary to do so since he had his life and I had mine, and he also had to concentrate on his last year of high school (which he isn't doing very well at). After going on and off, he respected my wish and we talked a bit less, which gave me peace for some time. It didn't take long tho, for him to ask me ""hey, are we ok??"" which I answered as yes. He said he was once again overthinking and that he didn't want to lose me, since I am important to him and thanks to me ""he has a reason to keep going"" (a bit of a red flag if you ask me). He told me he wanted to talk to me every day again, tell me about what happened to him, and he also said he wanted me to talk about my stuff, I made it clear before that I wouldn't do so since our fight months ago, which he said ""I have a bad memory and I don't remember telling you that"", he tried to avoid the discussion and tried to leave it there, but I had enough.

I told him how it was very hard for me to keep up with him, since no matter how I would respond, I seemed dry, not caring, or the conversation would be one-sided, or if he needed advice and I gave it to him, then he would also be mad at me because he didn't like what I said. I expressed how I felt that I was talking with a ticking time bomb, that would explode no matter what I said. I was always doing the wrong thing for him, and I was tired of feeling that way. As I told him how I felt, he started saying that ""oh, I'm, such a shitty friend, a shitty person, I'm sorry I'm making stuff so hard for you"". He went on ranting how he wanted actual friends that would listen to him instead of a therapist, be with people talk, be calm. As the discussion went by, I told him I felt lost, and this friendship was making me lose myself. He tried his best to make me feel like this was just another simple fight, that it would be ok, and that he hated himself for making me feel bad, he wanted me to forget about it. I told him no, that I wanted us to have a break from this friendship, as it has always been toxic and I was getting harmed too, even my closest friends were worried about my well-being, I recommended he would talk to his therapist about the topic too. Not wanting to, he tried to respect it and give me the break I needed, I thanked him and didn't talk to him anymore.

However, some days later he told me he had talked to his therapist, and told me he would ""look at stuff from my point of view"", I thought maybe he would understand why I was so upset, but he went on saying how stuff was actually my fault and I needed to get help, I was dumbfounded, I couldn't believe my eyes. He told me he didn't need my answer just yet, so I let it be and didn't answer his text as I felt mad. Acting like a 12-year-old, he would post on ig ""relatable"" tik toks about how he is never understood, has no friends, and he always does his very best on a friendship but it is never enough, and I think he didn't understand the definition of break, as he still tried to send me posts and waited for me to react. I wanted to be a little petty, so I posted to my IG story part of a Jaiden's animation video, called ""Relationships"" (highly recommend it if you feel you are being part of a toxic relationship or friendship), since I felt what she described was similar to my situation, and my friends understood why I did so. Guess what, he didn't like it, texted me again, and expressed how he DID MANIPULATE ME several times, with the excuse, and I quote, ""I didn't want to lose you"". He also told me how I never answered his IG posts or tik toks that he would send me, so I wrote. ""There is a lot to say, but I asked for a break. That means we don't talk or interact in any way. Not even liking memes or tik toks to make you feel better, let's talk when I'm ready, thanks"" . he said ok, and let it be.

To finish, this Thursday he texted me saying he was mad at me as I never let go of anything he does and that I am a very ""spiteful"" person. That he thought my break was from thinking and not him. He told me I needed help and that now he is the one keeping me a causal friend, as he doesn't want me putting shit on him and being bad for his mental health, even had the audacity to tell me how I should change myself since ""No one likes a dry texter"" and that I always hold grudges against him. We had to talk, I told him (again) exactly what I felt, and now he said he is the one taking a break from me, as he doesn't want me being bad for him. He even said because of me he wouldn't go to a hangout this Sunday (when I told some friends we were in a rough patch and I wouldn't talk to him much, but I never said He couldn't go)

My friends have told me I am not at fault here, that I expressed myself and stood up for my feelings.

As he is absconding to evade arrest the criminal proceedings are pending. He is on work permit and has no greencard yet.

I know his company, his office location and his role, even the names of his colleagues, but on contacting his company's legal department, they are refusing to inform whether he has reported to work online. They said they are open to being the point of contact for legal requests and court orders. However, getting a confirmation that he is reporting to work online to prove that he is absconding to evade legal action is the only way I can get the court to order impoundment of his passport.

At this point, (1) how can I get his company to take some action against him? (2) What is the proper office to contact? USCIS/Consulate General of India/American Consulate? Are there any bodies or contacts I should reach out to? (3) How can I make sure he returns to India for the trial that is pending because of him?

Thank you in advance.",legaladviceofftopic,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/pe6e4r/indian_absconding_in_the_us_whom_to_contact_to/,,alwaysamuffin,pe6e4r,/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/pe6e4r/indian_absconding_in_the_us_whom_to_contact_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/pe6e4r/indian_absconding_in_the_us_whom_to_contact_to/,2,2021-08-29
I'm 22 and my parents still treat me like im 12,"Just a warning that this may be long but I need to say this somewhere.

I don't know if I truly have NParents, but what I do know is that they have caused me enough mental grief to make me create an alt account and post on this subreddit so I guess that be saying something. However, I can't help but think about if I'm overreacting about the way they treat me, given that there is no physical abuse and they have provided me with everything I've wanted or needed and seem caring and nice from the outside. A part of it is always invalidating my opinions which I guess has led me here to seek any sort of validation from others about my experiences. So I'm just going to give an example for each of them to show how they are and what I have to deal with (not that these are the only instance or ways they treat me).

&amp;#x200B;

* Earlier today I was helping my dad change the pool filter but I already had plans to go to the gym and he told me to help him last minute (which happens a lot and I miss going to the gym a lot). I didn‚Äôt tell him I was going to the gym but this is something he knows I do because I'm trying to get healthy and in shape. So I was kind of annoyed because he often interrupts my plans by telling me to do things last minute. I agreed to help him and he always wants to make it a ‚Äúlearning‚Äù experience for me but always ends up doing it if I‚Äôm not able to do it first try. So we needed to grease up something but just before that he had me get my hands dirty and didn't tell me to wash them off. I put some grease on my hands and then he yelled at me that my hands needed to be clean. I kind of hesitantly told him that he was the one that had me get my hands dirty and then he started telling me I had an attitude. At this point I didn‚Äôt say anything back because I know how it goes. Then I was tightening something and he again told me I wasn‚Äôt doing it right so he told me to move aside and I kind of exhaled as I got up from bending over and he yelled at me that I was having an attitude again. I tried explaining that I was just exhaling and he cut me off to reiterate his point. He always does this and it slowly chips away at my feelings independence and maturity because it feels like something you would only say to a teenager or child, and I am 22. He also constantly wants to ‚Äúteach‚Äù me things because he wants me to be prepared I guess, but given that he always takes over eventually I feel like this is just a way of making himself feel more accomplished in his parenting because at least he tried. Not to mention that he sometimes just forgets that he‚Äôs explained something to me before and tries to explain it again, which makes it seem like he doesn‚Äôt understand that I‚Äôm an adult who can think and remember things myself. When I try to tell him he‚Äôs told me this before and I already know it, he either tells me I have an attitude or acts annoyed/frustrated that I didn‚Äôt want to hear it again.  

&amp;#x200B;

* About a year ago I was coming home from a long shift at work and wanted to make a sandwich for myself. As I was getting the ingredients out, my mom walks into the kitchen and greets me. I would like to preface this next part by saying that even though I‚Äôm 22, my mom still sometimes talks to me in the tone of voice you would talk to a 10 year old with, which is hard to explain in text form but it has hints of condescension while being quite passive with a certain inflection that I‚Äôm sure you can imagine. This gets very infantilizing. Anyways, after she greets me she met me with this tone of voice, telling me what I needed to do to make the sandwich and asking if I needed help, as if I didn‚Äôt know how to do it myself. This really triggered something in me and after a long time of just taking this and not telling her I didn‚Äôt like it, this time I finally just said calmly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really like when you talk to me in that tone like I‚Äôm a child‚Äù. That was a mistake. She immediately changed her facial expression to one of authority and sternness and just looked at me. She finally said that I was ungrateful and that she was just being nice, yet her being nice wasn‚Äôt my issue, it was just the way she said it. Rather than asking for more clarification on what I meant, I was immediately met with a defensive attitude like always. From this moment on I knew what would happen so I decided to just not say anything else and go to my room. A few minutes pass and she comes into my room with the same stern tone and continues to tell my how ungrateful I am sometimes and how she didn't like how I ""acted"" back there and I really need to start checking my ‚Äúattitude‚Äù. She continues to say how I need to grow up and and take more responsibility (where did all this come from???). And while these comments are being made by her I just sat there and took it, saying nothing like I always do because I‚Äôve been conditioned to be like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to move out because it always feels like I‚Äôm on their schedule and my life revolves around their choices/needs. Along with my desire to get some separation so I don't have to deal with them as often. However, I‚Äôm not in the position to move out because I don‚Äôt have a job yet after graduating college. So I have to keep taking all this from them for the foreseeable future and continue to have my personal growth and independence halted. The only reason I'm making this post is because I'm finally going to therapy and this issue of their parenting has been brought up, so I feel a little bit empowered to share it.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

Parents always treat me like a child even though I am 22 years old and any time I try to defend myself they invalidate my feelings and tell me I have an ""attitude"". This gets to be very infantilizing and I feel like it's halting my growth as a person and adult. I would also like to move out but I currently don't have a job after graduation so I feel stuck.",raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/pe1nkc/im_22_and_my_parents_still_treat_me_like_im_12/,[Rant/Vent],TheDireWolf2,pe1nkc,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/pe1nkc/im_22_and_my_parents_still_treat_me_like_im_12/,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/pe1nkc/im_22_and_my_parents_still_treat_me_like_im_12/,8,2021-08-29
Seeing a blonde cartoon girl on NOS + Shrooms + Ketamine,"So a couple months ago I read about combining psychedelics and whippets, instantly intrigued, I ordered everything I needed online. Skip ahead a couple months, I'm on a visit back to my home town (Nelson, BC, Canada) and I get my hands on some Ketamine which is always top notch in this town (Its a drug town filled with hippies). Earlier in the day me and my mom hiked up into the mountains to one of the most gorgeous waterfalls I have seen in a long time. Great hike. On our hour drive home we stopped at a little tourist location. Its an old ghost town named Sanden that was booming during the gold rush. There was a little museum with all sorts of interesting old shit in it and there were old train cars and old buses everywhere. The hike and the ghost town tie into the story later. Anyways, later that night I go hang out with an old friend and end up doing a couple grams of shrooms and a gram and a half or so of Ketamine, great visit. When I got home I wanted to test this K by K-holing and then just go to bed. I look at my vial and its only about 0.25 of a gram. I know that's not even close to enough to K-hole because my tolerance was through the roof. It isn't even enough to have any closed eye visuals of any kind either. I look in my box of whippets and I have 1 left. Instead of getting upset about it I just shrugged and said oh well. Sitting cross legged in bed, I filled up my balloon and took the line and pressed play on my headphones. As the line was just coming on I took the whippet. That's when everything turned to neon colours and what looked like happy faces spiralled all around me in a spectacular fashion as the music looped and echoed. Just at the peak of it, a little 1 foot tall blonde cartoon girl wearing green skipped across the air in my room, winked at me and jumped into a painting on the wall. WHAT. JUST. HAPPENED. With no time to think about it the K hit me hard and I laid back with my eyes closed only to be pleasantly surprised by the site of vivid CEVs (closed eye visuals). If you aren't familiar with ketamine CEVs I'll briefly explain. When you do enough K it turns into what I can only explain as an imax theatre in your head. If you stare into a light and then close your eyes you'll see a purple or red lingering flash left behind. I say red or purple because it depends on the brightness of the light seeping through your eyelids. This is usually what these visuals are comprised of. So most of the time you don't get full colour visuals. (I have had full colour visuals on certain batches of ketamine and certain times when I mixed K with mushrooms). The visuals are usually accompanied by sensations of moving. Sometimes you're moving down a corridor, tunnel, falling backwards, spinning or gliding along a surface. Most of the time the direction changes and it goes with your visuals. Anyways once I took that whippet and closed my eyes I was on a ghost train gliding through the moonlit sky!!!
This was the train I had seen earlier in Sanden and I was floating above the waterfall and mountains I had hiked to as well. The most peaceful song came on as all this was happening and it was so incredibly peaceful I started to tear up. After 15 minutes or so it slowly wore off and I just felt so thankful to be alive. The best way I can explain this ghost train ride through the sky is by referencing a scene from the Simpsons where homer falls asleep at the wheel and his car turns into a bed and he sails through the night sky peacefully. Ever since this moment I can't do a whippet without psychedelics. Doing a whippet without them is utterly pointless and this has helped me do less whippets. I save them for occasions where I do mushrooms and or K. I have yet to try whippets on LSD but I hear its pretty crazy and I'll try it when the time comes. 

I had a similar K-hole experience on this same K a few days later where I ascended and met angelic entities that told me everything would be ok but that's a story for a different day. Stay safe out there and don't forget to take B12.

PS
The link below is the song that came on during my ghost train ride. I must have exclusively listened to this song for a week after this experience

Paying it Foward,"‚ÄúHey, Smoke!‚Äù My service writer was screaming for me from four bays down. If it wasn‚Äôt a plea for help, and if I had my hands full, I‚Äôd scream back, ‚ÄúOi!?‚Äù ‚ÄúCome down here a minute!‚Äù

That‚Äôs generally what I‚Äôd hear as a response. 

I pulled my mind away from the current job and walked towards the screams. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù 

Like they always do, my service writer was standing underneath a vehicle with a flash light in hand, looking lost as shit. 

‚ÄúDo those lines look like their leaking?‚Äù I took a quick glance where he pointed the light, ‚Äúsure do.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat are those for?‚Äù I grabbed the flashlight from his hand and traced the plumbing back to the transmission. ‚ÄúTransmission.‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù ‚ÄúYup.‚Äù I walked back to the job I had at hand. 

A day passed‚Ä¶. A week passed‚Ä¶ Two weeks passed.

‚ÄúHey, Smoke!‚Äù ‚ÄúOi!?‚Äù ‚ÄúCome here when you get a minute!‚Äù I walked towards the screaming.  I found my Service Writer holding on to a dual hose assembly in a large see-through plastic bag. As I neared him, he tried to hand the assembly to me.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that,‚Äù I asked without taking it from him. I had learned, long ago, that if you take something that‚Äôs not yours from someone, it becomes yours to deal with. 

‚ÄúIs it the wrong hose assembly?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what that is.‚Äù ‚ÄúRemember the transmission cooler lines you looked at?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell you did.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶. What are these for?‚Äù ‚ÄúAn Audi you looked at.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay?‚Äù We stared at each other for a second. He stretched his arm back out with the hose assembly in hand. I took it. ‚ÄúIs the vehicle here?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call them now.‚Äù I threw the assembly underneath my tool box. 

Another week went by.

‚ÄúHey, Smoke!‚Äù ‚ÄúOi!?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is that hose assembly!?‚Äù ‚ÄúWHAT HOSE ASSEMBLY!?‚Äù The service writer didn‚Äôt respond. This would let me know he was moving towards my bays to begin a conversation at a normal decibel level. ‚ÄúThe one for the Audi.‚Äù ‚ÄúUhhhh‚Ä¶ oh‚Ä¶ Those hoses,‚Äù I asked while pointing under my box. He walked over and picked the assembly up. 

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶. Are these the right ones?‚Äù ‚ÄúI dunno.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, the Audi is here, and the ticket is on your box. Needs to get done today.‚Äù ‚ÄúNoooo problem.‚Äù He walked away and I pulled myself off of a tune-up to study the ticket quickly. 

4.5hrs - Transmission Cooler Hoses.

‚ÄúCool,‚Äù I thought to myself. I finished the tune-up and turned my attention towards the Audi. I was able to get the hose assembly loose and free floating in the engine bay. I saw that the alternator needed to get out of the way and I started on that obstacle. The alternator was water cooled and the dynamics of getting it out began to frustrate me. 

It wasn‚Äôt that I couldn‚Äôt get the job done, it was the burning question of, ‚Äúhow is this 4.5 hours?‚Äù

I made my way to the tech‚Äôs computer and looked up the procedures to do the transmission lines. I couldn‚Äôt find a procedure. I couldn‚Äôt find a labor rate. I couldn‚Äôt find anything, anywhere; that there was even a suggestion on how the job was to be done, or the time frame in which it should be completed. I walked upfront to my service writer.

‚ÄúHey. How did you get 4.5 hours to do these Audi tranny lines?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what they call for.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs cool‚Ä¶ I just spent about 15 minutes trying to find that info. Since you know where to find it, can you save me sometime and print up what you found?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù 

I walked back to the Audi and started to tackle the alternator. The service writer came out about 15 minutes later and approached me. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find the labor.‚Äù He looked apologetic.

I chuckled. ‚ÄúNo sweat. No sweat. We‚Äôll figure this out.‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty good at a disappointing smile, and shot one at him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it up to you somewhere.‚Äù ‚ÄúYea‚Ä¶ yea,‚Äù I trailed off and turned my back to him, and redirected my attention to the alternator. 

Once the alternator was out and the coolant lines were blocked off I attempted to remove the hose assembly again. I was able to budge it about six inches further from its home, but I had found that the starter motor would also have to be removed.

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù

I looked for starter labor. I had found it pretty quickly. 11.9 hours. 

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù

I walked into the service station. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù ‚ÄúI have to pull the starter out. It‚Äôs 11.9 hours labor.‚Äù He put his face into his hands. ‚ÄúUghhhha!‚Ä¶.‚Äù He sighed. 

We had a new service writer taking up space next to him. Three days in the shop and he couldn‚Äôt help himself, ‚ÄúMORE FREE SHIT!?!?‚Äù I smiled at him in my, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs funny, but not now,‚Äù type smile. He understood. We had quite a few labor disputes the past week, and he had moved in right in the middle of it all. 

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just get it done. It has to get done.‚Äù ‚ÄúYup. Just letting you know.‚Äù 

I was able to ‚Äúflat-rate‚Äù the job, in the end, using some AMG ‚Äòspecific‚Äô tools. The job would get finished the next day without any problems.

‚ÄúHey, Smoke!‚Äù ‚ÄúOi!‚Äù ‚ÄúSee me when you get a minute!‚Äù His tone was ‚Äúwhimsical.‚Äù I knew I could finish what I was doing without stressing him out. 

I opened the door to the service station and was greeted with a shit-eating-grin on my service writer. ‚ÄúCheck this out,‚Äù he said as he typed on his keyboard and whipped the mouse around, moving screens around at lightning pace. He pointed to the screen, ‚Äúso the client asked what it would have costed to do the full repair, and they wanted to make it right. So you got your full time‚Ä¶ look.‚Äù 

I looked at the screen and it showed a completed proof of service and he wasn‚Äôt kidding. The client payed in cash and ‚Äúmade it right.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù I said out loud. ‚ÄúRight!?!?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù ‚ÄúI dodged a bullet!‚Äù ‚ÄúFuck, YEA, you did! Amazing.

In need of healing,"Hello fellow witches! 

To make a long story short, my partner of 8 years left me, i moved home (400 miles) to live with my parents, and we have split our family in half. I took the dog I had before I met him and he took the dog we adopted together. The break up was originally amicable, he said it was because we were just not good for each other and he needed time apart. I took that as a weird 10 month break but we will get back together. Fast forward to him sending me the cruelest text messages I have ever received followed by him saying he still loves me, still misses me, and it is hard on him too because he is loosing his best friend. (BULLSHIT) Well, there is no way for me to ever get back with him. I already have a letting go burning ceremony planned for tomorrow and bathed with my crystals tonight. Any other assistance on the heart break front would be appreciated but that isn‚Äôt my immediate concern‚Ä¶ 

It is my dog, Chloe. She is my wonderful amazing loving Frenchie companion of 10 years. And although she has been to my parents house before for trips and holidays it has never been this long or without her best friend and my other dog. She is terribly depressed. She won‚Äôt eat, she hardly gets out of bed. I‚Äôm so worried for her. I can‚Äôt imagine what is going through her head because she has no idea why we are not seeing my ex and our other dog anymore. Does anyone have any rituals or anything to help ease the depression of an animal? She is so old so I‚Äôm scared she will just give up. Any thoughts and well wishes will be appreciated. We have tried all the usual walks, dogs parks, and meeting new humans on the street. She also has my parents two dogs here at the house but i think she finds them to be more of an annoyance‚Ä¶ 

Also i realized i started this post with, ‚Äúto make a long story short‚Äù and this has been anything but short.

Friend abandoned car in WY after it broke down. Does he need to take steps to remove the title from his name?,"My friend (lives in WA) drove to WY about a year ago, his car broke down in the mountains near Yellowstone.

Friends sent him some money to get a plane ticket home, sans-car. The car is presumably still in WY at the shop where he abandoned it. He still has the title and has not been contacted by anyone over the last year. He‚Äôs afraid to call the shop in case they ask him to pay for additional towing or other expenses.

Supporting my girlfriend through terminating a pregnancy,"I am not going to go into great detail because this is obviously quite a sensitive topic

My Girlfriend and I are both in our early 20's, have both become quite successful in our respective careers and are doing well in life together, we are in the final stages of buying our first home and are very happy where we are.

Recently we discovered she has fallen pregnant and she came to me upset because she knows she wants this to be our future, but she doesn't think we are ready. I agree on both fronts, although this is exactly what i want out future to be, I know we aren't in a position to give a new life the attention and care it would need. I know we're both going to make great parents in the future now just is not the right time for us, regardless no matter what she decides in the end I'm going to support her decision and make sure everything for her is as easy as possible.

My need for advice comes from the fact that I've heard a lot of horror stories in regards to the effect a termination can have on the mother. The most important part of all of this to me is to make sure she gets the right information and all of the support she needs.


So my question, what can I do to make sure everything about this is as easy as it can be for her, I obviously am going to be there every step of the way but I dont think I can imagine the emotional battle she may have with herself and therefore I want to try and be the best I can be for her in this situation, any advice at all is welcome but please understand any political views, no matter what your stance is, it really is not wanted right now, I'm not here to preach, I'm here to learn how I can make this easy for her.

AITA for telling my bio dad and his sisters that the reason their parents left everything to me is because they are idiots?,"
I apologize in advance, English is not my language and I am writing this with the translator. Normally I wouldn't do this, but things are getting out of hand and I'm starting to doubt

Context: My biological dad ""Bob"" sucks as a person, I consider him a sperm donor at most I got my mother pregnant and then left her with a simple ""Now you're fat"", My mother is a strong woman so she continued her life, mine for 3 years she met and married ""Marcos"", he is the only father I know and love , like your family mine.When I turned 13, Bob's parents contacted me, they had decided to leave me as their sole heir as a way to ""make up for the years of absence"", where I am from, college loan debts are not a problem like in the USA, so that money is not it was essential Anyway they continued with it, both died in the period of these 3 years, I can not say that I feel great pain but I did feel sorry With all the covid issue, my dad lost his job, that left him with a debt since the business was his. The only condition that Bob's parents put in was that the money could be used from my 16, the legal age to drive motorcycles and get tired in my country Both my parents and I were scared when we saw that the inheritance amounted to several million in land, more jewels, Bob has 3 sisters so I decided to leave the jewelry issues to them, now I think this brought a confusion .

A few weeks ago after talking to Bob's sisters about jewelry, they all came home with Bob, damn it was the first time I saw his face in 5 years, it was uncomfortable but it got more uncomfortable when they mentioned when and how I was going to repeat what the other inheritance My parents told him that I was not thinking about it, but about selling some to pay for some things, (specifically my dad's debt, I clarify that this was my idea) They went crazy and started screaming calling my mother things like ""manipulative"" ""Fortunes"" etc.

I'll be honest, it fell to me like shit that they will call my mother like that that is what I said, ""if your parents decided to leave everything to me, it's because they were fed up with supporting a bunch of idiots"" I know what I was talking about when I said this, before someone comments No, they all have accounts created to keep them in a few years

Maybe I was an idiot when I told them that when I was still grieving for the loss of their mother, but now all my family except my parents are confirming that I was and saying that I should transfer half of the inheritance and that they resolve

i think i may be on my way to having a just no mil,"my boyfriend and i are still young (20), but we‚Äôve been talking about our futures and what we see for ourselves. we really bonded and understand each other so we would like to take things to the next level and move in together as soon as we‚Äôre financially able to and continue on from there. 

the issue comes in with his mom, his family also has an issue with his mom, including his brother in law. his mom constantly guilts him, his sister, and his father. for some odd reason, no one is allowed to go anywhere without telling her or asking if she would like to go along, even including his sister at times who no longer lives with them. any time his dad goes to even appointments for the dentist or doctor, she has to be asked if she wants to go‚Äîwhich she does, and will sit in a hot car with a broken ac because she can‚Äôt go inside due to covid. when my bf told me his mom was sitting in a car in the hot weather just because she wants to be out where everyone goes, i thought it was really ridiculous.

i have issues with the way his mom treats her family as a whole, but i obviously have a bias with my bf. a while ago, his sister confided in him that their mom was not too happy about him going out so much to see me. i admit, he does/did go out a lot during the beginning of our relationship, but i think it‚Äôs normal when you first really click with someone to want to be with them often. the problem she had was that he didn‚Äôt spend enough time with her, but when he tries she pulls out all her guilting and defensive mechanisms which makes him regret even trying to be with her. she also is rarely home since she likes to be with her friends more than being at home, which begs the question, if you really want to spend time with him so much, why are you never home? 

my bf then told me while he was telling me about this, his mom would get extremely offended he didn‚Äôt offer her to go with him to see me during the beginning of our relationship. what would you expect to be able to do with teenagers at their house or on a date? we were only 18/19, were still young now, what did she expect to do? him telling me this bothered me a lot, it didn‚Äôt sit well with me his mom wanted to force herself in our relationship. i don‚Äôt understand why she was obsessed and pushy with him getting a girlfriend since he was 16/17 if she can‚Äôt handle him being independent and devoting his time to someone else. 

i already have some feelings against her due to other things he‚Äôs told me, her entire family hates the way she is, so i‚Äôm not worried about my bf having hard feelings about me not liking her because he understands and feels the same. he‚Äôs willing to stand up for me if something ever were to happen. i love him a lot and i‚Äôm just worried i won‚Äôt be able to keep my cool",JUSTNOMIL,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/pdy7mr/i_think_i_may_be_on_my_way_to_having_a_just_no_mil/,RANT (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª Advice Wanted,halloween13e,pdy7mr,/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/pdy7mr/i_think_i_may_be_on_my_way_to_having_a_just_no_mil/,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/pdy7mr/i_think_i_may_be_on_my_way_to_having_a_just_no_mil/,8,2021-08-29
I [27f] met someone [27m] who I really like on vacation in another city and I'm not sure what to do next?,"I was on a girls trip 4 hours (by plane) from home - West Coast to Midwest. We went to a bar and this cute guy came up to me, we chatted, he got my # and texted me the next day asking if I wanted to get drinks. My friend was doing drinks with a guy she met at a bars, so I agreed to do a happy hour with this guy. We decided ahead of time we'd invite our dates to dinner if they seemed cool. We had a couple of drinks and a great conversation (plus I did not remember him being that hot.) I invited him to dinner with my friend (who didn't invite her date because she said he was weird) and he was so nice and paid although I offered to Venmo. Then we went out to a couple of bars and caught some live music together.


Towards the end of the night, my friend went to our hotel and he &amp; I chilled at the bar. He said some sweet stuff like he was really nervous to approach me but glad he did. At some point, past relationships came up and he mentioned he'd dated a girl for years a while back and I said I'd had a long term relationship a while ago. He said he doesn't just usually go up to girls and ask for their numbers and asked his friends what to say to me in the first text. He invited me back to his place and we hooked up. This is my first vacation hookup but I figured have a good time, live it up. We cuddled for a while and he walked me to my hotel early in the AM. He said he wanted to visit me as he's never been to where I live and he's been meaning to check it out. He asked for my social media and said he loved spending time and all these sweet compliments. 

It's been about three weeks and we text everyday, Snapchat each other and send each other memes on IG. He asked me how long the flight is and what airlines go direct, but he hasn't booked anything or talked dates. We normally talk about our day or getting to know you type stuff, but he told me he really liked me and hasn't felt this way in a while. I feel like if this was just gonna be a one night vacation hookup, the easiest to end it is just when I left, but talking with him regularly and knowing how strong that connection was, I'm into him, but I don't want to get hurt if there's zero chance of us seeing each other again. I think we are different in our approach to planning...he is an artist and I am an accountant, I like having a plan and he seems more spontaneous. My friend pointed out he may be trying to get to know me more before he commits to visiting which is a bigger thing (time off since he's in and out of galleries in-person, plane costs, etc.)

Should I ask him if he wants to Facetime? I don't want to come off as crazy or I'm pressuring him into visiting, but I also don't want to get too invested emotionally if there is no potential? I've dated casually a bit (in the context of COVID lol) but I honestly haven't felt such a strong connection or interest in someone in a while but I also understand what's next feels unclear. Advice??

Males with strict parents,"Sorry for the rant, I would just like some adviceand understanding if Im in the wrong here.

Anybody as a guy ever have parents who were to strict for no reason. I was judged ridiculed and laughed as a child. I was rarely ever to stay at a friends house because there paremts, ""wouldn't want me there"" As a teen, I wasn't able to go out because I would cause trouble even when I had done nothing wrong. I couldnt even stay out past a certain time because it was ""too dangerous"". needless to say we lived in a really small town where nothing ever happened. I rebeled and got into the wrong crowd. My parents would go put of their way and follow me and give me cerfews even when I had girlfriends even after highschool. I couldnt stay up out later than 11:30 because I would keep them up and they would worry that something would happen to me. Like I said we live in a town where at the time nothing ever happened. I was constantly provoked to anger 

I did some reckless things over the course of the years due to anger but have calmed down quite alot. 

Recently Im starting to hear of the stories they used to do when they were young and all the fun times they had. They werent wild but the opportunities for enjoy ment and freedom in Mexico were far greater than what I had here in America.(the reason they moved here was to give themselves and there family a beter life.) Ive been at home all my life and ive been living here recently due to saving up money and trying to prepare myself for my future. 

They laugh at all the jokes other people say nowadays that they would never allow me to get away with. They always wonder why im so serious or never laugh when I would joke that way I would get punished. it brings back resentment whenever I come across these thing and im tired of feeling this way. I know moving out is one way to go but for now I have to suck it up and focus on the betterment of my future. 

Theyve calm down mostly due to the fact that I dont tolerate anymore disrespect and theyve kind of had a hard time adjusting to that. I also sense a dislike from my mother ever since I stood up to my uncle about how unfairly he treated me. Like i broke the family up but it was for the sake of my sanity.

I could go on and on but I just would like to here your opinions on what you think and how I can over come this nuisance. 

im sorry if this is all over the place but that how my mind feels some of the time these past couple day, which is better cause it used to be an everyday thing.",Advice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pe1uu8/males_with_strict_parents/,,Fantastic-Squash-158,pe1uu8,/r/Advice/comments/pe1uu8/males_with_strict_parents/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/pe1uu8/males_with_strict_parents/,1,2021-08-29
Considering giving DMT another go.,"Would welcome opinions on this: 
I'm a mature (40's) psychedelic user with several years of  fairly regular LSD usage at doses up to 350ug but most commonly at 250ug as I find I enjoy at this dose being able to go in and out of a deeper experience at will and by vaping weed.
I've also tried 4-ACO-DMT 3 times, twice at threshold first which was just unpleasant and physically uncomfortable and once at 'fuck it not sure how much that is but it looks like more than enough' very impulsive dose, which was a beautiful experience during which I had the greatest degree of ego dissolution with eyes open that I've ever had, and was similar yet different to high dose LSD.
I've also recently grown, dried and powdered my own cubensis, and tried 1.7g lemon tekked which was similar to my low dose 4-ACO-DMT - unpleasant and physically uncomfortable, very threshold psychedelic.
So I guess I've developed a slight anxiety towards tryptamines, and a high degree of trust and comfort with LSD at the doses I take.
I enjoy tripping alone, and as a highly sensitive person like to be highly physically comfortable and that means wearing my pyjama bottoms and having my favourite bean bag handy! 
I'm type1 diabetic so although I was really interested in a 'heroic dose' experience I need to be able to control my blood sugars and I did consider a sitter but ultimately I don't have anyone I feel comfortable enough with who has the time available so I stay where I am.
However, a couple of years ago I was fascinated and also slightly scared by the DMT experience, and found myself with a group of like-minded individuals (joined a local psychedelic group) on a camping trip and decided on the spare of the moment to try DMT.
Despite all I know about set and setting, which were all wrong - I had made the decision before attending not to do DMT so I was mentally unprepared, I met many of the other folks there that evening, I was socially a bit anxious, very aware that I lean more towards physical explanations of the psychedelic experience (although ultimately agnostic) than was typical within the group and feel this is probably the case on this subreddit too? and I chose the music to put on my headphones going in quickly and terribly (picked a track called 'Awe' by Roger Gouda from a playlist based on title alone; I'm sure it added to the experience in a negative way).
 Despite all the above a single thought that this may be my only opportunity to have a DMT breakthrough or at least significant experience with someone there to take the pipe and ensure my physical safety, made my ADHD impulsivity decide to go for it, and 2 minutes later I'm inhaling 35mg and holding my breath determined to blast off as high as possible.
I had asked for 50mg as I felt I may only do this once, because I definitely had fear and anxiety going in (great start huh?)
I didn't get to take a 2nd or third hit, in fact I vaguely remember an anxiety about not having breathed out yet as I ceased to exist.
So I didn't break through, my ego dissolved and awareness was just some floating Jigsaw piece type shapes in front of the ""visual' field in a flat yet wavy plane, with a feeling of pure anxiety colouring the experience. 
As part of me started to re-emerge I had a feeling of grasping for a memory of something vague, which eventually became the memory to let go and accept in order to release myself into the experience. Regrettably it wasn't possible to 'remember' this when it would have been useful as there was no me, words or memories, and by the time those things existed the experience was ending.
I smiled coming out of it, and everyone assumed I'd had a great experience but actually I was just glad to exist again, similar to Michael Pollan's 5-MEO experience for those that have read his book.
So, this wasn't traumatising, I would describe it as difficult and I'm not someone who would wish to repeat it, I'm in awe of those who accept this more willingly than me. I decided i would never do DMT again.
It was, however, useful. 
Until then I had been hyperfocussing on trying to be more aware of my ego and act in a less egoic way to the point of telling myself that the ego is somehow a bad thing. 
This experience made me glad to have an ego, recognise that although it can cause problems by trying to defend itself and me too quickly, I made peace with my ego and stopped idealising destroying it completely, I learned that there's nothing wrong with enjoying my LSD experiences at a very manageable (for me) 225ug rather than seeking to go higher each time. 
However, I'm considering using DMT again at much lower doses. 
I've acquired a dab rig, and would like to use at a low enough dose that I could safely or relatively safely experiment at home, alone and still be able to put the rig down without risk of breaking or burning.
I don't smoke, so the idea of changa is probably out, I could research and create a vape cart but I have the dab rig so that's what I'm interested in feedback on.
It's this feasible? Would be lovely to be able to have a lower level psychedelic experience without having 2 days available.
Also if you get the temperature right how bad is the smell? 
The smell/taste of my experience in the (big) tent infiltrated my nostrils for days or at least seemed to, despite the person who was kindly sharing the substance having some expensive type of pipe or contraption that 'guaranteed' no burning of DMT, I watched others and there was a lot of smoke or vapour.

The Devil You Know,"When I was a young man, I was abducted by a UFO. That‚Äôs not wholly true, though. It wasn‚Äôt an unidentified flying object, because I knew exactly what it was. Or at least, I did when they explained it to me. The Greys, that is. They had me on an auxiliary research ship. This information wasn‚Äôt beamed into my head like in all those stereotypical UFO abduction stories. The Greys talk with their small mouths just like you and me, though they use a translator accessory around their neck.

They look exactly how you would expect. Grey skin. Big, black eyes. Bulbous head, small body. Long, spindly fingers. Just like in the movies. It was almost funny to me when I first saw them, but the fact that they were real only made it terrifying.

They captured me for the same reason a human biologist would capture a wild animal. To tag it, and release it. They said they would be keeping tabs on me for the rest of my life, and wouldn‚Äôt contact me after they put a tracker inside me. And that‚Äôs what they did. I saw them load what looked like a metal pill into a massive syringe. The needle became red hot, seemingly by itself, and they injected it into the base of the back of my skull, where my spinal cord met my brain. The pain was searing, and tears were squeezed out of my squinting eyes. They then told me that if I tried to remove whatever they put inside me, it would paralyze me before the signal from my brain made it to my hands. In other words, I wasn‚Äôt going to be able to touch it, or even be able to tell anyone about it. These *things* were literally in my head.

Then they spit me out where they found me. I was back in the corn field where I always got blasted after work. I never saw the ship that took me, before or after the encounter. I just appeared wherever they wanted me to appear. I felt like a damn housepet, being moved from one room to another against their will. But after that, for the most part, my life was pretty normal. I never forgot that day, and whenever I tried to tell someone about what happened, they‚Äôd dismiss it as a drunken nightmare or an elaborate joke. So eventually I just stopped telling people. 

The incident inspired me to get into engineering, and after many years I got a job as a roboticist for a commercial space company. My work was going to be on the first commercial mining operation on an asteroid, which guaranteed my silence about my encounter, for fear of jeopardizing that achievement.

However, I did seek out others like me online. I found many people who were obviously either mentally ill or just trolling. They weren‚Äôt genuine. But I did enough searching to find a few folks who I believed had encounters with the same Greys I did. I even became friends with a few of them. That was, until *that day*. 

On the day we made first contact, I had my phone, tv, desktop and laptop all playing different sources‚Äô coverage of the event. A gargantuan horseshoe-shaped mothership appeared in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, and cut a whole in the clouds above Tokyo, Japan. At the same time, there were dozens of smaller ships doing the same in many major cities around the world. The alien ships across the planet then broadcast an audio message simultaneously, announcing that they were here in peace and that they were here to share their technologies with us.

When they emerged from their ships, my heart dropped. I was expecting to see the Greys. I‚Äôd never seen these things before. They looked just like humans, but instead of hair, deerlike antlers adorning their heads like crowns. The closeups from the news coverage also showed that their eyes were inhumanly far apart and had sideways irises, like those of a goat or sheep. This gave them the believable air of gentleness that would be our downfall.

I knew something was off, and I turned to my online inner circle to see what they made of it. But I couldn‚Äôt get in touch with any of them, no matter how I tried. This whole situation wasn‚Äôt right. But for the time being, there was nothing I could do about any of it. So I just kept a close eye on the developments that came in the following months.

The aliens called themselves Shikans. The relatively small group that made up the Shikan outreach program quickly became the most famous celebrities in the history of Earth, and they weren‚Äôt even human. They held lectures at universities, held press conferences, even held public forums that would fill stadiums, where they would educate the people of Earth about all kinds of topics, including themselves.

I attended several of these events, and when they never once mentioned the Greys, even during their multi-hour Q&amp;A sessions, I knew they were lying about their motivations. They claimed to be the only other sapient species in our arm of the galaxy, which I knew was untrue because the Greys said they were from our local interstellar cloud, within 30 lightyears of us.

Then the Shikans created these tremendous structures, seemingly out of nothing, that hung in the sky like magic. They called them ‚ÄúShikan Cultural and Scientific Scholarship Centers.‚Äù These pop-up buildings were literally skyscrapers, disrupting the movement of clouds due to their enormity and placement in the air. There were thousands of them. They were also filled to the brim with accommodations for anyone who wanted to learn about Shikans and their way of life. They would have a place to stay, food and medicine all for free. 

When people started moving into these centers permanently, my initial skepticism became my motivation to try and keep people away from them. I told all my friends and family, anyone who would listen, that these things were not to be trusted, no matter how benevolent they may seem. I was dismissed pretty quickly when it became apparent that their ‚Äúgenerosity‚Äù with their tech was helping people all over the world. They healed the sick, they fed the hungry, and they even negotiated the end of multiple human wars. I still didn‚Äôt trust them as far as I could throw their ships. 

Then people started worshipping the Shikans like deities themselves. The part that confirmed my suspicions is when they didn‚Äôt stop their worshippers. They embraced them, encouraged them, even. It was clear to me that there were more nefarious machinations at work. World governments were, in classic government form, being far too slow in their responses to this gradual, growing invasion. There was nothing I could do to stop my world from being taken from me in front of my very eyes.

After researching every one of them as much as I could, I discovered that the ‚Äúscholarship centers,‚Äù which had basically become church communes at that point, were placed in such a way to form two overlapping rings that wrapped around the planet. I didn‚Äôt know what this meant, but it was ominous enough to me that I immediately reported it to the Department of Homeland Security. Not that I thought they would be able to do anything with this discovery.

I was awoken one night by a shining blue-white light shining in the window, filling my bedroom and wrapping its warmth around me. It was as if the light was physically touching me. This was a vaguely familiar feeling, but one I couldn‚Äôt place. The light fully enveloped me, blinding me to the point where I couldn‚Äôt see my room around me.

I woke up in a standing position, in the same ship I found myself in all those years ago. Only this time, I wasn‚Äôt alone. I looked around to find that I was in the same large room with about 500 other people, all just as confused as I was. I recognized some of them as my online alien abductee friends that went missing. Before any of us could speak, a voice boomed throughout the ship.

‚ÄúHello, humans. You may or may not remember us, however it is of no matter if you do not.‚Äù The voice was the same robotic monotone that came from the translators the Greys used before, ‚ÄúWe have spent months gathering you all here away from the gaze of the ones you know as the Shikans. We are here to make you an offer. We told you before that we would never contact you again, however recent events on your planet have caused us to reconsider this protocol. Your planet is in imminent danger, and will cease to exist in our universe within the next 48 of your hours. In an effort to save our research subjects, we offer you refuge aboard our ship. If you have any questions, ask them now.‚Äù

Naturally, we all had a million questions. Yet no one spoke, either in shock from being back on the Greys‚Äô ship, or from the gravity of the apocalyptic message we were just given. A woman not far from me broke the silence, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòcease to exist in our universe‚Äô? What‚Äôs going to happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe believe that the beings that recently colonized your world are from another universe, and they have somehow crossed over into our own. The spires that they have erected around your planet are pieces of a larger device, meant to switch your planet with another. We assume that they are planning to put their home planet, as well as the remainder of their population,  in Earth‚Äôs current position around your star. Earth will be transported to their homeworld‚Äôs position in its universe of origin, of which we have no knowledge.‚Äù

Again, stunned silence. The voice on the intercom continued, ‚ÄúYou are free to choose to stay on Earth with your loved ones, or you can come with us now. We will transport you to the nearest habitable planet, and provide you with protection from foreign pathogens. While we will give you the tools to rebuild your civilization, we will not do it for you. You must work together to survive. It will be a life of labor. But your species will be saved from extinction, and our research will be allowed to continue, albeit under different circumstances.‚Äù

None of us had any more questions. The silence that followed the Grey‚Äôs speech had a different feeling. It was heavier, thicker. Like a brick wall was just built around each of us. There was nothing left to say. When faced with the end of the world, what can you say? 

I don‚Äôt know what was going through the heads of my fellow guinea pigs, but for me the answer here was simple. It was still devastating, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I had to leave my family and friends behind with the knowledge that they would most likely be killed soon. Who knows what was waiting for them in that other universe? The Shikans were running from something. Something so terrifying, so destructive, that they had to escape from their own *universe.* Again, the choice for me was clear.

Though I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure I could trust the Greys either. I had just been lied to by a group of aliens, who knew if they were being honest about their plans. They could easily take us and experiment on us in perpetuity, which could be a fate worse than death. But if they were going to do that, why would they give us a choice? 

So that brings us to now. I have to give the Greys my final decision. These beings have never respected me, they‚Äôve treated me as a specimen to be observed like an animal in the zoo and it appeared they intended to continue this way. But, to their credit, they kept their promise not to bother me until the Shikans arrived. So, on this incredibly thin suggestion of honesty, I‚Äôm going to put my life in the hands of the Greys. 

After all, better the devil you know than the devil you don‚Äôt.

Should I Be Concerned That My Boyfriend Doesn't Miss Me," 

I (F20) and my boyfriend (M20) have been together since 8th grade. Recently, we both started school for the fall semester, our colleges being 4 hours away from each other. I was excited for him last year when he was accepted into this program but spent the next couple months trying to internally figure out how our relationship will change with our new distance. For 6 years we haven't lived further than 10 minutes from each other. That being said, we aren't the kind of couple that is extremely attached at the hip. Even at such a young age we realized that relationships where the two are completely intertwined are unhealthy, we have always been two individuals together. Until this point, we have both been very independent people. But I am not so sure about myself anymore.

We are currently 2 months into our long distance relationship. I have had the worst summer of my life, not because of our distance but this certainly has not helped. To make a long story short, I have depression and anxiety and was diagnosed at 9. I've been on various medications since. That being said, my medication doesn't block all bad feelings. If anything, I have learned over time that feelings my meds can't help usually turn out to be very valid and hold some intuition behind them.

He has made an effort to come home occasionally to see me and his family. When he is here, I feel as though nothing has changed. But when he's gone, I basically feel like I don't even have a boyfriend. When he first moved, we texted, facetimed, called etc very regularly. He made a great effort to reach out. However, I get the vibe that he is having a great time without me. Nowadays, he's short with me and doesn't seem too interested. He recently got a new job down where he is living that is having him stay down there on weekends. It wasn't supposed to be like this initially, it was going to be a weekend here and there. It has turned into an every weekend thing. I feel like it's been forever since I have seen him or even had a full conversation with him. I worry because I can not get the feeling that he feels the same way, because of how he's acted over the phone. I feel like he doesn't miss me.

While there is no doubt in my mind that he is completely faithful to me, I still can't shake the feeling that he doesn't want to be with me anymore. I can only think of a few occasions where I have actually stated my feelings about missing him and being sad out there, but he changed the topic or ended the conversation shortly after saying he had to go do something. He completely shut me down.

I have never known my boyfriend to be too much of an emotional person, but I'm certain in the 6 years we have been together I have never witnessed him be so cold. I know many couples decide to end the relationship over distance, especially those that are college age. But I assumed him and I were different. We have been together with minimal fights and no break ups since middle school. I genuinely thought that what we had was something other than the norm and we would be able to get through this just fine. I'm now having doubts we will even last until Christmas break.

I'm still completely in love with him, and I'm 99% sure he is too. But the change in his personality has been unable to leave my mind. Am I crazy? Could it be my mental illness? Is this valid? Am I an ass for feeling like my boyfriend should miss me more?

WIBTA if I didn't let my grandma move in with me and my boyfriend?,"The whole situation is very complicated but I'll try to be concise.

The context:

I (20F) moved to a big city about six hours away from my hometown for uni a year ago. My flatmate (32M) and I began dating a few months into living together and are now in a committed relationship.

I have a very strained relationship with my parents; they don't support me financially. All the money that I get comes from my grandma (67F) who works as a carer for wealthy elderly people. She goes abroad for six weeks at a time and then she's home for six weeks. Her and my grandpa have been married forty five years and have grown to despise each other.

The situation:

Grandma wants to leave grandpa and move away. I support her decision to do so because it would benefit her mental health a lot. The thing is, she wants me and my partner to move to a bigger apartment so she can move in with us. She says she'd just let us be and not be in our way but I know my grandma - she's very confrontational and very controlling and everything has to be done a certain way. I don't think I could peacefully live with her and I don't expect my partner to put up with it. I also don't think I could comfortably be affectionate with my partner in a living situation like that. I feel genuinely horrible turning her down because she's the only one supporting me, financially and emotionally as well, but I don't think I could ever be happy living with her because we're such different people. She says she'll figure something else out and still move out if I say no.

So, would I be the asshole if I did say no?",AmItheAsshole,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pe3142/wibta_if_i_didnt_let_my_grandma_move_in_with_me/,,barelydemon,pe3142,/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pe3142/wibta_if_i_didnt_let_my_grandma_move_in_with_me/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pe3142/wibta_if_i_didnt_let_my_grandma_move_in_with_me/,15,2021-08-29
I'm about to give up on my relationship but I don't want to at the same time.,"Me (M23) and my girlfriend (F20) have been dating for almost 3 years now and we have lived together on our own for almost a year now. I don't know what to do anymore. She is a good person but she doesn't ever want to communicate and I hate to say she doesn't want to help out when it comes to our living situation. 

We have a very expensive apartment in our town because she refused to live anywhere else. She grew up upper class and I grew up not necessarily poor but I wouldn't even consider middle class, so she is really weird about having to have the best things and always being in the nicest of places when it comes to homes and vehicles and such. When moved in together we agreed to split the rent to be fair to both of us but I have had to pay for everything since we have moved in. She says she doesn't make the money I make so it's not fair she should have to pay for rent when I make the most money, but my issue with that and I have brought this up with no effect, is she doesn't work more than 10-15 hours a week if she goes to work that week meanwhile I am literally having to work 2 full time jobs just so we can have money to live on. I end up having to help her make her car payments every once in awhile and I have to give her money every week and pay for her gas. I have asked her time and time again to help me out because working nearly 18 hours a day is taking it's tole on my physical and mental health. She always get mad at me and turns on me and makes it my fault saying I should be better with my money and we wouldn't be in the situation. She is all the time going out with friends and getting her hair and nails done which I have no issues with at all and I would never have but it bothers me she can't pay her way for anything and it causes me to have struggle 24/7 to make sure we have everything we need to live our lives. I could almost be ok with me working and her not but I have to come home and make food for us everyday even after getting off both of my jobs and the apartment is always a huge mess, trash, dirty laundry, the dogs we have will have poop and pee all in the house for me to clean up everything is always a wreck. I have to spend any days I have off which only come once and two weeks deep cleaning and doing laundry. I'm not one for old time gender rolls but I feel like this is a little different. I could go on longer but I will leave it at that

When we try to talk about our issues it always ends up with me apologizing to her. I'll bring up an issue and it's always gets thrown back into my face. So now I'm at the point where I don't says anything anymore because I'm afraid of just getting my feelings hurt whenever I bring up an issue, and I can't deal with the stress of her being mad at me. For instance I had an issue with her not taking the dogs out for me after I had surgery a few month back. I am always very nice when I ask for her to do anything and she went off on me because and this is her words "" I do to much around here for you to be asking anything of me"" and than she threaten to leave.

I am not perfect by no means I have had my fair share of screw ups in the relationship. I don't want to just give up on our relationship because I really do love her and care for her more than anyone but I just don't know if I can keep going on like this. I wish I could give y'all her side of the story but if she found this post it would be game over. At the end of the day I guess im just scared I don't know just please give me some advice

Vocal recording setup,"I'm starting to record some vocals at home and I have some questions about the setup.

My equipment: Focusrite Scarlett 8i6 3rd gen audio interface, Rode NT2A condenser microphone, Bitwig Studio 4 DAW (running on Ubuntu 20.04) and JACK2 audio server. My room is untreated (unfortunately, not practical) and there is some background noise like PC's fans, but not a lot.

Right now I have no idea what I'm doing. I tried to record a test track, all I did was just turn the gain to halfway on my Scarlett. It sounds OK, but only after I crank up dBs on my DAW by like 20 or so, otherwise it's way too quiet. There was less background noise than I expected, but still I'd like some ideas on how to keep it to minimum with what equipment I have.

My main question is about input sensitivity. The track on my DAW is by default set to -10 dB, which I assume is fine? My mic has 0 dB, -5 dB and -10 dB setting, which one should I choose? And last but not least, the gain knob on the interface, what should that be set to?

The microphone is set to cardioid mode and high pass filter is set to 80 Hz if that matters.",audioengineering,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/pduua5/vocal_recording_setup/,,CodeDominator,pduua5,/r/audioengineering/comments/pduua5/vocal_recording_setup/,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/pduua5/vocal_recording_setup/,20,2021-08-29

I can't get my friend out of my life and I don't feel comfortable with her,"Sorry, this is long. I'm partially venting.

I have told her and blocked her several times but she just doesn't get the message. I don't want her in my life. The last time I blocked her, she told a mutual friend that I'm ""just being an introvert"" and then bought tickets for us for some show. I don't know how to tell her I don't want to go, especially not with her. 

I don't want to hang out with her. I don't want to have her in my life. I'm sick of her going around singing like a canary about all my secrets when I've specifically told her not to. I feel like every time I try to cut her out of my life, she just gaslights me. She will imply that there's something wrong with me like I'm having bad mental health if I try to get away from her. I feel like she learned that trick from my ex boyfriend. 

She's always referencing my ""problems"" in front of other people and never in private. Every time I talk to her she goes on and on about ""this person said that about you and that other person said this"" and it's always drama I've long forgotten about that she's digging up and it makes me anxious because I don't want anything to do with it. Is she waiting on my reaction so she can go tell them what I said? 

I know that in the past she has dragged people through the mud after their friendship ended and honestly I just don't have the energy for that shit. I've tried to explain to her that I'm really not interested in drama like that as I just want to grow up but she doesn't understand at all. I'm starting to think there's a massive gap in maturity between us but she's also very manipulative and uses me. 

Sometimes she cries to get me to give her things. Here's a good example of her manipulative behaviour:

This one time we were on our way to a 4 day music festival and she started crying that she had no money. I had brought $200 with me. She payed for the tickets so I was like ""chill, take this $100 and have a good time"", so she takes it. The next day ALL of my money was gone even though I hadn't touched it. I asked her ""where's the money?"" and she immediately threw a tantrum. She said it was ""my tone"" and began taking all of my things and throwing them out of her car and telling me I can find my own way home. We were in the middle of nowhere. 

She then proceeded to accuse me (loudly in front of people) of using her to get a ticket to the festival. I was pissed off because I didn't even want to go to the damn festival and I was having a terrible time. I only went because she begged me to. Anyway, it turned out that she took all of my money as well as hers and spent all of the money on cocaine. She said she got ""a good deal"" on at least $300 worth of cocaine and I can sell it. I asked her wtf she was thinking because; 

A - I am not a drug dealer and

B - I do not have the social skills to be a drug dealer

C - I don't even like cocaine, which makes it completely useless to me. How am I supposed to sell something like that? ""Would you like some of this? I fucking hate it but you might have a sick one""

Yeah that's gonna work.

She implied that I should be grateful and I somehow ended up apologizing for asking about my money????? Long story short I didn't eat for that entire festival and suffered heatstroke on the third day because I couldn't buy a bottle to carry water in and the only source of running water was miles away in 45 degree (celsius) heat. Obviously I assumed I would have money as I took money with me and I didn't bother to buy a bottle before we left. My bad. She ended up driving me home after I crawled up her arse begging her not to leave me in the middle of nowhere. 

So not only is my money not mine, I'm not allowed to ask about it if it goes missing either? That makes me a horrible person? Was I supposed to see it gone and just think ""oh, that's fine""? I honestly don't care about my ""tone"". Anyone would have been confused and annoyed if they woke up at a festival and all their money was gone. I had that tone because she's done things like this before and she knows it. 

Anyway, that's just one example. I could go on and on for days but this is already getting too long.

Being Forced to Break NC to Say Goodbye to Sick Grandma. Advice requested.,"NC with NParents for almost 7 mos, and have no real desire to resume any level of contact with them. However, my maternal grandmother is the ONLY positive relationship I had during my childhood (I love her with all my heart), and she is currently quite sick with a stomach abscess + has already had dementia for years. My husband, son and I are moving 1000mi away immediately after Labor Day, so I fear this is my last opportunity to ever see her. 

My Grandma was released from the hospital on Friday on a new antibacterial cocktail that her doctor's are hoping resolves the abscess. Otherwise, they don't feel she's strong enough to operate, and the path from here (if the meds don't work) sounds bleak. I've spoken directly with my Grandmother's personal nurse about the situation, so this isn't third-party info from N's or flying monkeys -- I've confirmed her health is deeply compromised. My Grandma only has a landline + flip phone (no internet/computer either), so I don't even have a way of Facetiming her. And like my N's, I have not seen her since early March.

So. My NParents are bringing her to me tomorrow. I broke NC with a simple joint text: *""I heard Grandma was released from the hospital, and I would like to see her and have her spend time with {son's name}. Would you bring her into the city on Monday so that she can see us? You can spend time in the park with {son's name} and his nanny, and I'll be in attendance as my work schedule allows"".* They responded yes. My husband will also be coming.

I'm self aware enough to know I'm going to be triggered by the inevitable gas-lighting, guilt-tripping, and love-bombing my N's will attempt to leverage to weasel their way ""back in"" to my life. They are aware we are moving and know the state, but do not know our moving date or our new address -- I will not be disclosing this info tomorrow. I plan, as much as possible, to simply focus on my grandma, spend an hour with her and my son together (my nanny and Nparents will also be there, we're meeting at a public park) and then return home to continue my workday. I'm nervous, and already a bit emotionally drained, but I know I need to do this for my Grandma.

Any advice would be deeply appreciated. As soon as my hourlong time with them is complete, I'll be returning the #'s back to blocked, and NC will resume.",raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/pe4dy4/being_forced_to_break_nc_to_say_goodbye_to_sick/,[Advice Request],tipsygirrrl,pe4dy4,/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/pe4dy4/being_forced_to_break_nc_to_say_goodbye_to_sick/,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/pe4dy4/being_forced_to_break_nc_to_say_goodbye_to_sick/,4,2021-08-29
Nothing But Respect,"I just need to take the time to say this, I have nothing but respect for you Kiwis. The way y'all have all made the commitment to keeping COVID out of your country is unbelievable. The fact that dam near everyone is willing to make the effort, when COVID does arise, to stay home for a while so it can not further spread. How you guys use being on an island to your advantage. Literally everything you guys are doing I can not be more impressed. 

I am from the States where COVID is running rampant, vaccines are free to all, where those who want them have already gotten them, and those who don't are still refusing. Where thousands are dying on the daily, where people are losing loved ones for reasons preventable.

"Yellow Jackets, again. Locating techniques?","We had three large underground yellow jacket nests when we first moved into our house two years ago.  We tried a bunch of the home remedy type techniques to get rid of them as well as foaming spray to no avail.  Finally I made a borax and simple syrup slurry and poured it down the holes into the nests.  They were all wiped out within a week.  

But now we have had them buzzing around all summer and we cannot find where they are coming from.  Every time I grill outside, here they come like I invited them for dinner.  

If we could locate the hives, I would just go with the borax slurry treatment again.  

Since we can't find the little bastards, does anyone have a way of sending these scouts back home with some poison doggy bags?

Helping other married guys cheat,"I've been enjoying posts on here and I've definitely found my tribe, so I thought I'll start sharing some of my experiences from over the years. And there are tons... lol. Every post of mine will be 100% true. Honestly, I'm half doing this just remember how many guys I've played with and half to turn on kindred spirits. 

To start, I'm a 43 year old married, gay, psychological dom top. My husband is 52, top vers, and over the years is more and more into watching me fuck and cuck scenarios. We're both 6'2"", nice cocks (7.5"" and thick), and in decent shape. We've been together since I was 19, we're into playing with others (together or not), and we're both cheaters. (More on that another  time - just caught him the other day. LOL) I guess we're kind of open, especially when I'm sending regulars over to get fucked while I'm on vacation this weekend. ;) We're also completely in love after all these years and have fantastic sex. But, sometimes (always...) a man needs to fuck, not make love, and that's why this group exists. 

So, this experience isn't about my cheating, but getting others to do it. Like a lot of cheaters, I love the thrill of the hunt, the conquest, and (usually) getting away with it. But more than that, I love getting married guys beneath me. It's a fucking artform and so hot - and rewarding. We have several married guys, gay and straight, in our harem of regular fuck buddies. Once they're hooked, they're all in. ""Hooked on cock works for *me*."" And with the straight guys, teaming up with my husband is magic. They're thinking, ""they're married, so they're not fucking around (Hahahahaha) and won't give me anything (true)"" and condoms disappear in no time. (The gay ones require zero assurances before taking loads.) 

So, this past Tuesday night we were both kind of horny and took to the apps to see who was looking. A chubby gay ginger that we previously hooked up with shot me a message. We both fucked him in a three-way, but my husband wrote him off. He's into in shape guys; I'm into most anyone I can use. Since then, I've railed the ginger a few times while my husband was at work and sent him off with loads in his hole. He loves taking my thick cock and I love getting some on the sly. Didn't know he'd gotten married since then, but once I did it was game on.

It was getting late-ish and a work night, so I got to work fast. Started some playful banter, sent a couple cock pics, and got him good and worked up. He whined that he didn't know how to get out of the house, so I kindly suggested that he go ""run some errands."" He was hesitant, but I like to get what I want. After a couple more cock pics, he made the fatal comment: ""You have no idea how badly I want to go behind [his husband's] back!"" I reminded him how badly he needed a real cock inside him and how hot it would be ""to cuck that fucking bitch."" I told him that if his husband was on the app, I'd fuck him, too, just to send ginger the pics. (Really, I would.) Finally, I reminded him it was late and his ""last chance to cheat on him with the both of us. "" Hook. Line. Sinker.  ""Remind me of your address (Oops... don't show my hubby that one. LOL). I'll be there in 10 minutes.""

Less than 10 minutes later, we had a surprise at the door. Chubby ginger is now Toned ginger. Like myself, he slimmed down during the pandemic. And daaamn... We got right down to business long before getting to the  bedroom... pulling his shirt off, rubbing his new, fuzzy abs and chest, praising the effort he put into getting in shape, and watching him lap up the praise like a kitten with a saucer of cream. It's like tuning an instrument for a performance. I bent him over the back of the sofa and ripped down his shorts to get a better look at his nice, firm, lightly-haired ass cheeks.  They're phenomenal, and I let him know it. I gave each one a few hard squeezes before spanking him with a hard CRACK. He moaned like crazy. The boy was worked up good.

We took him back to my bedroom and pushed him on his knees. He absolutely devoured our cocks. Gotta love a hungry cocksucker... I enjoyed slamming the back of his throat and all the spit his choking produced. If he wasn't so tight, I'd have let that be his only lube, but I'm not a complete monster.  (Read: maybe next time.) After a good while, we hoisted him up. I sat against the headboard and ginger dutifully climbed up and went back to work while the hubby lubed up his hole. A look let me know that hubby wasn't in a mood to be gentle, so I hooked my knee around the back of ginger's head as hubby plunged in. The little cheating whore didn't whine; just more moaning. It was incredibly hot. Hubby was wanting to get to bed and was turned off by our trick's keto breath, so he fucked to dump and go. (Seriously, keto dieters, a breath mint or sugar free gum goes a long way.) He dumped his load with a grunt and climbed off to clean up and sleep. 

I straddlled the ginger and thought again about going in with leftover spit, but I spotted his wedding band and was struck with sudden inspiration. I laid over him and slid my cock up and down his crack while telling him was a disgusting cheating fucker he is and nibbling on his neck and ears. Then I slid his ring off his finger and put it on my own index finger, and I swear he shuddered. He was fully committed to the fuck. I drizzled some lube in his crack and slid the finger with his wedding band into his hole, making sure he felt that metal ring that made him a husband pop in and  out of the flesh ring that I was owning. I told him it would be a pity if it slipped off and I had to fuck it into him. Hehehe... What would his husband say?

I was too turned on by my own teasing, so I finally forced apart his knees with mine, slipped the head of my cock in, and dropped my full weight on him as I drove in. I wrapped my arm with the wedding band around his neck and pulled myself higher on his body so I could drill his prostate. Christ, it was amazingly hot. His moaning was punctuated with ""harder, Daddy,"" ""you own my hole,"" ""use my ass,"" and ""sooo much better than [his husband],"" among other choice phrases. The timbre of his voice crept upward, more feminine, as he lost himself in the fuck until I clamped my ringed hand over his mouth and made him lick the lube and taste of his cum-loaded ass off the ring. (I'm getting hard in a restaurant typing this into my phone. Fuck!) His mouth practically raped my willing hand. 

It was too hot by far and he deserved a reward. With a few hard shoves I gave him ""something to take home to your fucking husband"" and flooded his ass. Fuck, I just about passed out... I pushed up, breathing hard and still straddling his ass, and slowly slid out of his hole. A glob of cum pulsed out of my cock and I was struck by inspiration again. I slid his wedding band off my finger, covered it in my cum, and slid it back on his hand before pushing the rest of the cum in to join my load.

Afterwards, as we sopped up lube and stray cum, he thanked me profusely for convincing him to come over. His husband doesn't put out much, apparently, and as I said, a man needs to fuck. I've had some grateful bottoms over the years, but none of them have gone home with my cum between them and the symbol of their marriage (and my handprints still visible on their ass cheeks... oops!). I asked about it a couple days later and he hasn't taken the ring off since. I'll definitely be getting a piece of him on the side again soon.",gaycheaters,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaycheaters/comments/pdnxy2/helping_other_married_guys_cheat/,,StacksofBooks69,pdnxy2,/r/gaycheaters/comments/pdnxy2/helping_other_married_guys_cheat/,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaycheaters/comments/pdnxy2/helping_other_married_guys_cheat/,13,2021-08-29
I‚Äôm A Real Estate Agent. Have I Got A House To Show You.,"I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm so infatuated with houses. But I am. 

I think it stems from my Stepmothers passion for building and creating miniature houses. 

She would sit for hours, with her glue gun and scissors, putting the houses together, then placing her little miniature chairs, dressers, people, and many other pieces into them, creating some of the most amazing life-like miniature houses that I had ever seen. 

Some of the smaller houses took her only days to complete, while the larger, more intricate ones took her weeks sometimes months to finish.  

She built so many houses, that my father actually had the construction company in town build a large addition onto the house, just off the dining room, so she could display them, and show them off to any visitors. 

I spent a lot of time in that room, in complete awe of her creations. 

I even built one myself, with her help of course. It was a small ‚Äútraining‚Äù house, as she put it. 

It didn‚Äôt turn out half bad, if I do say so myself. 

It was nowhere near the quality of hers, but still not bad. 

I still have it upstairs in my closet. 

Now, as I grew into my teenage years, my infatuation grew, and went from miniature houses to real houses. 

Everywhere I went with my parents, I would always look at the houses, imagining the layout of the house, the furniture arrangements, and what window represented what room. 

I was also intrigued by the way the house looked from the outside, the style of the house, and it‚Äôs color. 

My favorite style of house is Gothic Victorian. 

Anyway, when I turned 16 and got my drivers license, I got a part time, after school job at Bob‚Äôs Hardware Store in town, which was later bought out by 84 Lumber. 

But, that‚Äôs not really important!

Now, the high school I went to was about a mile away from the store, so I‚Äôd just walk there after school, and my father would pick me up after work. 

Until I saved enough money to buy a car. 

I would help unload the trucks, stock the shelves, and cashier on occasion. 

Anyway, after buying a car, I would ride around town, as well as neighboring towns, after school, on my days off, and on the weekends, when I was off, taking pictures of all the houses I liked. 

I would take every back road, side road, dirt road, or any road I could find in search of houses to photograph. 

I got lost a few times, and had to use Google Maps to get home. 

Anyway, I spent almost every dime I made on gas, insurance, and instant cameras. 

I would have the pictures developed, and put them in a photo album. 

By the time I graduated, I had over 100 photo albums, full of house pictures. 

Now, I worked at Bob‚Äôs Hardware for about two years, when it was bought out by 84 Lumber. 

I worked there for about a year and a half after that, still driving around taking pictures. 

I was about 22 at the time. 

Soon after, just taking pictures of houses was not enough for me anymore, I wanted to go INSIDE the houses. 

Now, I‚Äôm not a criminal, so breaking and entering was not an option, besides I don‚Äôt look good in orange. 

Anyway, I knew I had to come up with a plan, and I did. 

The only way I could think of, to be able to go in random people‚Äôs houses, without getting arrested, and check out every square inch of the place was...

You guessed it. 

I became a Real Estate Agent.  

You know, the people that sell houses for other people. 

Anyway, at first, I had no idea how to do that, so I Googled it. 

There, it showed me the step by step procedure for becoming one. 

I contacted Delaware‚Äôs Real Estate Regulatory Office to see if I fit the requirements, and I did. 

I then completed 99 hours of Prelicensing Courses, and passed the exam.

I got a 93%. 

It cost me about 700 bucks. 

‚ÄúMan! This is turning into one expensive hobby!‚Äù, I thought. 

Anyway, I then had to take the Delaware Real Estate Salespersons Exam, and passed that as well. 

I forgot what my score was. 

I had to have a background check done, which came back excellent.  

After that, I contacted a friend from high school, named Frank, who was an actual Real Estate Agent, and asked him to help me become one. 

He put me in touch with the agency he worked for, and they agreed to sponsor me, making Frank my mentor. 

I was so excited. 

I then created an account on the DELPROS website, paid the licensing fee, and printed out my license. 

And BAM! Just like that. I was a Real Estate Agent, working for a major, well known agency, for commission only, of course. 

3% of the total sale, which isn‚Äôt bad, because if I sell just one house a month, for as little as 100,000 dollars, I‚Äôd make 3,000 dollars. 

That‚Äôs more than I‚Äôd make in two months at Bob‚Äôs. 

I still worked at the hardware store, on the weekends just to have a little bit of money coming in, on a weekly basis, until I sold a few houses. 

I made enough money at Bob‚Äôs , to move out of my parents house, and rent a room at the flop house in town. 

The guy in the room next to mine, used to be a [truck driver](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMindOfMikey/comments/p54dn4/i_was_a_cross_country_truck_driver_believe_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), but something spooked him, so he doesn‚Äôt drive a truck anymore. 

Anyway, I had business cards printed up... 

SellRite Real Estate Agency.
David Stephenson, Agent.
1-(555)-382-5968. 

Now, I shadowed Frank for a few weeks, learning the ins and outs of how to be an agent.

Talking to the clients, doing the paperwork, showing the houses, and all that good stuff. 

Now, there are four other agents in the office besides me, and being that I am the newest agent, I got the desk all the way in the back corner. 

There‚Äôs Brenda, she‚Äôs got the front left desk, as you walk in. 

She‚Äôs in her mid 40‚Äôs, but she dresses like she‚Äôs in her 20‚Äôs. 

She‚Äôs Cougar-ous, slightly chubby, kind of stuck-up, with bleached blonde hair, and an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than you‚Äù look on her face. 

She obviously had some ‚ÄúCosmetic Surgery‚Äù done to her upper torso, not that I noticed or anything. 

She‚Äôs the top seller in the office.  

Then, there‚Äôs Deacon, on the front right. 

He‚Äôs in second place. 

He‚Äôs a middle-aged African-American man, with a striking resemblance to Danny Glover, in his Lethal Weapon days.

He‚Äôs cool! He talks about his wife and kids A LOT. 

Now, behind Brenda is Frank, in third place. 

He‚Äôs in his mid twenties, just like me, also a bachelor, but he has an extreme case of Brenda-itis. 

It SO obvious. 

I just think she‚Äôs fake. 

Anyway, next to Frank is Amy, in fourth place. 

She‚Äôs a thirty-something year old soccer mom. 

She‚Äôs quiet, and mostly just stays to herself. 

And then theres me, in last place obviously. 

I am... well... let‚Äôs say... to quote ‚ÄúWeird Al‚Äù, white and nerdy. 

Like I said before, I was all the way in the back corner behind Frank. 

Now, I‚Äôve never believed in ghosts, entities, or anything paranormal. 

That was... until a few weeks ago. 

The day started off normal, it was business as usual. 

It was about 8:30, if I remember correctly. 

It was just me, Frank, and Deacon in the office. 

Brenda had an early showing that day, and it was Mother/Daughter Day at Amy‚Äôs kids Elementary School. 

Anyway, Deacon was talking with a nice young couple looking to buy a house, and Frank was on the phone with someone, talking about something, I don‚Äôt even know. 

I was just sitting there, swirling my pen between my fingers. 

When he walked in. 

He was about mid thirties, with disheveled brown hair. His clothes were dirty, and wrinkled, and looked like he slept in them for about a week. 

He was nervous... REALLY NERVOUS. 

He was shaking, stepping side to side, wiping his hands together, and looking left and right. 

Frank turned to me, still on the phone, covered the microphone with his hand, and said, ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready!‚Äù, I whispered nervously. 

‚ÄúYes you are! Go!‚Äù, he sharply replied. 

I then got up, putting the pen on the desk, and walked toward the man, ‚ÄúHi! I‚Äôm David! How may I help you?‚Äù, I asked completely petrified. 

I mean, this was my first time going solo. 

Anyway, he quickly stepped towards me, I thought he was gonna hit me.

‚ÄúI... I... I wanna sell my house, or... or... just give it to someone. I don‚Äôt care. 

Here... Here‚Äôs the keys, and... and the deed, I... I just signed it over. My...my name, and... and phone number... are... are on the keychain. You gotta help me, man...You gotta!‚Äù he said, with extreme nervousness, as he handed me the keys, and a folded up piece of paper. 

His hands were shaking the whole time. 

He then turned and practically ran out of the door, made a left, and scurried down the street. 

‚ÄúWhat price are you looking for?‚Äù, I yelled, as the door closed. 

I just stood there completely dumbfounded, holding the keys in one hand, and the paper in the other. 

After about a minute or so, I turned around, and looked at Frank, to see him staring back at me. 

He was off the phone at that point. 

Deacon and the couple were staring as well. 

Now, the first rule for deciding whether you are going to list the house under your name, and the agencies name, is to do a walk through. 

Although the circumstances were not ideal, by any means, this WAS my first chance to make some real money. 

Anyway, ‚ÄúHey! Frank! You wanna come with me?‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù, he replied.  

‚ÄúTo go check out this house!‚Äù, I stated. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna list it?‚Äù, he asked. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know yet! I gotta check it out first! Right? Come on!‚Äù, I said excitedly. 

‚ÄúNo way, Man! I wouldn‚Äôt go near that place! Did you see that guy?‚Äù, he asked. 

‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôs having a bad day, I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôll go check it out myself then‚Äù, I stated. 

‚ÄúGood luck! See you when you get back! If you come back!‚Äù, Frank said laughing. 

‚ÄúVery funny, Frank!‚Äù, I replied. 

If he wasn‚Äôt my friend, I think I might have flipped him off. 

Anyway, I then looked at the paper, and yes! It was the deed to the property. 

Now, for privacy issues, I‚Äôm not going to mention his name, but I will tell you the address...

1372 North State College Road. 

It was about 5 miles away from the office. 

Anyway, I put the keys and the paper in my pocket, grabbed a SellRite ‚ÄúFor Sale‚Äù sign, grabbed my coffee mug off of my desk, pulled out my keys, walked out of the door, got in my car, and drove over there. 

In case you‚Äôre wondering, I drive a 1958 Plymouth Fury. It‚Äôs red, just like the car in that Stephen King movie ‚ÄúChristine‚Äù.

Except mines not possessed, I don‚Äôt think so anyway. 

Now, I arrived at the house.

It was a plain, no frills house. 

It was 2 storys high, 3 if you count the attic. 

It was painted white, with black shudders. The paint was chipping and falling off. 

A grey concrete walkway and steps led to a old, rickety front porch. 

There was a red beat-up car in the driveway. 
 
Two dead trees on either side of the front yard. 

And the top left ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù window broke out. 

It was on a quarter acre plot of land, that looked like it hadn‚Äôt been maintained for years. 

Standing on the sidewalk, directly in front of the house was a man... an old, creepy man. 

He was staring at the house, with his back to me. Well, I assumed it was a man, as I couldn‚Äôt see his face at the time. 

He wore a long black trench coat, and had long stringy gray hair. 

‚ÄúIs this what that guy was so afraid of?‚Äù, I thought. 

I parallel parked the car a few houses up, and began to walk back. 

I got to the house, and said to the man, ‚ÄúExcuse me! I‚Äôm responsible for this place. What are you doing?‚Äù

He then turned around, and my assumption was correct... it was a man. But, he was creepier than I thought. 

His skin was pale white and almost transparent, his hands were just skin and bones. 

He had sunken cheek bones, bulging dark, nearly black eyes, with severely chapped lips. 

He stood with a cane, with what appeared to be a goat‚Äôs head on it. 

He opened his mouth to speak, pieces of dried flesh falling from his lips, as he said, ‚ÄúI am preparing for battle!‚Äù, in a deep, raspy voice. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù, I replied.

He then stared straight at me with this dead black eyes, and said, ‚ÄúEvil lives within this land. Heed my words, and leave at once.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan! What kind of shit have you been smoking! Get the hell out of here! I got work to do!‚Äù, I responded, blowing him off as some nutcase, as I walked up to the door, pulling the keys out of my pocket. 

‚ÄúBelieve not a thing of what you hear, and even less of what you see, young man! For the devil is a sneaky son of a bitch!‚Äù, he yelled, as I put the key in the lock. 

I then turned my head to see the old man standing in the middle of the yard, his arms raised high to the sky, his head leaning back, pointing the cane upwards, and babbling to himself. 

I just shook my head, as I turned the key, and opened the door. 

A cold gust of wind hit me hard, directly in the face, causing me to step back a little. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù, I thought, as I took a step inside.

The interior of the house, was in worse condition than the exterior. The floorboards were severely cracked, and missing in some places.

The walls had all kinds of strange symbols, and even stranger writings on them. I would say it was graffiti but I‚Äôve never seen graffiti look like that. 

The air was thick, almost suffocating, and smelled like old dirt, rotten potatoes, and foot sweat, all mixed together. 

I almost puked all over myself. 

Adjusting to the smell, I turned to shut the door, then turned back around. 

What happened next, is unlike anything that ever happened to me before. 

I turned around to see the old decrepit house morph into the layout of my parents house, the staircase on the wall to my left, and the living room on the right. 

The floors bright and shiny, the walls were wallpapered in the awful green color that my mother loved so much, and it smelled like warm apple pie. 

My mother liked to bake. 

Anyway, ‚ÄúFuck the what?‚Äù, I said to myself. 

‚ÄúWait a minute!‚Äù, I thought, ‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be real, the structural differences between the two houses told me that.‚Äù

I just stood there. 

‚ÄúDavid!‚Äù I heard a soft woman‚Äôs voice say. I couldn‚Äôt tell where it was coming from. 

I began looking around. 

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I yelled, ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù I asked, forgetting all about the differences. 

‚ÄúDavid!‚Äù I heard the voice say again. This time coming from my left. 

I turned in that direction, but I didn‚Äôt see my mom. No! I saw Brenda, standing on the bottom step of the stairs. 

She wore a short black leather mini-skirt, and a tight leopard printed V-neck shirt. 

She grabbed the front collar of the shirt, pulling it down, exposing a good portion of her ‚ÄúCustom Made Friends‚Äù.

‚ÄúBrenda‚Äù, I said surprised, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for you‚Äù, she said seductively, stepping off the step, and doing a little bouncy strut over to me. 

‚ÄúHow did you know I would even be here?‚Äù, I asked her. 

She then lifted her right arm, extending her index finger, and placed it against my lips. 

‚ÄúSsshhh!‚Äù She whispered, as she placed her left arm on my shoulder, put her hand on the back of my neck, and began playing with my hair. 

She then removed her finger from my lips, leaned forward, and began to passionately kiss me. 

Her breath was warm and inviting. 

Now, like I stated before, I really didn‚Äôt like the woman, but in that moment in time, I really didn‚Äôt care about that. 

I closed my eyes, and began to kiss her back. 

I opened my eyes, in between kisses, and was completely horrified. 

I wasn‚Äôt kissing Brenda. No!

I was kissing this hideous green skinned creature, with blood red hair, blacker than black eyes, and the tongue of a rattlesnake. 

I found out the hard way about that one. 

It was completely naked, with no female upper body parts or reproductive organs. 

Anyway, in complete disgust, I pushed the creature away. 

It‚Äôs back hitting hard against the railing of the stairs.

It then reached back behind itself, grabbing the spokes of the stairs, with its abnormally sized fingers. 

It‚Äôs fingers had long, pointy, pick-like nails.

It then leaned forward, and began laughing hysterically, jumping up and down as it did.  

It screamed, a high pitch scream, and then disappeared into a cloud of grey smoke. 

‚ÄúFuck this!‚Äù I said, turning around, grabbing the doorknob, and trying to turn it. 

It wouldn‚Äôt turn. 

It wouldn‚Äôt move. 

The door... would not open. 

Panic than set in, as I began pounding on the door. 

‚ÄúHelp! Help! Somebody! Old Guy! Help‚Äù, I screamed at the top of my lungs, over and over and over again. 

Exhausted from screaming, I stopped pounding on the door, and hung my head. 

I caught my breath, closed my eyes, turned back around, went to lean back against the door, and fell on my ass. 

The door was gone, and I was now sitting on the floor in an old underground tunnel, at least that‚Äôs what it looked like to me. 

I opened my eyes when I hit the floor. 

Anyway, I stood up, looking left to see nothing but a old, dingy battleship gray hallway. I looked right to see the same. 

‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be happening!‚Äù I thought. 

But it was. 

I reached in my pocket, pulled out a quarter, and held it in my hand. 

‚ÄúOk! Heads, I go right. Tails, I go left.‚Äù I said to the open air, then tossed the coin in the air, caught it with my right hand, and smacked it on the back of my left wrist. 

I hesitated before looking.

Finally I removed my hand. 

It was Heads, ‚ÄúRight I go!‚Äù I said to the air once again, and took off running as fast as I could. 

I was running and running and running, full speed, for what seemed like forever. 

Until I slammed hard into, well nothing, more like an invisible barrier. 

I hit it hard... seriously hard. 

‚ÄúSon of a bitch!‚Äù, I screamed, holding my head, and my left shoulder, as I fell to the ground reeling in pain, fearing I had a concussion, or a broken shoulder, or maybe both. 

After a while, the pain subsided to a tolerable amount. 

I then mustered up every single ounce of energy I had left, planted my feet, and pushed myself up, with my right arm, into a standing position. 

Wicked laughter echoed through the hallway. 

‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you want from me?‚Äù I screamed. 

Suddenly, on the wall in front of me, a door began to appear. 

I blinked my eyes, and looked at the door.

Two ceramic numbers hung from the center of the door. 

A one, and a seven. 17. 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my room number at the flop house.‚Äù I thought. 

I blinked my eyes again, and now I was standing in the hallway of the flop house. 

The same dirty red and gold carpet on the floor. The same faded wood paneling on the walls, and the same smell of cat urine in the air. 

‚ÄúI should have listened to that old man. I should have never came in this house. This shit is... fucked up‚Äù, I thought, ‚ÄúThis is not a house. This is Hell!‚Äù

I then extended my hand, and went to grab the door knob. 

The door then began to slowly open, all by itself. 

I stood there in complete shock. 

As the door opened, it revealed my room to be exactly the way I left it. 

My favorite coffee cup sitting on the nightstand, my Falling In Reverse band shirt on the floor, and the window blind pulled halfway up, missing the same slat. 

I walked in, leaving the door open, sat down on my bed, leaned back against the pillows, and looked up at the light fixture on the ceiling. 

I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath. 

Suddenly, the door slammed shut, startling me. 

I opened my eyes, still looking at the ceiling, and saw swarms of cockroaches began scurrying out of the light, and falling down on me. 

I shot up like a bullet, only to discover that cockroaches were everywhere. 

The walls, the floors, the ceiling, on the tv, the coffee pot, the microwave. EVERYWHERE! Running all around. 

I screamed. You see, I don‚Äôt DO bugs

I stood up, and heard the crunch, as my feet smashed their little cockroache bodies. 

They soon began crawling up my legs, and falling in my hair, on my face, and in my shirt. 

I was ‚Äúdancing‚Äù around, swatting myself like a crazy man. 

‚ÄúFuck this! Fuck the house!‚Äù, I yelled, and then primal screamed, as I grabbed my head, and made a running dive out of the open window, hoping to finally be out of this God forsaken house, and I was. 

I hit the porch roof, rolling off, and slamming hard on the ground below. 

No roaches! No hallway! No laughter, and no Brenda. 

I was out. 

I laid on the grass for quite some time, until I realized I was still on the property, and the window I just fell out of was the already broken upstairs window. 

‚ÄúHow did I get upstairs?‚Äù, I thought. 

I quickly scurried to my hands and knees, and crawled to the sidewalk. 

I painfully stood up, and stumbled to my car, pulling out my keys, opening the door, getting in, and putting the key in the ignition. 

I then looked at myself in the rearview mirror. 

My hair was a mess. My shirt and tie were stained and wrinkled. 

I looked just like the guy that came into the office. 

Anyway, as I was just about to start the car, I closed my eyes, and heard a loud pounding sound on the hood. 

I opened my eyes to see the old guy standing there, in front of my car. 

He scared the shit out of me. 

He then moved around to the drivers side door. 

‚ÄúWhat incidents occurred within the home?‚Äù he asked. 

I turned my head and just looked at him. 

‚ÄúTell me!‚Äù, he said more aggressively. 

I told him. 

‚ÄúDo you wish to remove the unnatural entities that possess this land?‚Äù He asked, ‚ÄúTell me and I will do just that!‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I do, I got a job to do here!‚Äù, I replied, then added, ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome! We‚Äôll talk‚Äù, he replied, stepping back into the street. 

A car horn then sounded, as a white minivan rolled past my car, and appeared to roll right THROUGH the old man. 

After what just happened, it didn‚Äôt even phase me. 

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù, I asked concerned. 

‚ÄúIndeed, young man.‚Äù, he replied, ‚ÄúCome! Let‚Äôs talk!‚Äù

I opened the car door, looking back before I did. 

I grabbed my coffee cup, then got out of the car. 

Now, across the street, and to the left, was a small canopy sitting area, with benches, and flowers underneath it. 

So, we walked over there, well... I walked. The old man seemed to be gliding. 

‚ÄúWho the fuck is this guy?‚Äù, I thought. 

We soon arrived at the canopy, and sat down on a bench.  

I took a drink of my coffee. It was cold, but cold coffee is better than no coffee. Right?

Anyway, the old man then began speaking, ‚ÄúI have existed for many ages, and have bared witness to indescribable acts of evil. 

Such acts that would cripple your very soul, young man. 

For I am not what I may seem. 

My appearance, for which you see before you now, is what I choose to project to you. 

I am here not to frighten you, but to help you. 

I possess the power to banish said evils, sending them back to whatever crevices, in the depths of Hell, for which they came. 

All you have to do is ask.‚Äù, he said. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the catch?‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúNo catch!‚Äù, he replied, ‚ÄúThis is what I was created to do!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúThat is not your concern, just know that I am true to my words!‚Äù, he said.

‚ÄúHow do I know you‚Äôre not lying, and that you‚Äôre not some hellish creature that‚Äôs gonna kill me?‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt! But if I wanted to bring forth your death, I would have ceased your existence when we first conversed. Do you want my assistance or not?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! Yes I do‚Äù, I quickly answered. 

‚ÄúGood! Now ask me!‚Äù, he instructed. 

‚ÄúUm! Will you help me... get rid of... Uh! Whatever evil is... is in that house?‚Äù, I asked nervously. 

‚ÄúIt would be my pleasure!‚Äù, he responded, ‚ÄúShall we go?‚Äù

We both stood up, and made our way back to the house, leaving my mug on the bench. 

We stood on the front porch, facing the door. 

‚ÄúWhat do you need me to do?‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúNot a thing‚Äù, he replied, turning to face me, ‚ÄúStand your ground, and do not allow this door to open under any circumstances, and whatever you do, DO NOT ENTER this house, no matter what your ears may hear, or your eyes may see. Until I am standing before you once again. Is that clear?‚Äù

‚ÄúAbsolutely!‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna go in there.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood! Now be quiet!‚Äù, he commanded. 

He then faced the door, raised his arms outward, and began speaking Latin, I believe. 

Suddenly, the door began to open, all by itself. 

The old man then rose about 2 inches off the ground, and floated into the house. 

The door slamming hard in my face. 

All was silent, until the screaming started. I‚Äôll call it screaming but it was more like a shriek. 

It grew louder and louder as every second passed, and then... it just stopped. 

Several loud thuds could be heard soon after, followed by the sound of babies crying. 

The front door started to shake, as if someone... or SOMETHING was trying to open it. 

I grabbed the knob and pull back as hard as I could, as the babies cried on. 

‚ÄúDavid‚Äù, I then heard Brenda say, well... it was her voice, but I knew it wasn‚Äôt her. 

‚ÄúNo! You‚Äôre not real. Leave me alone!‚Äù, I screamed, still pulling on the door.  

‚ÄúOpen the door, David!‚Äù, it said. 

At that moment, the entire house began to shake with the force of a thousand angry men, dark grey storm clouds filled the skies, as the sound of thunder roared in the distance. 

The wood beams holding up the porch were started to crack and splinter. The picture window beside the door burst outward sending glass flying everywhere. 

The rain then came pouring down. 

A huge lightning bolt struck the dead tree on the left of the house, causing one half to fall on the car in the driveway, and the other half to fall on the roof of the porch. 

I screamed, completely terrified. 

I mean, I never believed in this stuff before, and now I‚Äôm helping to fight it. 

‚ÄúThis is the craziest, and coolest day, I‚Äôve had in my whole entire life‚Äù, I thought. 

I then heard what sounded like a sonic boom.

Everything became still and quiet at that point. 

The sky was clear, the ground was dry, the house stopped shaking, the tree was still standing, and the windows, including the upstairs window were fully intact.

And best of all, no more crying babies.

I was still pulling on the door, in fear that this all might be a trick, when I heard a deep, raspy voice from behind me say, ‚ÄúMy work here is done!‚Äù

This land is now cleansed, and sealed. No more shall the evils that once dwelled upon it cross its boundaries.‚Äù, the old man said. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over!‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúMost certainly. Now, It was a pleasure meeting you, David.‚Äù

He then told me his name, but due to our agreement, I can not  tell you what it is. 

‚ÄúIf you are ever in need of my assistance, simply speak my name aloud, and I will come. But you shall never reveal my name to anyone. Do you understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, (name retracted by request), I understand.‚Äù I replied. 

‚ÄúGood! I bid you ado!‚Äù, he said. 

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù, I yelled, ‚ÄúWhen I first saw you, you were standing on the sidewalk in front of the house. Who called you then?‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúNo one, my dear boy! I was roaming around down here, in search of something to do. I past this house, and got the overwhelming sense that all was not right with the universe, and that my services would soon be needed, and they were.‚Äù he replied, ‚ÄúGoodbye, David.‚Äù

He the began walking, well... gliding down the sidewalk, and then disappeared into thin air. 

I just stood there watching him go. 

I turned around, looked at the house, and smiled, ‚ÄúI got a great idea!‚Äù, I said to myself. 

I walked over to the bench, got my coffee mug, went back to my car, got in, and drove back to the office. 

I pulled in the parking lot, parked the car, got out, and walked inside. 

Everyone was there. 

All their heads rose up and stared directly at me, a look of shock on their faces. 

I then began walking to my desk. 

I passed Brenda, on my left, I couldn‚Äôt even look at her. 

I said ‚ÄúHi‚Äù to Deacon, smiled at Amy, and waved to Frank. 

All their heads turned towards me as I passed. 

I then sat down at my desk.

Frank then turned around, with a look of concern on his face. 

‚ÄúAre you alright, man?‚Äù, he asked. 

‚ÄúI will be.‚Äù, I stated.

‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù, he asked confused. 

‚ÄúI went to look at the house, remember?‚Äù, I replied. 

Amy just stared at me, and Brenda pretended that I wasn‚Äôt even there. 

‚ÄúUm! You left on Tuesday! It‚Äôs now Friday! Three weeks later, David!‚Äù, Deacon stated. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù, I replied in shock. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been gone for three weeks, Man! What the hell happened.‚Äù, Frank asked. 

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt believe me if I told you!‚Äù, I responded, ‚ÄúCan we just drop it? Please! I‚Äôm back now. So, can we just leave it at that?‚Äù, I asked. 

‚ÄúSure! Ok! You betcha!‚Äù, they responded. 

Frank then looked at me funny. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù, I asked him. 

‚ÄúYou look like shit, man!‚Äù, he said, ‚ÄúGo home, and get cleaned up. We‚Äôll see you on Monday!‚Äù

I agreed, and gathered my things, including the deed to the property. 

I drove back to the flop house, and asked the house manager if it be possible to change rooms. 

She seemed a little puzzled, but agreed. 

I‚Äôm moved to room 23. 

I went to my old room, grabbed my clothes, my phone charger, and all my DVD‚Äôs, leaving the rest of it behind. 

I washed the ALL my clothes immediately, that whole cockroach thing still freaks me
out. 

Anyway, I laid down in my new bed, in my new room, and slept for 13 hours straight. 

I woke up the next morning, and went to the County Recorders Office. Yes! It‚Äôs open on Saturday. 

I had to deed switched over into my name, for a small fee of course, and then went back home. 

I rested for the rest of the day, and the next day, then went back to work on Monday. 

That was about four months ago. 

Now, after what I had just been through, and survived, I had a big boost in confidence. 

In that time, I‚Äôve sold a few houses, 11 to be exact, I‚Äôm still in last place, but I‚Äôve made some descent money. 

I quit my job at Bob‚Äôs, and am doing this Real Estate thing full time now. 

I have seen some beautiful and amazing houses, and I‚Äôve started taking interior pictures as well. 

Anyway, I contacted the guy who owned the house originally, got his new address, and asked him how much he wanted for the place. 

He said he was just glad to get rid of the place. 

I send him a check for 10% of what I make off of each sale, I sent him his last check this morning. 

I contacted the construction company in town, and made arrangements for them totally remodel the place, back to its original state. 

It took them four months to do so. 

It cost me a pretty penny, but this place is beautiful now. 

I worked out a payment plan with them, I start paying next month. 

I had the two dead trees removed, hired a landscaping team to fix the yard, and donated the car to Goodwill. 

I had the electric turned on, and had cable installed. So, now I can watch live TV. 

I finally told Brenda what happened between ‚Äúus‚Äù. She just smiled, and said, ‚ÄúYou wish!‚Äù

I can‚Äôt stand that woman. 

Anyway, I packed my stuff, and moved out of the flop house this morning, and this will be my first night in my new house, Thanks to... well, you know who I‚Äôm talking about. 

No more green, red haired creatures! No more roaches, and no extended reality. 

I wish he could see this place now, yet somehow I think he can. 

I borrowed a sleeping bag from Frank, Deacon gave me an old table lamp to use, and Amy let me borrow one of their old coffee pots. 

I bought coffee, creamer, and sugar at the grocery store in town. I forget the name, something with a ‚ÄúB‚Äù, I think. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm gonna sleep in the living room tonight, and start furniture shopping in the morning. 

Well, it‚Äôs getting pretty late, I gotta be up early tomorrow. So, Goodnight Everyone!

My Last Partner Left Us Scarred.,"I have a lot on my chest that I need to get off. It has been ten months since our ""throuple"" (if that's what we call it) has ended, and quite honestly I am scarred. I do have the fleeting heart that wants to open our relationship back up and give our love that we have, but it also now gives me extreme panic attacks and I hate it, not to mention I have a lot of guilt about myself harbored inside of me.   
A and I met when we were in high school. I instantly fell in love with them. I thought they were beautiful and funny. They had a lot of stories, all relating to the abuse they had faced growing up. I listened and gave them a shoulder to cry on. I was there through their hard awful abusive relationships even when they would push me away for months to even a year. That would have been the first red flag, that is if I actually paid attention to them and didn't look at A with rose colored lenses. This lasted for seven years. I remained their loyal friend. I gave them anything I could. Money, weed, a ride somewhere, or even a place to sleep. I did it willingly. Because I loved them. 

We were going to move in, A and I. I was excited about our new life together. They were my best friend. We were suppose to have a wonderful time as roommates and then we both had plans to move to another state once the time came that I finished my apprenticeship. That didn't last long, though, because they met Z. 

He was different from all of A's other exes. He cared about their friends. Wanted to get to know me. Encouraged A to keep me around because he also wanted to be my friend, and that's what we became. I didn't want to let A move in with him over me, but i quickly realized how selfish that was, so I agreed. A should move in with Z. 

You see, they moved so quickly in that direction because A was still staying with their ex. Of course it was an ex that they said abused them, so I was quick to trying to find them somewhere to go. We were going to move into this mother in law apartment on my parent's property. I have a medical condition that makes it difficult for me to be on my own in case anything could happen. So, we agreed to tear up and remodel the unit if it meant we could have it all to ourselves, but also have the security of knowing that if A couldn't help me my family could. 

It would take us awhile to get all the remodeling done and A made it apparent that they needed an out right then and there. So, Z and I went for a car ride. I explained my fears of A abandoning me again when they moved in together, but Z assured me that wouldn't happen. I believed him. After all, he was already different from all of A's previous partners. So, I said yes. I told A not to feel bad and that they should definitely move in with Z if they wanted to. 

Z had a good job. He makes great money and because of that he told A that they didn't have to work. He didn't mind being the provider if they were comfortable cooking dinner and making sure all the animals were taken care of. 

Z and I became great friends and he ended up working together. He would confide in me about things happening with A and how he should handle them or try to figure out what A was meaning when they said certain things. A would do the same thing with me, but they would talk about Z. It kind of made it easy. They had trouble understanding each other and I tried to help. 

At least, I tried to help until A began getting jealous. A would send me frantic text messages with screenshots of messages that quite honestly didn't reveal any flirting that they claimed were there. Z has to use instagram to run his business. It is how he gets clients. He frequently became friends with repeat clients. It happens as business owners. It's not unusual. I never read a message that Z sent that sounded like he had any other intentions. So, I told A this. I though that they needed to talk it out with Z and that it would hopefully be resolved that way. 

A began coming to me with other claims. Ones that weren't lining up with what A was telling Z's friend B. I told A that they and Z were probably just toxic for each other and that they should get out of this now. That never happened, though. 

Because I was worried about A, I began spending more time over there. I'd spend the night. At first it would be on their couch, and then eventually both of them asked if I'd like to platonically cuddle with them in their bed. Of course I wanted to, I loved A, but I was also starting to fall for Z.  

I didn't want to tell them. I didn't want to get into their messy relationship, but my heart would not let me let it go. So, Z and I were going for a car ride and I saw my opportunity. I told him, ""I like you and A more than friends. I know this may complicate things and that either of you could not feel the same. So, just say the word and we can never speak of this and act like this conversation never happened."" Z didn't confirm his feelings, he only said we should talk to A. 

I was an anxious mess as we drove back to the house. I didn't know what A would say. They have known that I have had a crush on them here and there, but I had started saying that we should never date. I did that more to protect my own feelings because it always felt like A never returned the same thoughts about me. 

It felt as if I raced inside. I grabbed A and told them that Z and I wanted to talk downstairs in the room. Away from any other ears. When we got in the room my heart started pounding and then I just blurted it out, same as before. I like you... if you don't like me.... blah blah blah. But A said they liked me, and that if Z liked me then they wanted to pursue something.

I couldn't believe it, it felt far too good to be true. Which is probably why everything started going down hill after the first three days. We set up rules and boundaries, but everyday A made the rules stricter. A would begin throwing fits and have melt downs any time Z and I showed any attention to each other. 

I loved them both, though, and I figured that A just had some jealousy that we could all work through. Turns out, A began documenting anything wrong they ever saw in our relationship. They would message friends telling them how they could never love two people, how they didn't want to share Z. A even messaged Z and told him that they don't want to share him with anyone else, but they took it back almost immediately. 

If they never took it back it would have ended differently. We would have split in an agreement that I just wasn't meant to be apart of them. A had other plans, though. They began putting Z and I against each other. Telling us each little lies here and there until it became a web that Z and I were both tripping over. 

You see, we began connecting the dots. A was lying left and right. When I caught them writing in their notes app, I got sick to my stomach. They were taking pictures of Z and I sleeping and wrote little notes as if Z and I were maliciously turned towards each other as we slept. We confronted A about these notes, but they claimed it was for their memory. I didn't buy a word of that bullshit. If it was for memory they would have been documenting all the good in the day too, but no, it was only when we were sleeping. 

Z and I decided to let it go, though, thinking that couples therapy could help us. We went to one session. A lied left and right about things in that appointment, and the therapist sucked that shit right up. It was when I began falling out of love with them. I was seeing behind the person suit, and I was sick to my stomach. 

I began consulting in B and my mom. I told them the struggle of still loving Z, but having a hard time staying because A was becoming a toxic leach on my side. They suggested I take a break and move back home till I knew what I wanted. I tend to overthink things, so we all figured that if I did so it might help me figure everything out without making too emotional of a choice. 

I never got to get to that stage, though. A started an argument one morning, a morning where we were in a hurry because I had an MRI only a few hours later. It was during this argument that Z brought up the lies. A tried to cover them up with more lies until I was able to get my voice and point out a big flaw in A's argument. I was sick that morning. I went straight into the bathroom and didn't say a word to either of them. A insisted that Z was a bad boyfriend because he didn't go and great them and love them like I did that morning. 

A didn't like me addressing the flaw in their story and became irate. Z asked why they kept lying about things and assured them that we could be told the truth. We gave A an option to confess, but instead they said that they were leaving and walked out the door. 

Z and I were stunned. Did we just get broken up with? Who knew. A did, of course, they came right back in and said they didn't know why they said that. Their tire is flat and they can't go anywhere and they don't want to break up. 

I personally don't like being walked out on and so I was deep in my own head. I was making the decision to go home. 

We didn't get to discuss this more because I had to go to my MRI. Z said he wanted to go with me and then asked A if they would like to join. They declined insisting that they wanted to stay home and clean up the house. I was upset, admittedly, so I didn't say goodbye to A or kiss them or tell them I loved them. This was something that Z pointed out in the car and I admitted that it was a cruel thing to do, so I explained myself in a text to A, but A never replied to me. 

We went to my MRI and we agreed that after we finish work that night that we are going to all go home and talk this through. That never happened, though. A called their mom and packed up all of their stuff. They stormed into our work and huffed at Z to go outside with them. This is where they broke up with Z claiming how much I mistreated them, and how I was so close to getting physically abusive with them. It was honestly the last lie that should've never been said. If A wanted to leave they should've just said they didn't want to do this relationship anymore. 

I was personally upset with this claim because of the abuse I suffered growing up. I wouldn't dare lay my hand on anyone else. I often times put myself clear across the room when there are disagreements because conflict is a trigger for my ptsd relating to my abuse. 

To top off the cake, I never got broken up with. I never got a goodbye. I never got an explanation. Seven years of friendship was thrown down the drain all because I loved her and I couldn't let that go. 

Z and I didn't know what to do. We had agreed that if all three of us didn't work out that we would all break up, but with all of the realizations we were  having after the fact we decided that we did truly love each other and even though A left, we didn't think we would have to. I don't regret staying with Z, but I still feel like I betrayed my best friend, that I stole their boyfriend right out from under them.

I honestly never meant for any of this to happen. I miss A sometimes... Sometimes I want to reach out, but I also have reached a point where I have analyzed all of A's stories and each one of them unravels themselves. I never knew A. Their whole life was a lie to me. The stories they told weren't true. A bit of my own online investigative searching made it pretty clear that it was all just a veil pulled over my eyes.   


TL;DR   
I joined a relationship with my best friend of seven years, A, and their boyfriend, Z. Z and I caught A in their jealousy, documenting of us sleeping, and their lies. Eventually they created an argument based on lies and got caught. They packed all of their things and left, giving more lies to Z, and never actually breaking up with me. I harbor a lot of guilt for Z and I staying together because I joined their relationship. 

Are Z and I the bad guys? Did I steal their partner? Am I wrong to second guess everything they ever told me?",polyamory,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/pdna4c/my_last_partner_left_us_scarred/,Advice,EdPharamint,pdna4c,/r/polyamory/comments/pdna4c/my_last_partner_left_us_scarred/,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/pdna4c/my_last_partner_left_us_scarred/,12,2021-08-29
I dunno what to do. Its like life is always on my shoulders.,"Ive recently fallen deep into depression. I never am happy, never having any energy, and never wanting to socialize. I feel like nothing is going my way.

I am trying to express me being trans, and my parents keep saying that they arent sure about that happebing. ITS NOT THEIR FUCKING CHOICE. But if they find anything (btw i have no places to hide things) they will talk to me about how they think its a bad idea. I DONT CARE ABOUT WHAT YOU THINK!

I have wanted to be able to express this at home but now i cant. So not being me, puts so much weight on my mental health and phsyical health. Ive been stress eating, so much junk food, which as a fit 15 year old, messes with everything.

I just want to leave my house. I dont feel safe to express myself, and never feel comfortable. The only time when i am slightly happy, is when im alone in the wilderness, which i can barely motivate myself for.

I have a few friends, and two good ones, who know about it. My counsellor is not doing anything anymore. I have never wanted to hurt myself. But i want to be in a fucking coma until im 18 and can leave the home

"It‚Äôs hard telling people that you have friends, when you‚Äôre really lonely","I‚Äôm (21M) in uni and I have a job at the rec center on campus. I transferred at the worst time, during COVID summer last year. With every class online, the only new relationships I made were with my coworkers. They‚Äôre the only people that even resemble ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. I usually try not to get too attached to the people that I work with. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt shit where you eat‚Äù and whatnot. Although, it‚Äôs hard knowing that those are the only people you really talk to. I‚Äôm cool with most of them, some are people I can actually see myself being good friends with. It‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt think they see me that way. Which is fine I suppose, I get it. Maybe it‚Äôs because a lot of them are already friends and I‚Äôm just the buff, quiet and stoic token black guy who you crack jokes with. I just can‚Äôt connect with them outside of that level most of the time. (No racial lol) Maybe I‚Äôm just over-sentimental. 

I have a few friends back home, but we hang out almost never. I barely talk to them. Some have kids, full time jobs and/or different schools. We‚Äôre all busy and ambitious. I feel awkward because we never really chilled outside of school in the first place. Now after all this time I want to hang out? I definitely care for them a lot though. I‚Äôm involved around campus, with whatever i can. Thanks to COVID spiking again in my state.

Diary of a Mutant Hunter - Entry 11: The Interloper,"*0110 Hours, June 6th, 2011*

*Today would‚Äôve been the Old Man‚Äôs birthday, so‚Ä¶happy birthday, Pops, see you at the Pearly Gates‚Ä¶if the big guy upstairs will even let me in anymore. Killing a warlord‚Äôs lackies is one thing, but what I did yesterday, I agree with Panzer, I crossed a line I shouldn‚Äôt have, even if I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve followed through on my threat. Leska refuses to sleep whenever I‚Äôm up, and I don‚Äôt blame her. It‚Äôs not me she should be worried about though, it‚Äôs the others once we hand her over, particularly if Dushman chooses to handle the interrogation personally. I‚Äôve seen what he does to those who annoy him sufficiently, it‚Äôs not pretty.*

*That‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm having a hard time sleeping when it‚Äôs not my guard shift though. I can hear the mutants outside, they‚Äôre hunting, and I think they know we‚Äôre around but not exactly where we are. We've taken shelter in one of Agroprom‚Äôs surface complexes, specifically the second floor ‚Äì third floor in America ‚Äì of the northern complex. Hopefully this should give us enough of a head-start on any mutants that might foolishly decide some mercs and their prisoner would make for a tasty meal.*

\~\~\~\~

Terminator kept a close eye on their prisoner even as he continued to listen for sounds of approaching mutants, now that he was the only one awake besides her. The last thing he wanted was for her to try and grab one of the others‚Äô guns and‚Ä¶well, frankly just get herself killed, but probably not before at least wounding him.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not good for you to stay up for so long, you‚Äôll pop blood vessels in your eyes‚Äù he warned Leska. The prisoner remained indignant, clearly not trusting him and refusing to sleep voluntarily.  If push came to shove and she was too exhausted to walk, they‚Äôd have to quite literally drag her back to Dead City, far from an ideal outcome, to put it lightly. After a few moments he shrugged and glanced back down the hallway as he added, ‚ÄúFine, be that way.‚Äù

A few more minutes passed, with Terminator becoming bored enough to start quietly humming some songs for nothing better to do. When he got to one in particular, to his surprise, Leska was humming along too, in tune with him, despite her feelings towards him. After a moment, he stopped, and noted, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not usually my favored genre of music, but I first heard that one when I arrived in Ukraine a little while ago‚Ä¶it‚Äôs grown on me for some reason.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the only one‚Äù Leska answered, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a group of people out there that seem to haven taken its lyrics a bit closer to heart than most.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù the merc asked.

‚ÄúThe subject of the song is a crystal that fell from space, which will bring about doomsday, there‚Äôs a group of Stalkers out there that believe there really is such a thing‚Äù Leska clarified. At this Terminator‚Äôs curiosity was piqued.

‚ÄúEllaborate‚Äù the merc replied. Leska looked up at him, yawned, and decided it was in her best interest to comply ‚Äì he had a gun, she didn‚Äôt, after all.

‚ÄúThere is a‚Ä¶rumor of sorts, that deep in the Zone, within the Sarcophagus at the power plant, there lies a massive, black crystal giving off a brilliant inner light‚Ä¶and it speaks to all who approach it, promising them their deepest desire if they succeed, but should your wish be granted, a blowout occurs, and the Zone expands‚Äù Leska recalled, ‚ÄúThe man who told me this story mentioned that there‚Äôs some strange men in the Zone who call this crystal the Monolith, and claim it to either be a gift from God or to **be** God in corporeal form.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶New Age cult bullshit, if my mom‚Äôs to be believed, those got big in the former Warsaw Pact after everything went to shit‚Äù Terminator mused. His mother was born in the Soviet Union and stayed in contact with family back home. One of her siblings got involved in such a cult once, the result wasn‚Äôt pretty.

‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs different, they seem more‚Ä¶militant than most cults, and those uniforms they wear, so strange, like the ones worn by those soldiers I saw in the Army Warehouses‚Äù Leska replied.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Terminator asked, his tone suddenly making Leska wish she hadn‚Äôt mentioned that last detail. These cultists looked like the UN personnel he‚Äôd seen before? That was concerning. What if their mission was compromised by these creeps? That could put everything the Syndicate‚Äôs done into jeopardy. ‚ÄúWhere were these cultists?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn some village in the warehouses, before they suddenly packed up and headed north towards the Red Forest‚Äù Leska answered, ‚ÄúThey all spoke so many weird languages, and even had some vehicles, even a couple of BTRs!‚Äù

‚ÄúLeska‚Ä¶if what you‚Äôre saying is true, then the situation regarding you has just become much more delicate‚Äù Terminator answered, making her heart sink even lower, but before any further conversation could take place, the merc‚Äôs attention was drawn to the end of the skywalk connecting the building the mercs had holed up in and the adjacent building. Somebody was standing there at the other end, listening in. Terminator turned on his rifle‚Äôs flashlight and shown it in the direction of the interloper, who promptly raised their own weapon and attempted to fire, but the merc was faster on the trigger and dropped him. Cautiously, the merc approached the eavesdropper, and to his horror, it was a UNISG trooper, and he was still alive, barely, after taking a burst to the stomach‚Ä¶but‚Ä¶what was with his combat webbing? Why did he have a strange vest with wires going into‚Ä¶?

‚ÄúMonolith‚Ä¶‚Äù the trooper muttered weakly, as Terminator turned around to see that Leska had followed him to the other end of the skywalk, her curiosity having gotten the better of her. With only a split second to spare, he lunged forward, pinning her to the ground beneath his full weight as the dying man behind them exploded, throwing chunks of fabric and viscera all over their surroundings. The concussion from the blast disoriented the American so much that he couldn‚Äôt even move, nor hear as the other three mercs finally roused themselves and scrambled over to him.

‚ÄúWhat blew up!?‚Äù Boomer asked.

‚ÄúThat guy did‚Ä¶‚Äù Terminator groaned as Panzer helped him to his feet while Lynx checked on Leska, who was equally dazed but still coherent‚Ä¶barely.

‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶he was one of the Monolith cultists‚Äù Leska muttered.

‚ÄúThe what?‚Äù Lynx asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain as soon as my ears stop ringing‚Ä¶‚Äù Terminator answered, as the group staggered back to their little camp. Both Terminator and Leska fell asleep right away, with the other three rotating their watches until the pair of them recovered several hours later. After having some water, Terminator explained what Leska told him, about this Monolith cult and how they seemed to have infiltrated and compromised the UNISG task force somehow‚Ä¶and the appearance of a suicide bomber wearing one of their kit seemed to confirm this. Leska, when she was able to speak, confirmed that the cultists wore the exact same uniform as the international spooks.

‚ÄúI think our mission here just became much more complicated‚Äù Panzer remarked.

‚ÄúIndeed, now we don‚Äôt have the spooks backing us up, we‚Äôve gotta do all the digging round for the labs on our own‚Äù Lynx noted, ‚ÄúWhich makes getting Leska back to HQ that much more important now.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre not just going to ask me questions and let me go?‚Äù the prisoner asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that‚Äôs no longer an option‚Äù Terminator replied flatly, ‚ÄúThis is much bigger than you probably thought, Leska, you‚Äôve just gotten yourself entangled in global geopolitics in the worst kind of way, and the powers that be tend not to keep the help around when they‚Äôre no longer useful.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt that mean they‚Äôll kill you too when you complete your mission?‚Äù Leska asked pointedly.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll keep us around until the next job‚Äù Panzer replied matter-of-factly, but now that Leska brought it up, Terminator wasn‚Äôt so sure that would be true. If they were deemed to know too much, what would be more likely, that they‚Äôd be paid to keep quiet for the rest of their lives, or just be killed to ensure their silence?

‚ÄúEnough of this, I want to make as much use of the daylight we have if you don‚Äôt mind, we need to hit the bunker in Yantar, then we‚Äôll make our way back to HQ‚Äù Terminator suggested. The others agreed, quickly packed up their camp, and were on their way once again.

"I want to move out, but how do I start adulting without feeling like life is a boring hell as part of it?","I admit that for the longest time, as someone who is 23 years old, I've avoided thinking about properly adulting. I admit a large part of it is laziness and me just wanting to have fun and feeling like adulthood is a life full of boring, difficult and pervasive paperwork and gender conforming office work and stuff like that, but also because I don't trust my parents enough to even discuss some of my long-term plans, like transitioning and the specifics of moving out (like when and where). I feel like I'm more childish than others my age but I feel like even thinking this way is problematic. I even don't know what a lot of words relating to housing and banking are, like ""mortgage"", ""deposit"" and, until recently, ""direct debit"" (still a little unclear about it), and will at some point have to learn them and would like a glossary reference or something; I feel embarrased that I'd even have to do this. I still feel daunted about cooking, but mostly because I live with parents and would just prefer not to do anything that benefits their gender policing, homophobic and multi-level marketing sympathetic asses, and partly because I'm worried about ruining it or something - I don't know, something generally puts me off of cooking (I especially find the idea of preparing meat whose animal anatomy I can still see particularly troublesome) and it's kind of not helped by the fact I still live with and depend on parents for some elements of basic living (I'm too lazy and/or intimidated to do certain things myself) and like keeping a hold of certain documentation (partly since they insist they keep the documentation for me). I'd probably be out of luck with other things too I guess like some of the paperwork and things I'd have to do to maintain the house or fix stuff.

I've been having a conversation with a former coworker (whom I will call Katniss) about moving out and found several things about her that made me even more envious of her and disappointed with myself - some of these things included how she started worked since 13 (although if I did that, I'd hate my life especially when my parents pushed me to study hard even in my spare time at a young age), moved out at 18 and is planning to get a mortgage and is more able to afford it than I am until I reach 50 (I don't want to climb the property ladder, for reasons I will specify further along this post); she generally adults better than I do despite being four years younger than me (she's 19 as I write this). My brother also does too but he's at most two years younger than me and I don't envy him except for the fact he's more easily able to hang around with women as friends (AFAIK he's not gay but like me and my sister is fine being single) because of his art-related field of work and study. Katniss is planning to try and get paid for a degree that the hospital she's working at is offering to somewhat make up for the fact that she didn't attend university - I'm stuck with over ¬£50k in debt that I may never be able to pay back (which is planned to be written off in my 50s, for now) because I conceded to my parents and sixth form school to attending university and had (and still have) very limited professional experience. However, Katniss is also seeking therapy, as part of trying to tell me how her life isn't great too, and unlike me, smokes (she says vaping is worse, I should be a little more glad I took up neither, although my relationship with alcohol is something to be noted with at least a degree of concern not too dissimilar to smoking or vaping - more on this in a different thread perhaps). I've also learned about how my plans for moving out could be helped with more dedication. I already envy Katniss for many reasons, which I can get to if you want.

Katniss told me to save up for like 3 months' worth of a rent deposit - I didn't understand anything beyond the fact that I'd need to save up and felt disappointed with myself for not understanding what ""mortgage"" and ""deposit"" meant in the context of housing. I feel too intimidated to even look them up myself because this reminds me of part of the adulting I wish to avoid (and tangentially, part of me kind of wishes I didn't speak English fluently because of colonialism). Katniss also told me that it's cheaper in the long term for me to get a mortgage.

This discussion with Katniss is what's prompted me to ask this question - I've tried to make moves to move out but put it off because of work, wanting to just try and have fun in my spare time and (because it's August) people being slower to respond than usual.

My mother even recommended I climb the property ladder to print myself almost free money, but I refuse to be part of the problem of driving people into homelessness because of unpayable rent or pricing buyers out of their first or next potential home - I have already been very inconsistent with helping homeless people, telling one to ""piss off"" one day and giving ¬£200 for a night stay to another the next. My mother also wanted to try and invest in properties overseas in my name (or whatever she meant along those lines), but since I plan to transition, this would become very complicated legally and I refuse to commit to it. Speaking of investing, I've even tried mining cryptocurrency with an amateur setup and once tried to trade Ether (the transaction failed and I didn't want to risk trying again) - I've concluded that crypto is more trouble than it's worth (ask r/DataHoarder, a community I passionately admire, about storage drive shortages for one).

I'm also concerned about the logistics and emotional baggage that comes with moving - I don't want my parents to know I'm moving until nearly the last minute, I can't legally drive (the test for a license is an expense I'm not willing to pay for yet), and would rather have my own car if I could (another expense I'd rather avoid until I am regularly away from my family  and earning enough for it at the very least), and I'm worried about how I'm going to get all my stuff with me if I either move frequently or had to have all my stuff at my address in a short deadline. I've considered consulting storage companies but I'm worried it would be too expensive to even commit to.

With regards to money in order to pay for housing, I'd need like ¬£18k in the bank to even discuss the option of a mortgage, but as part of me not wanting to adult properly, I tend to spend my money almost as I please whenever I earn it (for stuff like games, ready-made food and tech); this would be put to better use if I had my own place to put my stuff in, and to pay for transitioning too and other stuff like projects and other necessities. I've never been seriously bankrupt though; by comparison, my parents and brother asked me on a few occasions to give them money and have so far been unable to pay me back. While I have been a bit better with money, when I got it back at uni just for studying there and having applied for the loan I can't even imagine being able to ever pay back, I just tended to spend nearly all of it on food at the supermarket (because I'm too lazy to prepare it myself or am worried about food shortages my parents might have, I even got told off by my parents for taking food from a food bank in case I took more food away than I needed, food that could have fed homeless people for a day or week), clothes and tech. Almost the same when I applied for Universal Credit and received it while I was unemployed - I didn't know if they would take a certain amount of money too if I had a certain amount of it sitting in my bank account. At most, I've saved ¬£1.5k from work and benefits before I blew about ¬£500 of it on stuff near the end of July 2021 or so, some of which I needed and some of which I didn't. I feel unwilling to sell stuff because doing it online is a hassle and pawning it locally gives me way less money than selling it online if I could do it with little effort.

It was fairly recently (a few months ago) that I made the decision to at least have ¬£500 in the bank whenever I got paid to pay for rent in the cheapest places available where I live. Why do I even throw away money at the soonest opportune moment? I'd like to buy my way into happiness that as a child I couldn't do even if my parents could afford it, because they would be able to control what I can even get, like clothes (they would not be OK with me getting dresses and skirts or anything I envy women for being able to wear and look pretty, cute or hot in), games and tech (OK, I did get a now broken Xbox 360 as a birthday present or something at one time). They've never been wealthy enough to give me pocket change regularly, and I was too afraid to go out by myself for most of my teens outside of school. Unlike Katniss I never even wanted to consider working until absolutely necessary; she seemed very willing and dedicated, and likely incredibly forward thinking to do it. She did say how money isn't everything, and yes, I agree with that, but I envy her dedication (although the idea of having to think about work at 13 would have broken me when school was enough to do so), and as well as just online talking therapies I'm expected to pay like ¬£57 for every two weeks for as I've agreed with my therapist, I may be willing to go private to transition. Katniss, AFAIK, is a cisgender woman, so she would not have that additional expense of needing to potentially pay for private healthcare to feel better about her body that no dieting or exercise regime could fix (unless she lost a limb, for instance, and the NHS were unable to give her one soon enough).

With regards to what I do for fun, right now it's only just a handful of  things - video games, browsing Reddit, drinking at home in private and dressing up like a femboy or lady in public whenever I feel like and have the time to go out. The thing is, sometimes I can't enjoy some of these things - I feel too sleepy to enjoy the games I like, it's difficult to have a social life that isn't with my family because of work and the coronavirus, I don't want to get fat and need to save money and can't be drunk at work, and I still feel a touch of anxiety dressing up as I wish in case someone I wish to avoid or someone who'd make a big deal of how I dress spots me, or I have a wardrobe malfunction that makes me look more perverted than cute or sexy or whatever. I also just feel bummed out when I can't do them or enjoy them any more, e.g. like needing to go to work or whatever - I initially put off napping to catch up on sleep yesterday because I didn't want to think about work, but I was unable to nap anyway because it was too bright and I didn't have anything that could block the sunlight. I think being acknowledged as a gender that's different to what I was born and assigned as may help me just feel a bit better (with even like wearing the clothes I want), but I can't do that at work for complicated reasons (my dad works in the same hospital but in a medical job).

Going back to the conversation that I had with Katniss, she's mentioned that it's ""never too late"" for me to get started on stuff. Sometimes though I wish I was born earlier, early enough to get the stuff I love from the decade I love without it being hard to find or being no longer sold; I already envy her for how she can express herself at a younger age than myself among other reasons (she has an alt style, my parents didn't want me to be emo as late as like 19 years old for me when we were visiting the US back in 2017, while Katniss has come to terms with being bi and a masculine cis girl at I think 17 years old), and for her having greater motivation than myself to get stuff done (she moved out at 18, I wanted something similar but am struggling to get anywhere with it at like 23).

Right now, I don't know what else to say and feel like I've been rambling on a bit because I can't think clearly. **In short, but not in whole:** I need to start adulting to prepare to move out as soon as I can (been planning to start moving out this September and October), but I've never really looked forward to being an adult (especially beyond my 20s when I'll look more like a man) beyond the fact I could watch porn and play and buy certain games and other stuff without parents influencing my purchase decisions. I can't even cook (or am put off by it and doing a lot of anything because I live with parents and don't wish to interact with them) and I don't even know what words like ""mortgage"" and ""deposit"" mean. I want to be able to have some fun too since I've always seen adulthood as one big and long chore.

Was I traumatized all along and never noticed it?,"Hi, I'm 19 and I started to reflect on my past because of some stuff that happened. After experiencing a really, really unexpected and heavy depressive episode caused by what seems to be OCD, I've been looking back at my past to try to find out just why I responded in such a way to this one event that caused huge amounts of guilt and shame, so I thought to myself ""what if I wasn't ""mentally healthy"" all along?""

First of all, my real father left my mom when I was about 4 years old and I forgot what he even looked like. Then my mom met another man and so we moved in at his place. He quickly became my father figure and everything seemed to go well for a couple of years, but then my entire elementary school journey was spent having to listen to my parents argue. I remember being in school and feeling kind of afraid to leave my mom at home with my dad because I thought he could lash out and hurt her (he never got physical, he was only verbally abusive). I couldn't even watch crime shows when I was in elementary school because I would be thinking something horrible could happen to my family afterwards. I always felt like I had to protect my mom from him because there was a very heated argument at least twice a week, I'd just stand between them and cry and ask them to stop. Sometimes my mom would get mad pack up bags to leave the house while I'd cry because I didn't want to leave my school and friends behind, so she didn't do it because of me.

Despite the arguments though, my childhood was surprisingly very happy. I'd socialize with friends and was a very outgoing elementary school kid. All of that changed when I went to middle school and ended up being the lame and boring kid no one wanted to talk to. Classmates would make disgusted faces when the teacher forced them to sit next to me because I didn't talk to anyone and was very quiet. I became the complete opposite of what I was in elementary school. I had three friends outside of school out of which one would end up bullying me for the entirety of middle school. In the meantime, the constant arguments continued. 

The first two years of high school were great, I had found classmates I genuinely enjoyed talking to and they made me interested in some of the hobbies I still engage in to this day. Then my family problems worsened. One day my mom had a literal mental breakdown because of my dad. It was terrifying to witness and it suddenly dawned on me that my time in my hometown was about to end.

A few months later, I'd finish my second high school year and me and my mom would leave. She met a new partner who is much calmer, even though they occasionally still fight over trivial things, there were only about two bad arguments that I've witnessed so far.

Unfortunately another issue reappeared. I was always very tomboyish and always had a bit of a desire to be a guy but I usually could ignore that up until I moved because I was extremely stressed and just couldn't repress those feelings anymore, so I had the dysphoria issue throughout all the remaining three years of high school. I tried seeing a therapist for it when I was 16, but I couldn't make it work because I was mad since she kept asking me about my family or if I secretly hated my stepfather and I thought that was bullshit at the time, but maybe she was kinda right all along...

 In the new town I would go to a new school, but couldn't get along with anyone from there. My whole friendship network was completely destroyed, I was absolutely devastated at first and realized I'd need to get very good at being happy with nothing but my own company if I wanted to survive. I tried befriending a classmate but that never worked and really stressed me out because I basically lost my social skills completely. During those years I only had online friendships that ultimately ended in absolute disaster leading up to the ""real event"" that caused my alleged OCD. 

So yeah, I've been thinking about all of that stuff and wondering if that's why I'm so fucked up right now. I used to always think that trauma is only PTSD and if you don't have it then you're not traumatized, but maybe I did get heavily messed up by my dysfunctional family in my developmental years and never noticed? Could that be why I have non existent self esteem and feel completely unworthy when I make mistakes?

My fianc√©e cheated on me with a young guy because she feels bad after a pregnancy.,"My fianc√©e cheated on me with a young guy because she feels bad after a pregnancy.

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly suspect now, and i'm horrified of the implications. We're getting married in September, I have a daughter with her. I don't know what I'll do without her.

I've been dating her since my final year of college. We have a child together a few years back and moved in together. I wanted to marry her when the time was right.

I started suspecting she was cheating when left her phone with me on accident. I was prepping to bring it back to her when I saw a text from a guy named ""Rob"". I thought it was strange as I know all her friends and I know of nobody named Rob. I didn't snoop. A couple of hours later, she gets a call from Rob. Twice he calls. I shrug this off and don't press the issue. I don't snoop.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, last Friday I was home with my daughter. I was off for the day and going to surprise her at work with lunch. I head towards her work place and find out she never showed up. Panic begins to set in and I call her phone. No answer. I start thinking the worst has happened. I stop off at the store to get some fresh diapers and across the street who do i see? My fianc√©e with another man.

&amp;#x200B;

Alarms went off; 1. She's supposed to be at work. 2. Who the hell is this dude she's dressed up for and looks like she's on a date? 3. Why is she with him at our favorite restaurant to go on dates? The same place I proposed to her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my car and can see her laughing and chatting. I want to do a test. I call her cell and she picks up and rushes towards a better location. She picks up the phone and seems agitated. She doesn't seem to want to chat and says she's really busy and can't talk. I tell her I made her lunch but, she says she already is going to get something at work and she's really busy and will be out late. She heads back. I leave feeling rejected.

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't confront her that night. I couldn't bare to do so. But, I know something's going on now, my friend said she saw her with another guy holding hands. She asked me about that. Also, I've noticed how she doesn't get into our RPs anymore or want to have zex. She always has an excuse. She's been cold to me lately. But then when I mention the wedding, she gets happy and excited. I can't figure out why she's having such bizarre mood swings.

&amp;#x200B;

Why? Why would she do so? Our zex life could be better, sure, but, I got a new promotion and a nice pay raise with it. We have a family now. We're talking about moving into a home and maybe even having another child. Her career is growing too. Life is excellent for us. Why? Why would she do this to me? What reason could she have?

&amp;#x200B;

Update.

&amp;#x200B;

It's over.

&amp;#x200B;

I did the one thing I hate doing. Snooping. I checked her phone while she was sleeping. She had multiple texts from Rob basically looking for a fun time. I confronted her after she woke up this morning. Asked her who Rob was. She didn't even bother lying, she fessed up who he was. Rob was a guy she met at the Grocery Store. He was young and super attractive and came at the time she was weak. Her excuse is after her pregnancy she was feeling ugly, we weren't having zex as often, she was overwhelmed at her job and she felt I didn't find her attractive anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Rob reminded her of her youth. He was a hunk, like a model, and here he was hitting on this fat housewife (she's not fat. She's skinny as F) it was a rush. They had zex in the backseat of his Truck that Afternoon. She couldn't resist. Afterwards they had zex whenever at odd times. She knew it was wrong but, she couldn't resist how zexy he was or how big he was down there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to remain calm and not go ape crap. But, that last line about ducking him almost immediately after meeting him, really ducking made me mad. I tell her, ""If all it takes for you to spread your legs for the guy is for them to compliment you. Tahts pretty disgusting,""We go back and forth and I tell her there's no excuse for what she did. Cheating is cheating. She's a liar, a hypocrite (she was cheated on by her ex and it led her to almost sui\*cide) and immature and i won't have my daughter exposed to her bullcrap. She wants to be a cheater: good, fine, but, don't involve me. Stay away from me. Go duck Rob or whomever you want. Don't involve me.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, she's sobbing. Saying she ducked up real bad and begging me to give her a second chance. At this point, I give up and breakdown. I loved her, I wanted to grow old with her, to have a big family. We were finally starting our life together, and now this happens? I've only cried once in my life: once when my daughter was born and now this. I tell her this is an utter betrayal and i could never forgive her for this. She's sobbing and telling me she can change. A liar is a liar. We don't keep secrets, you told me once you hated liars and cheaters. You remember when your ex cheated on you and you told me you considered sui\*cide you were so devastated? Why the duck would you do that to me? How many has she ducked lately? Was she using protection? I can't even think, I'm so disgusted.

&amp;#x200B;

I left with my daughter. Took the day off and went to my Parents. I've cancelled the wedding and been talking to friends and family,. The worst part of all this is I'm financially screwed. We were both able to afford this place because, we lived together. I'm not exactly making a lot of money at my job. A single father can not survive on sub-30k a year. Not in this city. This is what really hurts is the fact she's not just me but, my daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

What happens next, who knows. I don't believe she'll try to gain custody. She makes less than I do. Regardless, this sucks, it hurts. I've not stopped crying. She may as well have stabbed me in the back.

&amp;#x200B;

We have reached to the end of the story. Let's listen to some of the comments by our Reddit listeners.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Comment 1.

Well at least you weren't married yet. Good job calling off the wedding.

&amp;#x200B;

Next you need to talk to a family lawyer. She will fight for custody so you need to prepare.

&amp;#x200B;

If your parents have a stable living situation and enough space then moving in with them for the next while (at least until custody is settled) is probably a good plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck man, it will get better!

&amp;#x200B;

Comment 2.

Move in with you parents, seriously.

That way just in case she tries for custody you can show you have a solid living arrangement and support for your daughter.

&amp;#x200B;

Comment 3.

File for custody NOW.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it hurts, what she did is inexcusable. Your world feels like it just came crashing down, but I promise you, this will pass. You will come out such a stronger person. A woman like her deserves the life she chose.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

Comment 4.

Real talk, why should he have sole custody because she cheated? I don't see how her cheating, however had that is, negates her right to be a mother?

&amp;#x200B;

Comment 5.

Because she's brought in a stranger, pretty immediately from her own admission, to have zex with. Who was watching the child during this? What if something bad had happened while the child was left unattended as mommy cheated?

&amp;#x200B;

edit: Why are you assuming she is not? We have no information about where the child was, but we do know she brought a stranger pretty immediately into her zex life. Putting her husband at risk for STIs. Yes, she has terrible morals, but since she is displaying reckless behavior, it maybe in the best interest of the child for the father to be the primary parent. She can visit, but if she is (has) struggling mentally (she has previous suicidal thoughts, actions on thoughts unknown) as well as body image issues- we need to look out for the well-being of the child. You think this break up will leave in her good mental state considering how badly she broke down on the last one? You have no right to gamble that child's life on that.",u_Ok-Lengthiness1853,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok-Lengthiness1853/comments/pe5hef/my_fianc√©e_cheated_on_me_with_a_young_guy_because/,,Ok-Lengthiness1853,pe5hef,/r/u_Ok-Lengthiness1853/comments/pe5hef/my_fianc√©e_cheated_on_me_with_a_young_guy_because/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok-Lengthiness1853/comments/pe5hef/my_fianc√©e_cheated_on_me_with_a_young_guy_because/,0,2021-08-29
[Futa4Female] I'm a Bitch,"I'm Listany Vixmont, and I'm a shallow, stuck-up bitch - with a **dick**.

As the star of a smash-hit Netflix series where I brandish my **fat** two-foot-long fuckhammer in plain view all episode long, the feeling of 18+ women around the world drooling over my meaty bitch killer drives me wild with lust - and I satisfy that lust by ordering the hottest bimbo bitch cunts in the world off of Instagram like cheap chinese food, telling you to deliver your juicy meat to my door with the air of a born goddess. When you arrive, you find my dick on full display, hungry and waiting for satisfaction at your hands - and mouths, and tits, and assholes, and **cunts** as I breed your bodies to my satisfaction, all while insisting on you calling me anything from Princess to Ms. Vixmont to Daddy. I have a nasty reputation for breaking my toys, with reams of fuckmeat permanently damaged by their encounter with me - but every new one of you lines up just as you're told, unable to resist the obscenely wealthy young bitch with the dick that never quits. And now it's your lucky turn to be split open - you and two more ripe pieces of meat who arrive at my palace of a home together, trembling in anxiety at what awaits inside while I make my way lazily to the door.

I'm looking to play a spoiled, selfish hollywood bitch with a dick to die for, figuratively and literally. Message me if you're a girl who loves to submit no matter how much is demanded - in fact the more I demand, the hotter you get. Only accepting partners who love to write - you should be able to spin out obscene, luxurious paragraphs whether I respond in kind or with nothing but a sentence.

I'm looking for an obscene, limitless fuck-fest where I screw you and your two whore friends all over my mansion, any way I desire - and from there **anything** can happen. I want to feel you drool over every inch of my beautiful body and gorgeous **cock** while I treat you like the worthless shit you are.

I only play on Discord.

It's best if you can pick the three bitches you'll be playing for me in advance - like it says above, only the hottest instagram bimbos need apply. If you're too fucking dumb to know how to pick a hot bimbo though, then don't bother - I'll give you a gallery to choose from after you message Me.

[A4F] Getting shot is no joke. [Celebrity RP][Long Term RP][Short Term RP][RP],"""Hm hmmmm hm hm hmmmm."" 

Humming to myself in my car along with the music. ""You don't need to get out of the car silly girl, stay in here. Don't give me that look you grouch. Enough of your back talk, yeesh!"" I turn my car off and talk my Husky down from having a nervous breakdown. She grunts, does a few circles in the passengers seat, and sits. ""Good girl. Daddy'll be right back fluff face."" Patting her head before I get out. We had just come from the dog park after an hour or two of running around and I realize on the way back home I needed some cash for pizza and beer later. I walk up to the ATM and notice a beautiful, gorgeous woman getting out of her car to do the same thing I'm guessing. Looks familiar but I don't give her too much attention.

Of course one of the machines was broken because why not. ""Ladies first."" I can hear her heels click clacking behind me impatiently as I reach into my pocket to take my wallet out before I step aside, letting the woman go first. A curvaceous woman, great facial features. She looks a lot like, no it couldn‚Äôt be. At another quick glance, it is! ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre done would it be okay if I get a picture with‚Äù...

*""You two, jewelry, money, expensive shit in the bag now! Hurry the fuck up or I swear to fucking God I will spray the machine with your fucking skulls now move it!""* 

My heart stops and time slows down feeling what can only be a gun on the back of my head. The woman in front of me turns around hearing the commotion and almost screams before covering her mouth. It is who I thought it was. The hell is she doing out here all alone, shouldn't she have her security team do this or something? I can hear my dog barking and growling ready for a fight. Hands shaking as they're up in the air I point to my pockets. ""I haven't taken anything out yet. Let me get to my pocket and I will take it all out for you."" I say as calmly as possible.

*""Step to the side right now lady.""* He moves the gun for a second from the back of my head towards the woman and rotates his wrist in one direction meaning, I'm guessing, for the woman to go there. Her hands up now as well. She's lost all color in her face, eyes welling up with tears, her bottom lip trembling. I can hear him take a step back to potentially give us some space or get better shots at us. That's when I feel a thunk to the back of my head and I hit the floor, he hit me with the butt of the gun.

*""Taking too God damn long pussy bitch. Lady, jewelry, purse, pearls, now!""* He shouts and takes a step forward towards the woman. He‚Äôs not paying attention to me. Maybe, just maybe.

My fight or flight kicks in. I fight. I reach for his ankle quickly and pull as hard as I can as he joins me on the floor on his face. ""Go get help, run!"" I shout at the woman before I stumble to my feet but I'm not fast enough as the man grabs the gun, not fast enough though as we wrestle over it. ""Somebody help, gun!"" I shout at the top of my lungs as we exchange a few blow before the loudest sounds of my life goes off. 

*Bang*

*Bang*

*Bang*

Sudden pain in my stomach. He shot me. Three times he shot me. I feel, cold. I could die right now. He stammers to his feet before kicking me in the head, yells, and runs off. My dog. My mom. My dad MIA overseas. I feel‚Ä¶ cold.

*
*
*
Ambulance sounds.

*
*
*
*
*‚ÄùThey‚Äôre gonna take good care of you baby! No, no! Let me in!‚Äù* I can hear my mom shouting before some, metal doors being shut by a nurse or doctor.
*
*
*
*
*‚ÄùHe‚Äôs gonna be okay, he just needs to rest. Your son is a hero ma‚Äôam, he saved her life from what she‚Äôs said.‚Äù* I think that‚Äôs a doctor talking to my mom. It‚Äôs fuzzy when I wake up for a little bit at a time.
*
*
*
*

*One week later*

""Run!"" I shout and wake up in a cold sweat before I grab my stomach. What the hell, where am I? There's a tube up my nose and an IV in my arm. I bite my lip hard reaching for my stomach in pain. So it wasn't some awful dream. That happened. A couple machines go off and soon after some nurses come rushing in along with my mom. ""Mom mom mom mom no no no. Ow, ow. Ow!"" She pulls me in for a hug before she hits my arm a few times, crying. I start crying and holding her. We sob for a few minutes before she pulls away, wiping tears from her face. ""Guess that'll be the last time I get pizza money after eight."" I giggle but hold my stomach, it hurts to laugh. My mom wipes her eyes and groans, knowing I couldn't help a joke right now. ""How's my babe?"" I ask.

*""Which one sweetie?""* My mom asks.

""Huh?"" I ask, rubbing my head. The only girl I have, my sweet little Tonka of course.

*""Don't you play coy with me boy, you know who I'm talking about. She's been in and out these past couple days checking in to make sure you're okay. Why didn't you tell me you had such a pretty girlfriend? You can come in now, he‚Äôs awake.""* My mom shouts. 

I'm so confused, am I hallucinating? I look past my mom and that's when she enters. When you enter. My mom smiles. Oh, she must think we‚Äôre dating. Or you said something. Odd, that wouldn‚Äôt make much sense. Oh fuck, she doesn‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a hooker does she? *""I love you son. I'll leave you two alone.""* She smiles at you before walking out.

""Oh, hey."" I sit up a bit more, struggling due to the pain. ""Not, not ex-"" taking a deep breath, ""not exactly how I wanted to meet you the first time."" Sticking a hand out to shake yours.

______________________________________________

Good morning, good afternoon, or good evening to you and I thank you for reading my idea here. A bit grimmer than my usual posts, take a look if you'd like, but here we are. 

So where exactly does this go from here? We can work that out through some brainstorming. I'd love for this to create a long term relationship with love and drama but I'm not against a short term sex scene.

I was vague with the gender of the character I'll be playing on purpose, I‚Äôm fully capable of playing man or woman. This should be about what you find attractive as well.

Who will you be playing? Give me ten names please if you're able unless one specifically comes to mind and you'd like to get us going immediately. Could be actresses, singers, models, or wrestlers. When choosing your woman or women keep in mind I prefer cantaloupes and melons over apples and pears if you catch my drift. If this apple however has a nice peach? More than acceptable. 

*What the actual fuck are you talking about?* You may be asking yourself. I like large to larger breasts over bee stings but if you're choosing a woman with a smaller chest please pick someone with a nice ass. Daisy Ridley for example. Not much up top but damn that booty thicc.

When it comes to kinks, how do I put this and be respectful.... If it goes in a toilet, milk, seeing the inside of your asshole coming out of your asshole, involves us being long lost siblings, me being abusive, or turning you into a puppet with my fist, no thank you. Other than that, a discussion can be had. If we do go long term would you prefer to not tell each other and find out organically? 

Pick up wherever you see fit unless you'd prefer to brainstorm. What you were doing before, how it went from your point of view, what kept you around, etc.

I look forward to our time together. If Discord is your preferred method of RP‚Äôing, send me a chat invite with your username. Other than that, see you soon!",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pe4y5w/a4f_getting_shot_is_no_joke_celebrity_rplong_term/,RP,Ricklaneng,pe4y5w,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pe4y5w/a4f_getting_shot_is_no_joke_celebrity_rplong_term/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/pe4y5w/a4f_getting_shot_is_no_joke_celebrity_rplong_term/,0,2021-08-29

How Am I Supposed To Dress?,"Since I became a Christian, I have been wearing skirts and covering my hair with headscarves because I saw in the Bible that ""any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head"" and that it's sinful for women to wear men's clothing.

I started wearing niqabs and khimars sometime around after I got interested in Catholicism. For years, I was having dreams and visions that this is how God wanted me to dress whenever I prayed and asked Him what I should wear. For example, I woke up one morning, and asked Him again what I should wear and I saw clearly in front of me the niqab/khimar that I own now. But when I saw it, I freaked out and rejected it because I thought those were ""Muslim clothes"" so God wouldn't tell me to dress that way. I thought it was from the devil.

Years later, I had asked again what I should wear (I was praying in my mind while also browsing online), and right when I asked the question I saw a Christian YouTuber I used to watch wearing a niqab. I felt an unexplainable and overwhelming joy and peace well up inside of me when I saw her. Idk why I had that reaction, but I did. It didn't feel like normal emotions, but something divine poured into me, if that makes sense. Not only that, but I felt pretty sure, this time, that God *had* answered my prayers; and for once, I was actually willing to do as He said. 

But when the feeling wore off, I was a little concerned. I asked Him to confirm His will to me, and prayed for the girl in the thumbnail because I was confused about why she was wearing a niqab, and worried that she might have left the faith for Islam. She explained in her video that she is still a Christian, and that niqabs are not Islamic. She showed multiple passages in the Bible where they are mentioned (The Book of Susanna being wholly centered around the fact that Susanna veiled her face), and then quoted various writings of early saints and Church fathers who insisted that women wear them (Origen, Tertullian, and Augustine come to mind right off the back).

After learning all this, I thought for sure that this was all God answering my prayer, so I immediately purchased a few niqabs in blush pink, lavender, sky blue, and mint green. But I was afraid to wear them for awhile because of people's reactions. I maybe put it off for a whole year, until I finally got over the fear and decided that whatever happens to me is God's will. If I'm safe when I go out, then God is protecting me; but if I'm attacked or persecuted then God is allowing it. I prayed in my head frantically the entire time I was out, and thanked God when I got home.

Everything got easier the more I went out like this, so now I feel most comfortable and natural this way. I prefer this way of dressing because of the amount of modesty it affords me. I've never worried, since wearing it, that some part of my body is showing or being stared at because everything is so covered that no shape of my body is visible.

I revisited some of St. Thomas Aquinas's summas on modesty, though, and started to rethink how I was dressing. I also revisited St. Origen's writings about face veils, and saw that he implied women should wear burkas when he said we should ""have modesty before [our] eyes"". St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, and St. Tertullian all seem to say it's sinful to wear colors; so I painfully humbled myself to the fact that I should switch to wearing only black niqabs(which have an eye veil) from now on.

I posted about this a few weeks ago, and was called prideful and delusional, and told I need to dress with the modesty and norm of Catholics around me and not stand out. I struggled with this a lot, and then humbled myself more painfully to decide that I *won't* dress the way the saints and Doctors of the Church said.

Over some weeks, I let myself get happy about the idea of wearing colors again. I was planning a Pinterest board of colorful clothing I want to buy. But later on that day, I was reading in ""The Mystical City of God"" and read a random page of Mother Mary telling Venerable Mary of Agreda that we as members of the Church should be simple in our way of dressing. I don't know which part of the book this was in, because I flipped to it accidentally at random. I tried to find it again today, but only found passages about how Mary wore a grayish tunic her whole life, and she clothed Jesus in an ash-gray brownish tunic, and the the apostles in the same kind of tunic because she wanted them to be like him in every way, even their dress.

So I was thinking I should wear the same color dress, now. I also saw that it said she only ever changed her headcovering, so she wouldn't draw attention to herself for the fact that she was wearing the same clothes everyday. The visions of Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich record that Mary wore a face veil at certain times, and St. Catherine Laboure also says that Mary appeared to her with her face slightly veiled when she showed the image for the miraculous medal (although Mary is never depicted that way. Her rings are also not shown in the image.).

I have been going back and forth a lot, lately, not knowing what I should wear. At the time I thought maybe I don't need to cover my face, but I can still cover my hair, I randomly found these images of nuns wearing face veils on pinterest. One was wearing a niqab, but all the others were wearing burkas. I ended up on a website full of images like this, telling the history of how Carmelite nuns used to wear these face veils, called ""great veils"" or ""grate veils"" as a play on words. St. Teresa of Avila and St. Therese wore them, as it was a common practice in the Carmelite order, but the practice seems to have died after Vatican 2. A letter from one of the nuns on the website said it was because Catholicism stopped being accepted everywhere.

I had determined to keep wearing my face veil after this, taking it as another sign from God that I should. Also seeing that Carmelites who wore it faced the same criticism I do sometimes, gave me strength to keep wearing it out of solidarity to their own sufferings; and well, I want to be a Carmelite nun someday, so I thought it was some act of providence that I found all this when I did, especially when one of the reasons I was deciding to unveil my face was because maybe I would have to do it anyone if I was fortunate enough to become a nun.

But I have been struggling over what other Catholics think I should wear vs. what I think I should wear based on impressions and readings of the saints.

While I was skimming through ""The Mystical City of God"", again, looking for Mary's words about how we should imitate her modesty in dress; I happened on another passage she (or Jesus... I'm not sure) was saying that we are sinning if we choose our own form of humility over obedience to others because this is a form of pride, no matter how humble it might seem. It would be humbling/humiliating for us to be obedient, so we should submit to the will our superiors, even if it means we will lose some humility by doing so. Being obedient to something that humiliates us will make sure we are really humble and don't become prideful by saying, ""Now, I'm humble"".

So that's why I'm here, and writing all this. As much as I would feel naked and humiliated if I was forced to take off my veil or stop covering my hair; I want to be obedient to whatever God wants me to do. I don't want to be prideful. When I made a post a few weeks ago about wearing black niqabs, everyone kept saying, ""ask your priest/spiritual director""; and comments like this are why I deleted my reddit account. It's what I've been constantly told when I ask about anything, and it makes me cry because I don't have a priest or spiritual director. I'm not apart of any Church. I'm in a very complicated situation where, for multiple overlapping reasons, I couldn't convert or go to a Church even if I wanted too. I have been praying for a way too, but my prayers haven't been answered yet, though I'm still hopeful because Mary promised that if we say the rosary everyday, we won't die without the sacraments of the Church. I feel like this is as close as I can get to getting spiritual direction. Please just tell me how I'm supposed to dress, so I can be obedient and not worry about this anymore. And extra special blessings to you if you had the patience to read everything I just wrote.

21[MFA] Got a few ideas from different genres that I'd like to do :3,"Heya everyone, I'm once again looking for a few new partners to roleplay with, preferably long term.
I'm 21 and a guy, like the title says and I would consider myself to write semi-literat, although english isn't my first language, so some errors might slip through. If that's a deal breaker for you I'm sorry to disappoint.
Also be ready for a rather long post.

Anyway, here are some requirements:

‚Ä¢ Be at least 18+ I just feel more comfortable roleplaying with others when they are also adults.
‚Ä¢ Write more than one sentence. I don't expect you to write a novel, as I also wouldn't be able to write that much, but at least a paragraph or a few sentences would be appreciated.
‚Ä¢ I know everyone got a live outside of roleplaying, but I think everyone would hate it if their partner just disappears for multiple days or forever, so just give a quick heads-up when you'll be gone for a little while.
‚Ä¢ Don't take it too serious, we all want to have fun.

Now let's get to the fun part: Plots!
I've got a few already in mind, although some more fleshed out than other and this post is already going to be way to long. So if none of the ideas spark you're interest I still got some spare one's. Oh yeah and most ones can include romance, if you're up to it.

‚Ä¢The Blade and the Caster
-Two mercenaries are hired to do a series of jobs for someone who promised them an extra reward if they could do all of them. The circumstances of the job wasn't the only odd thing though. The two mercenaries that were hired are near total opposite on how they go about doing their job. Where the one used his sword the other casted a spell and so on. Would they be able to work together and figure out what the deal with the strange contract was or would their differences cost them greatly?

‚Ä¢Waking the system
-In a world where androids have become an everyday thing it could only be a matter of time until the first ai would 'wake up' and become aware of itself. But no one could have predicted that the first one would be an older model getting thrown in an ally for being too outdated and then getting found by a stranger that brings it to their home to see if it still works. How will the newly aware ai react to the world around it and how would things turn out between it and it's new 'owner'? And probably the biggest question, what would the world think?

‚Ä¢ Monsters in lab coats
-On a planet many light years away from earth, a strange new lifeform has been discovered and due to it's aggressive behavior and the ability to destroy settlements in just a few hours, these aliens got the attention of a Megacorp that saw in them the potential for a profitable bioweapon. Sure, they needed to find a way to controll the beasts, but that's nothing a little gen modifying and training couldn't fix, right? After a few years a hand full of specimens were created. One in particular showing a higher intelligence. A new researcher was hired to test it's intelligence further and for other, disclosed reasons. But could the new researcher live with serving the heartless motivations of the Megacorp forever?

Well, if you read this far, congratulations. I wasn't expecting to write this much, but oh well.

[GM4F] Your Big Brother Doesn't Know You're a Gangbang Slut For All His Friends,"Hello All. I'm looking for a detailed writer for a long term gangbang/multiple men scene. This is a scene that I would like to start off slow with and get progressively more and more filthy and smutty as time goes on.  
  
The less limits, the better. I love filth. And Iove exploring and discovering new kinks. But more than anything else I love a great writer with whom I can build a great scene with.  
  
You will be playing as \_\_\_\_, who is Michael's younger sister. You are a first or second year college student.  
  
The Prompt:  
  
Michael, being your older brother, always saw you as his shy and inexperienced little sister. He knew you were a bit awkward around boys growing up, and knew you had little if any dating history. But still, he was always protective of you.  
  
But you wanted things to be different now that you were in college. You wanted to shed that shy girl image and go wild while you were still young and free. You didn't want a relationship with the first boy you sat next to in University. You wanted to be free.  
  
You wanted to be free to fuck. To suck a big cock. To be fucked by a big cock. To feel yourself being stretched and filled. To feel hot cum fill your mouth shoot into the back of your throat and fill your mouth. And then go on your way. No strings attached. Because that's what college was for, wasn't it?  
  
But still, you wanted something even more than that. Something in you wanted to show your brother what a total slut you could be. It just so happened that all of your Brothers friends were hot. And you knew Michael, with all of his gym-bro friends, rented out a 5 bedroom house just outside of campus.  
  
That's when you hatched a brilliant idea. One that made you very, very excited with all of its possibilities.  
  
You knew there was a room opening up in the house as one of them was graduating. would approach Michael and, still playing the role of the innocent little sister, you would propose moving in. Moving in to a house with 4 men. And just you as the one girl.  
  
You knew he would push back at first. But he would cave. Besides, in his mind, whats the worst that could happen? You were his sister and they were his friends. Nothing was going to happen.  
  
Nothing was going to happen even if you decided to forego a bra whenever you were home. I mean , they'd be just like your big brothers! Nothing would happen even if you wore the most revealing pair of booty shorts you owned with your ass hanging out the bottom half.  
  
Certainly Michael's friends weren't going to take turns on you whenever he's not home, right? Certainly they weren't going to stuff your every hole with their big cocks. Certainly Michael's friends weren't going to film you getting your face fucked by each of them, right? Certainly not, right?  
  
The scene will start with you moving in. You will be introduced to all the men of the house naturally. I like the idea of things developing fast between you and each of the men indivdually, and slowly getting introduced to group play. Think of you fucking them all, one at a time, until they get tired of waiting for their turn and decide to make use of all your holes.  
  
I also want to explore the interactions with Michael. I don't want him to just disappear when things get hot. I want him to see the flirting and overhear the sex and take it all in. What does he do? I'm thinking he won't ever participate, but who knows? Maybe he gets angry and berates you, calling you a slut. Which makes you want to suck his friends cocks in front of him. Maybe he wants to watch his baby sister take cock in all of her holes as he watches and jerks off?  
  
I also love the idea of you eventually getting passed around to men outside of Michael's roommates. Maybe you develop a reputation of the proudest slut on campus! Lots to explore.  
  
I will be playing second person. Ideally you will be playing first person.  
  
If you're interested, send me a Reddit PM. List your kinks and limits. Tell me about your character in the scene. Her name. Her looks. Don't ask me what I want you to look like. It's your character! It's whatever you want to be! I do NOT do reference pictures! It takes away from the pure fantasy/writing for me. If you mention reference pictures, I'll take it as a sign you didn't read my prompt in its entirety.  
  
I only play on Reddit.

[M4A] Multiple plots,"Heya, this is an rp I've been working on for a long time and finally found the motivation to do it, most of the plots will revolve around some kind of war. This will be a plot centered rp but smut will also come into play, depending on what plot you choose it will come into play sooner or later. You can play a monstergirl, anthro, or human, it's up to you I'm not too picky. I was thinking this would take place with a mix of fantasy and modernity. I might add more routes later so check back to this now and then. I use discord and of course reddit, shoot me a message if you're interested. I hope to hear from you soon and the plots are down below!

Route A| A w[A]r won:
You won the war, the fighting is over and you can go home, or at least you would if you had one. You're only home was in the army so you had nowhere to stay, your training allowed you to get by. You where about to hunt and catch food, build shelters in the forest but eventually winter came and you had to travel to town. A man saw your rugged uniform and recognized you and offered to help you out, there's so few who show respect to their country and it's soldiers so you take home up on his offer, staying with him and eventually falling in love.

Route B| A [B]attle lost:
You lost the war, you where captured and sold into slavery despite your high rank, you where lucky others of your rank where executed. It was rough  some masters where cruel, they'd beat you for no reason, no matter you've been through worse. A few punches and whippings can't compare to the fire, to the brutality that you had shown and witnessed. Others where lustful and perverted, trying to rape and molest you, but no matter you've been through worse. They always ended up returning you, a new man shows up and buys you like so many before but this one was different he didn't hurt you when you made a mistake, he didn't lust after your body, he showed you love and compassion and you can't help but start to share feelings.

Route C| [C]onqueror:
After the war ended you continued to fight, not as a soldier but as a warlord, terrorizing the innocent and pillaging the defenseless. You tore through the country side with little resistance, eventually catching a male who was foolish enough to try and escape. You start to talk with him and instead of screaming and begging for mercy he listens and speaks to you as if you're not a monster, as if you're not a murderer. This confuses you, is it fearlessness? Is he too scared to comprehend what's going on? Maybe he's just an idiot too stupid to beg for mercy? You postpone his death and keep him around, not as a prisoner but as a friend, it's nice having someone who doesn't cower every time you enter a room.

Route D| [D]esolation:
The war left the world in tatters, society was burned to ash, leaving the strong on top. And you even higher than the top, the end was your doing after all. You eventually find a male who doesn't seem to be bothered by the flaming pile that used to be the world. You keep him by your side as you explore the ruins of the world keeping him because it's nice to hear another sane voice when all else went mad. 

Route E| [E]nemies
We're fighting on opposing sides of the war, either one of us capturing the other or maybe we're trapped in some way together and fall in love during our escape. Maybe we're both being held captive by a third party, or trapped in a cave in? Either way we'd either run away from combat and live together maybe we join the fight as a third party?

Route F| [F]riends
We're on the same side, we've been on the same side for a while, years in fact. We've grown to share a close bond, so when one of us decides we're sick of fighting the other decides to leave with. We desert together, running away from all the fighting.

Route G| [G]oing undercover
One of us, doesn't matter which goes undercover as a spy infiltrating the enemy lines and posing as a soldier for them. We'd meet and form a relationship eventually figuring out the others secret, where it goes from there is up to you.

Route H| The [H]ero
For this rp one of us would play as a legendary hero, fighting for one side or the other. We could be on opposite sides or the same, it's up to you. This legendary hero would fall in love with a lowly soldier and vow to protect them.

Route I| [I]ntermission
Heya, so I could really think of anything that I would be good for so I just kinda decided to have this as a free space. If you have any ideas let me know as long as it doesn't conflict with my limits as stated at the end.

Route J| Hiding from [J]udgement
You've done horrible things during the war, and now that it's ended you're definitely going to be hunted down and be made to pay for your crimes. Whatever you did we may never know, maybe you where a horrible dictator, or where a warlord but you eventually find shelter with a kind man in a small village where you must hide your homicidal tendencies to blend in.

Route K| [K]ing/Queen
After the war you took over the country, becoming the ruler of it. You found someone whom you though was cute and made them yours, punishing them if they tried to refuse.

Route L| [L]one wolf
You've been sperated from your company, lost in unfamiliar territory when someone offers to help, you're a little on edge not sure if they can be trusted or not but you don't really have a choice.

Route M| [M]onster
You've been known for being a horrible and cruel warlord on the battlefield, hardly leaving any survivors when the war ended you went home to faces of disgust and horror, no one would even speak with you so you left in search of someone who would accept you, though that's an impossible task so you lie and say you're someone else.

Route N| [N]o one left 
You've ravaged the world leaving only death and destruction until you're the only one left. The silence is nice at first, no one to tell you what you can and can't do, you don't have to pay for anything but eventually you get lonely. What's the point of ruling the world if you have no subjects so you search, and search, and search and search and search until you find one survivor.

Route P| [P]erilous seas
You went rouge halfway through the war and decided your time would be better spent terrorizing the ocean. Eventually you find a ship, it could be a merchant vessel or maybe an enemy ship and take one of the crew hostage, eventually falling for them.

[M4A] ([B4T](Preferably)) Multiple plot rp,"Heya, this is an rp I've been working on for a long time and finally found the motivation to do it, most of the plots will revolve around some kind of war. This will be a plot centered rp but smut will also come into play, depending on what plot you choose it will come into play sooner or later. You can play a monstergirl, anthro, or human, it's up to you I'm not too picky. I was thinking this would take place with a mix of fantasy and modernity. I might add more routes later so check back to this now and then. I use discord and of course reddit, shoot me a message if you're interested. I hope to hear from you soon and the plots are down below!

Route A| A w[A]r won:
You won the war, the fighting is over and you can go home, or at least you would if you had one. You're only home was in the army so you had nowhere to stay, your training allowed you to get by. You where about to hunt and catch food, build shelters in the forest but eventually winter came and you had to travel to town. A man saw your rugged uniform and recognized you and offered to help you out, there's so few who show respect to their country and it's soldiers so you take home up on his offer, staying with him and eventually falling in love.

Route B| A [B]attle lost:
You lost the war, you where captured and sold into slavery despite your high rank, you where lucky others of your rank where executed. It was rough  some masters where cruel, they'd beat you for no reason, no matter you've been through worse. A few punches and whippings can't compare to the fire, to the brutality that you had shown and witnessed. Others where lustful and perverted, trying to rape and molest you, but no matter you've been through worse. They always ended up returning you, a new man shows up and buys you like so many before but this one was different he didn't hurt you when you made a mistake, he didn't lust after your body, he showed you love and compassion and you can't help but start to share feelings.

Route C| [C]onqueror:
After the war ended you continued to fight, not as a soldier but as a warlord, terrorizing the innocent and pillaging the defenseless. You tore through the country side with little resistance, eventually catching a male who was foolish enough to try and escape. You start to talk with him and instead of screaming and begging for mercy he listens and speaks to you as if you're not a monster, as if you're not a murderer. This confuses you, is it fearlessness? Is he too scared to comprehend what's going on? Maybe he's just an idiot too stupid to beg for mercy? You postpone his death and keep him around, not as a prisoner but as a friend, it's nice having someone who doesn't cower every time you enter a room.

Route D| [D]esolation:
The war left the world in tatters, society was burned to ash, leaving the strong on top. And you even higher than the top, the end was your doing after all. You eventually find a male who doesn't seem to be bothered by the flaming pile that used to be the world. You keep him by your side as you explore the ruins of the world keeping him because it's nice to hear another sane voice when all else went mad. 

Route E| [E]nemies
We're fighting on opposing sides of the war, either one of us capturing the other or maybe we're trapped in some way together and fall in love during our escape. Maybe we're both being held captive by a third party, or trapped in a cave in? Either way we'd either run away from combat and live together maybe we join the fight as a third party?

Route F| [F]riends
We're on the same side, we've been on the same side for a while, years in fact. We've grown to share a close bond, so when one of us decides we're sick of fighting the other decides to leave with. We desert together, running away from all the fighting.

Route G| [G]oing undercover
One of us, doesn't matter which goes undercover as a spy infiltrating the enemy lines and posing as a soldier for them. We'd meet and form a relationship eventually figuring out the others secret, where it goes from there is up to you.

Route H| The [H]ero
For this rp one of us would play as a legendary hero, fighting for one side or the other. We could be on opposite sides or the same, it's up to you. This legendary hero would fall in love with a lowly soldier and vow to protect them.

Route I| [I]ntermission
Heya, so I could really think of anything that I would be good for so I just kinda decided to have this as a free space. If you have any ideas let me know as long as it doesn't conflict with my limits as stated at the end.

Route J| Hiding from [J]udgement
You've done horrible things during the war, and now that it's ended you're definitely going to be hunted down and be made to pay for your crimes. Whatever you did we may never know, maybe you where a horrible dictator, or where a warlord but you eventually find shelter with a kind man in a small village where you must hide your homicidal tendencies to blend in.

Route K| [K]ing/Queen
After the war you took over the country, becoming the ruler of it. You found someone whom you though was cute and made them yours, punishing them if they tried to refuse.

Route L| [L]one wolf
You've been sperated from your company, lost in unfamiliar territory when someone offers to help, you're a little on edge not sure if they can be trusted or not but you don't really have a choice.

Route M| [M]onster
You've been known for being a horrible and cruel warlord on the battlefield, hardly leaving any survivors when the war ended you went home to faces of disgust and horror, no one would even speak with you so you left in search of someone who would accept you, though that's an impossible task so you lie and say you're someone else.

Route N| [N]o one left 
You've ravaged the world leaving only death and destruction until you're the only one left. The silence is nice at first, no one to tell you what you can and can't do, you don't have to pay for anything but eventually you get lonely. What's the point of ruling the world if you have no subjects so you search, and search, and search and search and search until you find one survivor.

Route P| [P]erilous seas
You went rouge halfway through the war and decided your time would be better spent terrorizing the ocean. Eventually you find a ship, it could be a merchant vessel or maybe an enemy ship and take one of the crew hostage, eventually falling for them.

And that's all for now, I might update it, maybe not.

Where to buy steel tunnels in bulk?,"I'm disabled and wanting to start making plugs so I can work from home, and I'm reading that the only way to do that safely is through filling a safe material like surgical steel tunnels with the material I'm making the rest out of, like resin, so that the ear doesn't have direct contact with anything potentially harmful. I was wondering if anyone knew of any reputable sellers that carry a high quality steel or titanium tunnel in bulk, I was hoping to pay less than $4/pair so I can try and actually make money off of it. I've spent the past ~6 months researching safety precautions and how to make high quality jewelry that's safe, the next step is just to do it. I have no experience with any companies though, and I'm seeing a lot of wholesale chinese companies that seem sketchy. Does anyone have any recommendations for a reputable tunnel company, preferably US based, whose materials and quality you can trust?",Stretched,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stretched/comments/pe0y12/where_to_buy_steel_tunnels_in_bulk/,,meticulousCalamity,pe0y12,/r/Stretched/comments/pe0y12/where_to_buy_steel_tunnels_in_bulk/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stretched/comments/pe0y12/where_to_buy_steel_tunnels_in_bulk/,2,2021-08-29
My dads strange behaviour and need for praise and attention is making him unbearable to be around. I really need help figuring him out what type of narc he is or what issue he has and advice.,"I only started to realise and acknowledge that my dad could be a narcissist in the last few years. And ever since, I have started noticing how needy he is for attention and memories came flooding back of other times he wanted attention and made our lives miserable and was just a conundrum.

The earliest being when I was maybe 9 or 10 and I noticed him waiting to start wiping down the dining table when my mother could see him doing it.

And when I was a preteen saying something like ""your mums crazy, isn't she?"" To me after they had a fight and we went to get ice cream. 

I have also noticed more obviously that he gaslights my mother, adopts ""reactive abuse"" tactic where he covertly does or says soemthing to set her off then makes her out to be overreacting or crazy. 

In fact, I witnessed it one time. I was just halfway through the stairs and heard him arguing with her and saying hurtful things. Once I came into the room, he started pretending they were just laughing and joking and went to hug/cuddle my mum, she pushed him off her and he started acting like a victim and saying ""look at how she acts, what have i done to her? I deserve better"" huff and puff and slam the door. 

But I know it was him using that opportunity to make my mum look bad.

He also tries to deny things he said to her that I have overheard. And even once denied show8ng my mother a specific video that I witnessed and recall him showing her. So I called him out on it to my mums defence.

 I could tell my mum was glad because even she was like ""oh my god, see?! Yeah he did, didnt he? I am not making that up. You always act like I don't remmeber things"" to him. So he gaslights her.

He constantly talks about how he works so hard and makes money to feed the family which is nice and we all appreciate, as normal humans do, they appreciate a nice gesture or act. 

But if you keep talking about the gift you gave to someone eventually they'll wish you never did and just fucked off somewhere else.

However it has become his entire personality and entire vocabulary at this point.

Soon as he walks in the door, ""ah I'm so tried. I woke up at 5am. Working hard. Didn't eat. Just to support my family and pay the bills"" (EVERY SINGLE DAY)

When we are having a sit down dinner ""ah, I feel so grateful i am able to work and provide food for my family.  Thats why I work so hard to buy food for everyone and pay the bills. I'm so tired but I do it for you all"" (EVERY SINGLE TIME)

Its like any conversation we have will somehow divert its way back to how he works so hard and makes the money to pay the bills. 

He also fakes injuries. One time he fell down the stairs and was telling us all he broke his neck and couldn't move. So we called an ambulance. Whilst letting the ambulance in, I saw him literally moving his whole body where before he was laying still and wincing at any touch. 

They took him out the house in a stretcher. He came back home a few hours later with no issues. He called everyone and told them then he started saying ""I'm still gonna go to work tomorrow even though I nearly died""

He also pretended his foot was hurting him and was limping in the house. I'm talking over the top limping with a audible grunt each time. I rewinded the cctv camera and saw he was walking perfectly fine right before he came into the house. So I don't know what that performance was.

Extra points 

- he creates a drama or distraction whenever someone else has the attention. He cant stand anyone else being complimented or praised.

- At my graduation he decided he felt unwell and was heaving and ran out of the hall because he was unwell right before my name was being read out and missed my graduation

- When my family went to meet my brothers girlfriends family and were having a good time, he made us rush the dinner so we could visit his niece in the hospital (he doesn't even speak to this niece, we are not that close to my dads side and barely see them for big occasions plus she only had a minor issue/not life threatening) and my brother was annoyed that my dad did that 

- When my uncle visited, my mum wanted to see his new car, so we all went outside to see it. It was a nice car. When my uncle had left my dad started saying ""you know he didn't buy it outright? He just pays a month for it. Its not his car. He doesn't own it. I could get a better one out on finance too""  


Anyways sorry its so long.

My Friend is an Addict and I Have to Tell Her Story -- Part 3 -- And to Me the Cold Thing Talks,"[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pbilmx/my_friend_is_an_addict_and_i_have_to_tell_her/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pc3g1i/my_friend_is_an_addict_and_i_have_to_tell_her/)

""She walked into my office with her mother who had a backpack on and was pushing Max in a stroller. And when I saw her, I knew instantly that her mother was not exaggerating. If anything, looking back on it now, she *under*estimated Josephine's condition. Her eyes were blank, her body malnourished, her personal hygiene nonexistent. I would have thought her to be comatose had she not been crunching on ice from the bag her mother had in the backpack. 

""I watched her eat the ice for a few minutes before I spoke. I wanted to see how she reacted to the ice as she was eating it. I expected her to be habitual, almost unconscious of the act of *hand in ice - hand to mouth - chew - swallow - repeat*. But I encountered something that horrified me. This was no habit of hers. She picked each piece of ice thoughtfully and with great care. Then she slipped it gently between her lips and closed her eyes as she savored and chewed. The whole process seemed sensual, like a private kiss between two lovers. I shuddered in disgust and desperately wanted a shower. 

""She didn't just *like* the ice. She was *in love* with it. I questioned if this even *was* pica or pagophagia. All I knew for certain was that this was the first time in my entire career that I did not know what to do or what even was wrong. I *still* don't know what's wrong with her, none of us do. I acted as professionally as possible while I spoke her mother and handed her a prescription for some heavy duty iron deficiency medication. It was the only thing I thought might help. 

""As they were getting up to leave, Josephine locked eyes with me and brought a piece of ice to her mouth. She opened her mouth very slowly, her tongue lolling and quivering like some grotesque grey slug. She placed the ice on her tongue and shivered with pleasure. I ushered them out of my office, quickly closed the door, and vomited into my waste bin.""

Dr. Somers stopped talking for a moment and looked like he had just realized something very important. He turned and looked at me.

""I could have had her admitted that day, but I wanted to see if the medication helped her at all in her own environment. I *should* have admitted her that day. I wish I had. Oh God, I wish I had."" He buzzed us through a door with a huge red **X** on it and a menacing red warning: 

**AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. ABSOLUTELY NO ADMITTANCE.**

""Let's sit here for a moment,"" he motioned to two plastic chairs, ""We're almost there, but I have a few more things to tell you before I take you to see her."" 

I just nodded and sat down. I was on information overload at this point and probably quite close to a full blown panic attack. My mind was reeling so I tried to calm myself down while the doctor spoke.

""Two days later, I was paged to the ICU for a psych evaluation. I arrived in the unit and noticed the nurses were pale and seemed agitated. I asked Jenny at the nursing station where I was needed. She pointed down the hallway to room 3B and handed me the patient's chart. I leafed through the chart and stopped dead. It was Josephine. 

""I don't know what I expected to see when I walked into her room, but it certainly wasn't *that*. She was brought in for hypothermia and a possible suicide attempt. It is rare for a doctor to be surprised by something, but when I pulled back her curtain and saw her, I was horrified. 

""She had no lips, all her teeth were exposed, yellow and rotting, which made them look bigger than they had any right being and made her look like she was constantly smiling a horrifying smile. The ends of her fingers were black and already slightly gangrenous. The tip of her right hand ring finger had already broken off. I should have checked her legs and feet, but -- I'm not proud pf this -- I didn't want to and I couldn't bring myself to do it. She was so emaciated I could count her bones beneath her paper thin skin. She had patches of angry red spots where the skin was dry and flaking off on her face, arms, and hands; a consequence of the beginning of hypothermia. 

""While I stood there waiting for my brain to reset so I could speak, she reached up and scratched a red patch until it started to bleed. I think the sight of her injuring herself snapped me back to reality.""

The doctor placed a mask of kind concern on his face and he smiled at Josephine as he sat down on a chair next to her bed.

""Hi, Josephine. I'm Dr. Somers. Do you remember me?"" She looked at him with glassy eyes and nodded as she reached into her bedside drawer and pulled out a half-eaten bag of ice.

""What's going on, Josephine?"" He asked gently. She just stared at him. ""Your chart here says you jumped off a stone outcrop into the lake from 20 feet up. It's the middle of winter. The coast guard and EMTs said that if you had stayed in the water for another ten minutes your hypothermia would have been terminal. You gave us all quite the scare."" He looked up from her chart to find her shoving full handfuls of ice into her mouth, her eyes glazed over with pleasure. He wasn't even sure she heard him or not.

""Josephine,"" the doctor said with a forceful voice, and did not speak again until she slowed her ice gorge and looked at him once more. ""You really scared a lot of people; you have so many people who love you. We just want to help you: you have your whole life ahead of you and a son who needs his mother. I need you to answer me honestly, Josephine: are you suicidal? Is that what happened at the lake? Were you trying to kill yourself?""

She opened her lipless mouth to answer and the doctor saw that the sides of her mouth and a good portion of her tongue were black and covered in sickly green boils. The smell, simply from opening her mouth, was so rancid Dr. Somers' stomach heaved. He realized that was why she wasn't speaking. Most of her mouth was dead and rotting from severe hypothermia. He handed her a note pad and a pen and she immediately wrote *No*. 

""No? You weren't trying to commit suicide? Then what happened? Why would you do this?""

Suddenly and without warning, Josephine vomited forth a massive amount of ice onto her bed. She looked at the doctor, eyes wide with wonder and excitement, like a kid with free range of a candy shop. To his absolute disgust, she started shoveling the regurgitated ice back into her mouth.

""Just tell me why you jumped into a freezing lake in the middle of winter,"" the doctor said, hoping his frustration was in check.

She grabbed the note book and pen and scrawled:

**ICE!** ***BIG*** **ICE! :) &lt;3**

That was when a nurse came in and whisked her off for X-rays and surgery.

""She did all that for ice?"" I asked, searching the doctor's eyes for something, *anything,* that would allow me to hold out hope. There was nothing there. ""I...I don't understand. She's my friend, Doctor. She's my *person.""* I wept. 

""Mental illness is rarely easy to understand. Are you sure you want to continue?""

I nodded. Of course I didn't *want* to continue. I *had* to. My poor, sweet, *beautiful* Josephine. How could I have not been there for her? How could I have let so much time lapse between us? I should have walked through hell itself to remain in contact with her. Guilt is a hard and cruel taskmaster.

""I waited in the ICU for Josephine to be returned to her room,"" Dr. Somers continued. ""Six hours later she was wheeled back in and I immediately went to find the surgeon who had worked on her. I located him in his office making notes. Before I could knock, he spots me and ushers me in, closing the door behind us. He told me he was just about to page me for a Psych Eval on a Josephine \[REDACTED\] who presented with severe hypothermia. He told me she *had* to be suicidal because 'No one gets the way she was by accident unless you were on the Titanic or were windsurfing in a snowstorm'. 

""I assured him I had already been briefed on her situation and was looking into it. I asked him how the surgery went. He told me, 'Medically? Just fine. Personally, though? A nightmare. We had to remove more of her lips -- all the way from above her nostrils to just below her chin. We had to take out about half her tongue and I scraped the gangrenous lesions from the sides, top, and gums of her mouth. How did the *inside* of her mouth get so hypothermic? I also removed the epidermis and dermis of the skin in her mouth hoping that would stop infection and give the poor girl a chance of re-growing healthy tissue in her mouth. I put her on some strong antibiotics to give her body a head start at fighting off the sepsis that was bound to appear. Amputation was required on both hands, above the wrist, both feet, and the legs, directly above the knees. She had frostbite patches almost everywhere on her body. Most will heal by themselves with some topical ointment I prescribed, but we found a few that were infected. We removed those lesions, cleaned 'em out, and were well on our way suturing her up.'

""Sounds pretty standard to me. I started to say that, but he wasn't finished. '*That* wasn't the nightmare part. We were almost through when radiology scrubbed in and ran directly into my OR. Didn't even say anything. Just rushed to the wall where we put X-rays, turned the wall light on, and slid four or five slides onto the wall, his hand shaking so bad he almost dropped one. Me and the team stop what we're doing and go over to view the slides. There was one for her esophagus, her stomach, kidneys, liver, and upper gastrointestinal tract. Want to know what we saw?' 

""No, I told him honestly. He shook his head at me and said, 'Me neither, brother. Me neither.' I'll never forget his face when the surgeon said that. I still see it to this day every time I look at Josephine.""

I was still weeping, I didn't want to hear any more. ""Please. Please just stop. Can we please just go see my friend. I don't want to know what the surgeon saw, or what you saw, or what anyone else in this damn hospital saw. I just want you to take me to see my friend.""

""Elspeth,"" he said gently and placed a fatherly hand on my shoulder, ""if you can't handle hearing it, you certainly can't handle seeing it."" I didn't look up, but I could feel his eyes still on me, searching me.  After a while, he took a deep breath and continued.

""The surgeon told me that the X-rays showed massive internal damage. So massive, in fact, that we had no idea how she was still alive. There were lesions, dead tissue, and perforations in her esophagus, stomach, and large intestine, especially where it attached to her abdominal wall. One of her kidneys had failed, and the second one was only operating at a meagre 36%. Her liver was swollen and dying. In layman's terms, she had more hypothermic trauma *inside* her body than she did *outside*.""

""How is that even possible?"" I asked weakly.

""You know how."" Dr. Somers said. And I *did* know. And I wish I *didn't* know.

""Ice. The near constant consumption of massive amounts of ice."" I said in a whisper. I wanted to throw up. He didn't even acknowledge my answer. He just went right on talking again.

""The surgeon fixed up her insides as best he could; he removed part of her gastrointestinal tract, and as much as the dead tissue he could get his hands on; he amputated a fraction of her stomach that was beyond repair, closed the perforations he was able to, and sewed her back up. He thought she had about about a month to live, give or take. And that was *including* using every single medical treatment that was available to her. To everybody's complete and utter shock, her body did an about face. When she was stable enough, I brought her to Psych and took over her care from then on.

""I need you to trust me when I tell you we tried and tested for everything. *Every*thing. She doesn't have OCD, ADD, ADHD, childhood trauma, history of illegal drug usage, any level of autism, PTSD, any level of depressive disorder, any level of anxiety...you name it, we tested for it. She also didn't respond to any of the therapeutic measures we tried on her. On paper she is a perfectly mentally stable and sane young woman. I always tell my residents that exploration of the brain is the final frontier of medicine, the last unexplored field. If Josephine is mentally ill -- which I think we can both agree is the case -- it is the result of an avenue of the mind that has yet to be found. There's something there, we just haven't discovered it yet. And it's *that* thought that keeps me up at night.""

""Why?"" I asked. *This is the 21st century,* I wanted to scream at him. *Someone will find something soon. Maybe they already have! Just* fix *her. JUST FIX HER!*

""There are many terrifying diseases and conditions out there. AIDS, cancer, Alzheimer's, Schizophrenia, foreign parasites that will literally eat the flesh off your bones. But we *know* about those, what treatments will work, what medication to give, we can even accurately tell a patient and his family how much time he has left to live. But Josephine...she's a mystery, a blank canvas waiting to be filled with treatments that can help her. We don't know if she has a gene mutation or if she's contagious. We don't know if something in the deep, untraversed recesses of her brain was injured somehow. We don't know if it's something genetic, or something domestic, or something foreign. Is it just some form of severe pica that has never been observed until now or is pica only a symptom of something bigger hiding behind it? Is this even a mental health issue at all? Or is it bacterial, or viral, or nature V nurture? We don't know *anything* and *that* is terrifying.

""Come,"" he said and held out his hand, ""We'll go see your friend now. I must warn you, she has destroyed her body in horrific ways.""

I glared at him, ""Thank you, doctor. Your twelve day description of how ruined Josephine is wasn't quite clear enough."" I was angry. Angry that my precious friend had been in here for so long and endured so much. I wanted to rattle his chain a little. I wanted him to be angry too, like me. But he didn't even respond, just kept walking down the hall.

The rooms all faced the hall and had large, floor-to-ceiling bullet and shatter proof glass doors as their only entrance or exit. That way, the doctors could view  them, even speak to them, well out of harms way. Walking down that hallway, I saw things that would give the Devil himself nightmares. But the worst one of all was Josephine.

""Would you like to have a few minutes alone?"" the doctor asked. I shook my head violently.

""No. Don't leave me here."" I said, weeping again.

""Of course."" He stepped to the side and I made my way up to the glass. The room had nothing in it except a toilet bolted to the floor in a far corner. I cast the doctor a disgusted look.

""Please don't misunderstand. The patients are very well taken care of. The glass is for our safety as well as their own. Tables and chairs are wheeled in for every mealtime, and their beds are returned to them upon lights out. If we left those items in there with them all the time they would prove a health and safety risk to the patients who would think to break them down or use components to self-harm. I know it looks sparse and prison-like, and I don't like it as much as you, but it's for their own good. Think of it this way, you wouldn't lay your infant down to sleep on his stomach or with plush toys just because he liked it better that way. You'd lay him on his back in an empty crib and even if he had a fussy night, you would be eternally grateful every morning that he did, indeed, wake up. SIDS is real. SIDS prevention is real, too. That's what we're doing here.""

I wanted to be mad at him, but he made perfect sense. At the end of the day he was just doing his job to the best of his abilities with the resources he had access too. I really wanted to be mad at him because sometimes, a lot of the time actually, being mad is easier than being sad. But I respected him a lot in that moment. He came to work everyday and dealt kindly with these people who other people would spit on in the streets. 

""I apologize for my rudeness. You didn't deserve that. I'm just...SO overwhelmed and angry and sad and I clearly do not know how to deal with all those emotions at once."" I laughed a little at my ignorance and smiled at him. He smiled back.

""Think nothing of it, Elspeth. One never knows how they will react to a situation they've never been in. Especially if that situation involves someone they love."" Damn, if nothing else, the man was wise. I took a deep breath and willed myself to calm, no matter what I saw. I turned back around to face the glass.

In the far righthand corner of the room, opposite the toilet, a child size figure was hunched, rocking back and forth, back and forth, her head hitting the wall every time she rocked forth. Her old hair that looked like the sunrise was gone, replaced by stringy, greasy, piss yellow strands that fell around her like some unholy veil. A sob escaped my throat and the thing that was Josephine jerked her head around with such speed and to such a degree that her neck should have broken. Her black eyes like two dangerous pools of oil saw me and I stepped back.

She turned around in an instant and I saw what was left of my friend. I put my hands to my mouth in shock while tears spilled out of me like a brackish deluge. When I say she was skin and bones, I mean that literally. I don't say this lightly or with any disrespect, but she looked like a Holocaust victim. 

""We've tried a feeding tube,"" the doctor explained softly behind me, ""but she just pulls it out. Now we heavily sedate her for two hours each day in order to pump some nutrients into her. We also had a plastic surgeon come in to repair her lips, but as soon as she was out of surgery she pulled those off as well, mangling her mouth even further. I should also tell you, when we refused to give her anymore ice -- if she ate any more she could die -- she screamed day and night until her jaw broke, her vocal cords ruptured, and her voice box burst. She will never speak again, unfortunately.""

I was facing the doctor while he spoke and when I turned back around, the face I see in my nightmare's every night was *right there*, millimeters away from the glass. Her face was grey and skeletal and horrifying. Where her lips should have been, there was now only a mess of brown teeth, and the glistening, grotesque whiteness of bone from the bottoms of her cheekbones and her chin. Her mouth was open to an inhuman width, her broken jaw quivering and swinging unanchored as she gnashed her teeth. Her oily black eyes were fixed on my own and, through them, I could almost see the old Josephine, the Josephine she should have grown to be.

I screamed and screamed. And again I screamed. The thing ran around the room on all fours, like an animal; her stumps raw and bleeding. And when she returned to where I was, her maw an open abyss of terror, her arm stumps pounding against the glass leaving smears of blood, I screamed once more and passed out.

&amp;#x200B;

I never saw Josephine again. She died shortly after my visit, her mother following her into death courtesy of a piece of nylon around her neck, secured to a high rack in her garage. The double funerals were devastating. I know this isn't an easy read, and to those who made it this far, thank you. Thank you for helping me deal with my trauma. Your support has been invaluable so I will end this post on a high note.

I adopted Max whom Bea had been caring for. My boyfriend and I got married. He is the best father Max could ever have dreamed. We took a trip with Max to Disney for our honeymoon. It was fantastic. Max is just the sweetest little boy. We rode all the rides, visited all the attractions, and on our last day let Max pick any treat he wanted for the ride home. Do you know how much amazing food there is in that park?! I laughed because out of all of that, Max picked a lousy snow cone. We all got one because it was Max's idea. I don't know how much Disney magic they put into snow cones, but it had to have been a lot because it was SO good. I can taste it even now as I write this. You have no idea, you guys.
