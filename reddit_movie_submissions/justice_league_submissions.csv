Why are DC movies so dark? (I mean literally in terms of lighting..),"Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy had bright light. Man Of Steel had bright lights aswell. Batman vs Superman, although I got mixed feelings with it, almost every scene was just dark with barely any lighting. Same thing with Suicide Squad. It just made watching them so visually boring, espiacally since the comics always had great visuals. The Wonder Woman trailer seemed to be bright and colorful on the island, but once they show Diana enter London, the dark and gloomy look is back. And now this new Justice League trailer that just came out seems to be so dark again. Why dont they just raise the brightness in these movies, have some light show some sun?",movies,404,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/61gso5/why_are_dc_movies_so_dark_i_mean_literally_in/,Quick Question,DarkLights95,61gso5,/r/movies/comments/61gso5/why_are_dc_movies_so_dark_i_mean_literally_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/61gso5/why_are_dc_movies_so_dark_i_mean_literally_in/,445,2017-03-25

The OFFICIAL /r/mkebucks Meme Directory,"**/r/MKEBucks Meme Directory**

Please let me know if I've missed anything.

----

**Bucks in Six**

Made popular by Brandon Jennings' (incorrect) declaration that the Bucks would win their first round [series against the Miami Heat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_4uQ52LDwE)

----

**We are the best team in the NBA**

A statement of fact regarding the Milwaukee Bucks standing as the premiere team in the National Basketball Association. Originally the catchphrase of [/u/tacoguy1234](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2o7l74/game_thread_dallas_mavericks_145_milwaukee_bucks/cmkhzk6/) in game threads and post game threads in /r/NBA.

----

**Deer Noise**

The battle cry of the Milwaukee Bucks and their fans. Sometimes stylized as REEEEEEE. [Example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ng1ti0kOoA) 

----

**Fuck Mike Dunleavy**

Mike Dunleavy Jr. is a fuck. Let’s get that out of the way. He has a reputation as a dirty player and in 2015 he showcased that reputation to the world. While playing for the Bulls, [Dunleavy clotheslined Michael Carter-Williams and fucked with a number of Bucks players.](http://www.si.com/nba/2015/05/01/bulls-bucks-mike-dunleavy-jr-giannis-antetokounmpo-nba-playoffs) Because the game was out of hand and the Bucks were going to be sent packing from the playoffs, then string bean and future folk hero Giannis Antetokounmpo barreled into Dunleavy at the other end of the court. Since then, Bucks fans have all united in their shared hatred of Dunleavy. Some fans had a distaste for him before due to a lack of perceived effort during Dunleavy’s tenure as a Buck. Coincidentally, Mike Dunleavy Sr. is a former head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks.

----

**Johnny O’Bryant III**

Former Milwaukee Buck and current Charlotte Hornets big man Johnny O’Bryant has a big following on our sub. He is beloved (by most) and lovingly referred to as the GOAT(Greatest of all time, grandpa). He’s a versatile big man with a silky mid-range and decent rebounding skills. Some people say he’s just a high energy player who will be out of the league in a few years. Those people are wrong. The offensive dynamo even once went 100% from three point range for an entire season, cementing Johnny’s legacy as the greatest player in Bucks history (suck it Kareem). His two biggest supporters are /u/GeauxBucks34 and /u/KungFuCoffin. He has his own subreddit, /r/OneTrueJOB with a number of world-class flair depicting JOB doing a number of various jobs. He also has [a killer highlight reel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqoF1PXlvec&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be)

----

**Gaem Dey**

The pre-game hype threads posted before each Bucks game. Inspired by the Giannis’ pronunciation in this [Milwaukee Bucks commercial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiOhPbogcY.) Original Gaem Dey thread posted by /u/33hov. The thread is gradually becoming cannibalized into an unrecognizable meme that we can no longer control. The spelling changes, sometimes it’s upside down, sometimes it’s in Greek and sometimes it’s a type of dog. It has a mind of its own.

----

**Ban Cookster**

Resident shitposter, and strangely 2016 Most Valuable Poster, /u/cookster123 is one of the power users on the sub. During a 2016 game thread, /u/nelly_24 (then /u/antetokounmpo) made the promise that if a game thread got less than 100 comments, Cookster would be permanently banned from the subreddit. An all-out war for Cooky’s soul began in the comments, with Cookster barely surviving. That was the beginning of the wild game thread comment challenges we all love. Now, any misfortune that befalls the subreddit is blamed on Cookster by default. He is truly an agent of chaos.

----

**Ol’ Flat Ass**

A nickname created by /u/GeauxBucks34 to describe John Henson. Henson’s slender build often allows him to be pushed around by more girthy players. Following a challenge to reach a certain amount of comments on a game thread, /u/GeauxBucks34 was forced to write an erotic poem about John Henson. It’s entitled *50 Shades of Flat Ass.* [It is not a poem.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/5s4gic/50_shades_of_flat_ass/)


----

**""WE ARE GOING TO SHUT THESE BITCHES OUT""**

/u/GeauxBucks34's catchphrase. The source of all our wins and the cause of all of our losses. One of these days, he's gonna be right.

----

**The Username Saga**

The subreddit’s most famous troll. Username was a liar and a creep. He constantly would bait other users into arguing about politics and other societal issues that were both off-topic and completely bat-shit stupid. He holds the record for the most alt accounts banned by /r/mkebucks mods, with at least 20 on record. /u/zmichalo was arguably most dedicated to bringing username to justice. But ultimately what brought him down was his strange behavior towards the moderating team and his misrepresentation of our subreddit across the website as a whole. He had 51 pillars or some shit and accused Jabari Parker of being a cuck involved in match fixing. For a glimpse of what the sub looked like during this shit fest, see /u/swapmeetpete’s [brief summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/4uup8y/how_it_feels_surfing_rmkebucks/)

----

**Cherry Picked Stats**

/u/swapmeetpete’s recurring segment that proves unequivocally that the Bucks are the best team in the NBA. So popular it was [ripped off by some nerd.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/560lna/dude_stole_my_cherrypicked_stat/) /u/roboparents has also been a cherry picker, but Pete posts them most frequently.

----

**/r/Bucks**

The official subreddit for Bucks County, Pennsylvania. What else would it be? This sub is a complete wasteland with no posts. The majority of posts there are from confused basketball fans. I once asked if the owner would be willing to hand over the subreddit. He declined. The sub was flooded by shitposts (mainly from cookster) about how no one had even ever heard of Bucks County, Pennsylvania. That sub has since gone private.

----

**Parsley**

The darkest era of the sub. As part of the wonderful /u/Niehaus’s monthly project of showcasing the most often used words in the subreddit, /u/AlekRivard suggested using a random word often enough to have it show up in the following month’s word cloud. That word was parsley. The stupid movement gradually gained momentum with both /u/shartney and /u/cookster123 joining the fight to spam the word in any and all posts. In a hilarious turn of events, /u/Niehaus’s program filtered out ‘parsley’ as spam and it didn’t make the word cloud for that month.

----

**Brook Lopez**

Scratch that last bit. This is the darkest period of our meming. During trade season and the 2017 All Star Break, multiple posts were made with different variations of how to spell Brook Lopez. Seriously. Rightfully, a lot of users drew the line here. We don’t discuss this period.

----

**Jethro/Saric**

Our resident Australian shithead/the sub’s little brother /u/JethroBarnes looks like Dario Saric from the Philadelphia 76ers (minus the cleft lip). Jethro repeatedly posted photos of himself on the sub which has then turned into multiple photoshops of the little cunt on Saric’s 6’10” body. You can regularly see Jethro and his other Australian pals get fucked up during Bucks games early in the morning on SnapChat.

----

**The Death Bus**

During the Milwaukee Bucks December/January/February free fall, where the Bucks went from the 5th seed in the east to looking like the worst team in the league, /u/Dubisttot declared that he would be purchasing a school bus and then driving it off a cliff. Because he’s a swell guy, Dub then offered seats to any and all users who would like to ride to their demise. /u/swapmeetpete then [created a diagram](https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/5pcozj/oc_death_bus/) with a personalized representation for every person that reserved their seat. It was later turned into a flair. Then faded when we won another game. Then returned to its multicolor glory after we lost again. It was recently faded again and (hopefully) will never return.

----

**Plumlee Face**

Back in 2015, some of the Milwaukee Bucks were challenged to [draw their teammates.](http://uproxx.com/dimemag/milwaukee-bucks-drawing-player-portraits/) Then Buck Josh Powell drew Miles Plumlee and [it was hilarious](https://i.imgur.com/iNftFGq.gif). From time-to-time the pencil on paper drawing would resurface on /r/MKEBucks, mostly posted by /u/cookster123 (seeing a theme here?). One day, /u/Bart_Dart asked why Cookster was so obsessed with the photo and said it would never become a meme. Big mistake. Another comment challenge was created, which ultimately led to the largest total number of comments in a game thread in /r/mkebucks history. If the thread got 2000 comments, the image would become a flair. And by golly, the crazy kids did it. Within a week of the flair being made, Plumlee was traded but the meme never died. /u/LarryMccarrensPinky often posts the image whenever he can. /u/JustinSuperstar even went so far as to make a [t-shirt with the image.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/5zou7c/ran_into_a_local_legend_at_tonights_game/) (available for purchase at deernoise.com) It’s the greatest example of a forced meme in the history of the sub. But what an amazing day in the sub’s history.

----

**Assistant Coaches**

Both /u/formershitposter and /u/traphag have flair for assistant coaches. Sean Sweeney for FSP and Joe Prunty for traphag, respectively. Both begged repeatedly for the special flair. We think it's some type of sexual thing. To each their own.

----

**Who gives a SHIT about your Bucks?**

Bucks CopyPasta that [originated in /r/Tinder.](http://imgur.com/gallery/2MLmr) It goes: ""Who gives a Shit about your bucks? Fuck off. If you were that concerned about your shitty team then you woulda brought it up first. Don't try to turn around what I said on me, you aren't near attractive enough to be a fuckin Dick. You messaged me and asked me to hang out remember. You're just stupid &amp; can't take a hint. I mentioned Sat-urday like maybe we could watch the football games together on Saturday. You idiot. Don't ask me to hang and then say no to Saturday. Bitch you should be willing to hang out any time a sexy girl like me says she's ""willing"" to hang out with a guy like you, when I'm wayyy outta your league. And no Friday night doesn't work for me. That's why I suggested watching my LSU Tigers on Saturday....not like people can't watch 2 games on a same day Retard. No thanks bye! 🖕 ;)""

----

**Who is Alyssa?**

[She’s a fake fan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/5nxndm/a_message_to_fake_fan_alyssa/) She once told /u/ChickenOffSky that the Bucks weren’t good and that only immature men watch the NBA. Fast forward three years and she’s sporting a Jabari Parker jersey. What the fuck, Alyssa? 

----

**Who is Andy?**

[Andy was witness to a number of Bucks wins](https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/5zamfa/can_we_please_get_a_collective_fuck_andy/) at his friend /u/pjmcm’s house. One day he had to study or something and the Bucks lost. What the fuck, Andy?

----

**Have we found [/u/just_wait_a_sec’s Ray Allen jersey yet?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MkeBucks/comments/618sbv/to_the_kid_who_stole_may_ray_allen_jersey_in/)**

No. But we will.

Will Any 2017 Movie Top 'Beauty and the Beast' Before 'The Last Jedi'?,BatB has now topped Logan for the #1 movie of the year. A final tally of $1.2 billion appears likely. Now it is safe to assume that Star Wars: The Last Jedi will earn far more than that as the final blockbuster of 2017. But can anything else top it this year?

Discussion: The horse in the Justice League trailer.,"In BVS ultimate edition horses play a roll in representing the people who Superman failed to save. His father's ghost recounted the story of having his ""hero cake"" while the horses were drowning, how he could still hear them screaming. The horse visual was prominent in the opening sequence in Metropolis and when the capital building was destroyed(also the horses pulling his casket). It's interesting to see that Batman, defender of the defenseless is seen riding a horse on his quest to unite the league, and doing so in the name of humanity and Superman's honor.

[Domestic] Predict the top 10 for 2017 pre-summer edition.,"With all the trailers out now (except for Thor), and Beauty and The Beast contending for top 10 all time and not just 2017, has anyone changed their predictions for 2017? 

Here's my list:  

1. Star Wars VIII - 600M
2. Beauty &amp; The Beast - 580m
3. Guardians Of The Galaxy 2 -450M
4. Justice League  - 400M
5. Despicable Me 3 - 380M
6. Spider Man: Home Coming - 380M
7. Thor: Ragnorak - 310M
8. Pirates Of The Caribbean - 280M
9. Fast &amp; Furious 8 - 270M   
10. Dunkirk - 250M  

Honestly, I'm not confident of my list, too male-heavy. As 2013-2016 showed, the family and female audience has been a real force to reckon with... But I just don't see anything for them this year. 

Thinking all the pent up demand might push up a few surprises. Wonder Woman and Coco come to mind, not sure about Cars. But in the mean time, I'm pushing up the more family friendly titles in my list to make up for it.

What are your thoughts. Specifically, I'll like to know what you think family and females will drive up.

THEORY: Flash warning in BvS kinda makes sense now. Potential spoiler...,"The shot of Lois Lane in the new trailer made me think back about BvS. Flash said:""Lois Lane is the key"". What if he came from the future when the event of The Justice League movie did happen; however, Superman was brainwashed by Steppenwolf/Darkseid and the invasion succeeded. Therefore, Flash came back to the past and warned Bruce so that in the new timeline, Lois Lane can make Superman come back to his sense. It will be an integral part in the movie and even though I dislike the idea of Superman being brainwashed right after resurrection, this will connect the plot point from BvS.

RECOMMENDATION:THE Comic to read before watching Justice League this year.,"IF NO ONE ELSE SAYS IT, I WILL, If for any reason, you haven't read the New 52 Justice League Vol. 1 'Origin' yet, I strongly urge you to read it. The Art looks wonderful as does the narrative.
It is in fact one of the few comics in the last 10 years, that had me waiting for the next volume. 
Even if you heard ""New 52 is bad"", or never read one too many comics. You owe it to yourself to read this one. Because The DCEU Justice League movie is heavily based on this comic and that is for sure. Also it is one of those comics which you makes you hooked onto it from the start.
It May or may not be your all-time Favourite, but you will find some appreciation towards it.",DC_Cinematic,12,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61fu39/recommendationthe_comic_to_read_before_watching/,DISCUSSION,Ironman_Sucks,61fu39,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61fu39/recommendationthe_comic_to_read_before_watching/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61fu39/recommendationthe_comic_to_read_before_watching/,13,2017-03-25

Preferred formation of the Justice League?,"What would be your preferred way to ""unite the seven"".
In the movie we'll see Bruce with the help of Diana actively seek out the help of other metahumans to fight a battle they know is coming. 
Whereas in the new 52 they formed in the heat of battle after little to no contact with each other 

So what's your ideal Justice League origin, maybe it was a government initiative, or just a bunch of super friends who started teaming up more often.",DCcomics,10,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/61i9cd/preferred_formation_of_the_justice_league/,,imjustdifferent,61i9cd,/r/DCcomics/comments/61i9cd/preferred_formation_of_the_justice_league/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/61i9cd/preferred_formation_of_the_justice_league/,17,2017-03-25

OBSERVATION: Do you think the choice of trailer music for these Justice League trailers is a deliberate attempt to keep things light?,"The first trailer we got, the song was ""Icky Thump."" Lighthearded, middle-paced, kinda funky. From the album of the same name that Jack White described the concept of as ""about feeling positive about being alive, taking deep breaths and just being really happy."" So I thought ""Oh, okay, that's on purpose, probably. Havin' fun, not being so dour. But the next trailer, we're probably gonna go back to the stirring orchestral arrangements like we usually get.""

&amp;nbsp;

But fast forward to today and it's more lighthearded, middle-paced, kinda funky music. ""Come Together."" A neat way to play up the theme of uniting the League (coming together) while also keeping up this trend of playful funk/blues/whatever they're doing. 

But what I wanna know is, are they gonna keep this up? Because in all honesty, I could do with some classic dramatic scores. And I would hate for DC or WB or Snyder to be so scared of the whole ""BvS was too serious"" backlash that they go full hog and try to out-Whedon Joss Whedon with his cutesy direction. I liked the Hans Zimmery style.",DC_Cinematic,7,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61gzv6/observation_do_you_think_the_choice_of_trailer/,DISCUSSION,Backanalia,61gzv6,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61gzv6/observation_do_you_think_the_choice_of_trailer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61gzv6/observation_do_you_think_the_choice_of_trailer/,13,2017-03-25

I dont think Darkseid War gets talked about enough,"Just re-read it for the 3rd time and it is just one of the most epic ,awesome,crazy,beautifully drawn comics Ive read. Its a shame because when this book came out, Rebirth came out as well and not a lot of people read the last arc of this story. Johns started an epic ride with his Justice League with the origin of the League taking on Darkseid and for years It was building to this story. Always waiting for the day for the League to take him on again. It has an added element to the Anti-Monitor and Darkseid and daughter grail. The story is very well written and told from Wonder woman's view at times (rare to see from Johns) and The art from Fabok and Manupal is some of the most craziest pages you will ever see. I would put this book up there with The Crisis Books and a very important book in DC. I just wish it got talked about more ",DCcomics,103,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/61oka0/i_dont_think_darkseid_war_gets_talked_about_enough/,Other,geeklovemurder,61oka0,/r/DCcomics/comments/61oka0/i_dont_think_darkseid_war_gets_talked_about_enough/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/61oka0/i_dont_think_darkseid_war_gets_talked_about_enough/,47,2017-03-26
"OPINION: you gotta admit, Affleck exceeded expectations as Batman, and Justice League looks like it is gonna be a really great movie!","I was with everybody else (the initial butthurt-angry mob) who all made shitty jokes toward Batfleck, and how we thought he is a disgrace to this iconic character.. and BOY WAS I F** ING WRONG!! Affleck absolutely killed it as Bats, and is the one thing i am absolutely confident of that he will be amazingly-well done in all the upcoming dc cinematic movies.. IDK if he will always be the best actor as Bats forever, but i can definitely say that he exceeded all expectations a majority of us had, and needs to be praised for it!

I am so keen to see him kick some ass in the upcoming justice league movie.. mad props to the costume designers, they bloody killed it!! I don't know what it is, but i am just mesmerised every time i re-watch the justice league trailer that just came out! Everyone's suits (except flashes) looks on point, particularly batman's imho! it looks even better in this movie than BvS.

##Fun Facts
1. The statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square (directly across from the White House) was partially made from British cannons that were taken in the War of 1812. It was also the first equestrian statue made in the U.S.
2. The Washington Monument is (accidentally) two different colors. Funding ran dry halfway through the project, and when construction restarted, the builders used stones from a different source.
3. You can find a top secret FBI interrogation manual at the Library of Congress. The FBI person who wrote it decided to apply for a copyright and by law, copyrighted material must be made available to anyone with a library card who wants to read it at The Library of Congress.
4. The D.C. Metro is the second busiest subway system in the United States.
5. An empty crypt lies beneath the Capitol building—George Washington was supposed to be buried there. As he was buried in Mount Vernon, the crypt lies empty.

/r/NFL Survivor Round 4 strategy,"So the Falcons look to be goners. As a Saints fan, this makes me overjoyed. What doesn't bring me joy, however, is the fact that the ELoE has the rest of the league in its palm, exploiting other subs to do their bidding only to willingly strike them down when convenient. I can sense that we will be soon. I don't know how soon, but we have to break away from that unholy alliance as soon as possible.

I know that having a heat blanket is appealing. I know that there will be Patriot fans appealing to our ""Gatebreax"" relationship. It can be hard to turn back on that. But we must soon face the fact that we are not of the ELoE, and that the Patriots will turn on us without a second thought. We must recognize that to win, we have to turn to other allies in this game of survival.

Will you join me? Will you help me bring an end to the Evil League of Evil, and bring victory to the Coalition, and to the Good League of Good? Will you be able to tell your grandkids, that when the Evil League marched against us, that you did not yield in the face of tyranny, but fought with the powers of liberty and justice? Will you stand firm, not moving wherever the League tells you, but fighting Evil with all of your might?

"SPECULATION: Why the League is smiling, what Lois is staring at, and about Flash's lightning from the new trailer.","Important to note this is speculation because there is no way to confirm this but here goes:

After spending the entire, almost the entire, day watching the justice league trailer and the videos related to it, meanwhile also taking in all the posts about the subject I noticed that a lot of people think that [Lois might be looking at superman in the sky](http://imgur.com/fqOMA4a). My theory is that this is a shot from very early on in the movie and it shows her looking very grim until she suddenly gets an inkling that he is behind her, so she turns to look up into the sky only to find out that ""it's a bird"" (Hopefully it's a bird, because of the famous it's a bird, it's a plane...). The shot is of her realizing she was wrong and being slightly disappointed.

On the other hand, [this shot with everyone](http://imgur.com/mjK3QMl) (except the bat.. important detail) looking slightly up at the sky is the league looking at Superman. You may notice that during the shot both Cyborg and Aquaman seem indifferent. Barry on the other hand, is very happy/excited, which makes sense because as you might know Barry is a fan of Superman (he had an image of his logo on one of his billboards... and might've used that as an inspiration for his costume). Wonder woman as can be seen in the link above seems happy herself, but a more glad and hopeful kind of happy. Batman isn't in the shot because well he is the one who brought back the man of steel.

Lastly, this is thanks to the trailer breakdown from Flicks and the City:

Some people seem unhappy about Barry's lightning being so destructive and all over the place. However, it's important to notice that is not the case. He does generate a lot of electricity but it mostly retracts back to his suit or forms a close trail right behind him, which is why when he goes zig zag it seems to be all over the place. The lightning is not destructive due to the suit, the wires in the suit help contain it. In BVS he wasn't wearing the suit, thus the crazy sparks everywhere.

THEORY: IMDb for Justice League lists 3 females as Lex Luthor's Guard,"Hey there, was just looking at IMDb today and checked out the Justice League page.  Pretty far down the page there are 3 different actresses Suan-Li Ong, Tina Balthazar, &amp;  Gem Refoufi.  

So I know IMDb isn't all that reliable with smaller casting before a movie is released, but my own personal tin foil hat thought was could these potentially secretly be the Female Furies sent from Apokolips to guard Lex?

No idea if this has been brought up on here before, but thought I'd share my out there idea

Discussion: The Progression of the DC Extended Universe from Man of Steel to Batman V. Superman to Justice League,"I absolutely love the progression of the DCEU and its ambitious toward working to a more hopeful (if still serious) world. 

* Man of Steel was a pulp sci-fi origin story about first contact with Superman/other worldly beings.

* Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice was a misty fantasy about the fallout of said contact with Superman and the Kryptonians.

* Justice League looks to be a traditional comic book ensemble adventure about what it means to be heroic and accepting Superman (and the League as a whole) as Earth's Champion.",DC_Cinematic,5,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61j3ka/discussion_the_progression_of_the_dc_extended/,DISCUSSION,RAIN_MAKAH,61j3ka,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61j3ka/discussion_the_progression_of_the_dc_extended/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61j3ka/discussion_the_progression_of_the_dc_extended/,1,2017-03-26

The story for injustice 2,"what i think superman's arc will be is the other regime members (cyborg, wonder woman, black adam, maybe robin etc) will go and create a kind of secret justice league or injustice league and they will battle gr odds society (bane, cheetah, deadshot, poison ivy, captain cold) and then the insurgency will join in and it will be this big three way battle which i think may be over supergirl and then supergirl sees Kal-el and just levels the whole battle and some how alerts branic of Earth then of course branic will come. This battle will be in the med story and as the game subtitle suggests 'every battle defines you' i think branic will brain wash a few of each members of the team so he has back up and one of these will be wonder woman or supergirl which will p*ss of superman and thats why superman is willing to help i doubt it will be supergirl as they said they will be heavily focusing on her and she is almost the main character of the story. but towards the end of the story one or two main characters will die battling branic and this makes superman realize that he has been battering the wrong enemy. Then a sudden boom tube will take all the remaining villains to Apocalypse where darkseid will then turn and grin towards them similar to the season 2 finale of young justice setting up injustice 3.

19F4A- The Girl of Steel (Supergirl RP),"I groan as I wake up, hitting my alarm on the side of my dresser. I don’t even know what time it’s set for, what time zone that I’m in. I nevertheless float up, the standard blue blankets of the Justice League Watchtower falling off me as I float higher, before I’m able to stand on the floor. Clark set me up with a nicer room than I thought I’d get, one with a view. It’s not of Earth but it’s still space. I used to be scared of space, having spent so long travelling through it. But I’ve moved past that now, accepted everything that’s happened to me. Embraced it I suppose. As I float over to the window, brushing the loose strands of long blonde hair out of my eyes, I can’t help but find myself in awe of the beauty outside the window, of the endlessness of space and everything it has to offer. I haven’t been out there yet, haven’t struck up the nerve really. Clark says that it’s fine, that the lack of oxygen doesn’t hurt me, but I can’t help but still be worried to do so. 

I’m broken out of my reverie by a knock on my door, to which I descend to the floor and walk over to open. Walking grounds me, both literally and mentally, and I find myself enjoying it, much more than I ever would have thought that I would have. When I open it I find Diana, Wonder Woman, there smiling at me. We’ve developed a close friendship, closer than I have with most other superheroes or superheroines. “Hello Kara,” Diana smiles at me, which I return. I can see her raised eyebrow at my outfit, making me blush a little as I look down at myself. I’m only wearing a pair of small pajama shorts and a big Superman shirt that I bought in Metropolis. “It was on sale,” I say quietly, making Diana let out a small laugh. “Well c’mon. I’ll show you around,” she says and I nod, stepping out and closing the door behind me, following Diana around the Watchtower.

The Watchtower is amazing, me basically speechless as Diana shows me around. It’s my first time up here, even though I’ve met many of the people here, I haven’t been made an ‘official’ member of the Justice League yet. Clark says that I need a couple more months, or maybe a couple more years before I’m ready. As much as I dislike that, I understand that Batman (Clark won’t tell me his name) wants only the most trustworthy in the League. After the tour Diana leaves me in my room, and I sit on the bed. I quickly change into my [costume](http://cdn2-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/supergirl-1x19/107910_d0845b.jpg). With a smile I look out the window one more time, grabbing my small duffel bag of my clothes, and a couple snacks that I may have taken from the kitchen. With a sigh I walk to the door, and close it behind me before I make my way to the teleporter to get back to the Fortress of Solitude.

---------------

So in this roleplay I am Kara Zor-El, also known as Supergirl. Although I have the appearance of Melissa Benoist, this is the Supergirl in the comic book universe, just having her appearance. You can either be an OC or an established DC character, although I would prefer if you were a superhero rather than a villain, although I am open to you being a villain if that is what you prefer. If you plan to be an OC, you can be either another superhero present at the Watchtower at this moment, or rather a normal human being on Earth. The same goes if you plan to be an established character. I would prefer though if your character was not superpowered. This prompt is meant to be long-term and detailed, both with the building of the relationship between our two characters, but also Kara fully coming to grips with being on Earth, as well as the struggles with a relationship between Kara, being one of the most powerful beings on Earth, and someone without powers. This will be a slow burn, with us building not only the world, but the characters as well.

We don't need to go directly off the prompt, since it can be either a starting off point, or just a writing sample if you prefer. If you decide to message, if you could title it *[Your character] and Kara Zor-El* that would be greatly appreciated. Just so I know you read this far and to better organize. 

One character I have been craving with Kara is Lena Luthor, if anybody is willing to and watches the Supergirl show. If you aren't Lena that doesn't mean I won't respond, just I'll likely give priority to someone who is well written and plays Lena. I am open to both male and female characters. I look forward to talking to you guys :) ",dirtypenpals,4,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/61mplu/19f4a_the_girl_of_steel_supergirl_rp/,Long Term RP,katiesarah3,61mplu,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/61mplu/19f4a_the_girl_of_steel_supergirl_rp/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/61mplu/19f4a_the_girl_of_steel_supergirl_rp/,0,2017-03-26

Who are your top favourite different versions of Batman?,"What is your ranking of all the Batman characters? From live action adpations to alternate versions. Here is mine from highest to lowest:

1. **Batman - DCAU:** Kevin Conroy will always be the voice of Batman. This Batman was dark, gritty but always enjoyable to watch. 
2. **Batman - Ben Affleck:** Despite him breaking his rule, this is the best live action Batman I have ever seen. His action scenes, his detective works, him being an extremist, defeating Superman, being a perfect Bruce Wayne and he is the leader of the Justice League. Just what I always wanted. I hope we see him have a relationship with Wonder Woman.
3. **Batman - Arkham Series** Once again, given the remarkable voice performance from the legendary Kevin Conroy. This Batman fights so well and is just so much fun. 
4. **Batman - Thomas Wayne:** What happens when Batman becomes the Punisher? He becomes awesome!!! I really loved that this version of Batman became an extremist against crime with his own wife being the Joker. This Batman isn't afraid to cross the line. When Bruce knocks the enemy down, they get back up. When Thomas knocks the enemy down, they stay down. 
5. **Batman - Dark Claw:** Batman is my favourite DC character, Wolverine is my favourite Marvel character. When these two became one character, I loved this character so much! 
6. **Batman - The New 52:** I really loved his storylines, while still being a dark and gritty Batman. 
7. **Batman - The Batman:** From the amazing animated series, the Batman, he deals with even more terrifying villains. However, I am not much of a fan of his design.
8. **Batman - Michael Keaton:** He does a great job being the first dark version of the Batman, just not much of a skilled fighter.
9. **Batman - Gotham:** I love that we get a look at Bruce Wayne slowly growing into Batman. 
10. **Batman - TDK Trilogy:** He is a great realistic Batman but that's it. I hate the look and the infamous growling voice.

DISCUSSION: Are the CGI complaints valid?,"I have been seeing a lot of people online complaining about the CGI in the Justice League trailer (and really other movie trailers). For one it doesn't make sense why it's even a complaint or seen as a valid one for that. It's is like asking the chef for a an early taste of the food he is making you, then complaining that the food is undercooked. Like, what do people expect. I feel people are so whiney these days, studios are better off holding off releasing trailers until all CGI work is done.",DC_Cinematic,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61ovd6/discussion_are_the_cgi_complaints_valid/,DISCUSSION,DivinePear,61ovd6,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61ovd6/discussion_are_the_cgi_complaints_valid/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61ovd6/discussion_are_the_cgi_complaints_valid/,39,2017-03-26
When do the events of Justice League where Jessica Cruz becomes a Green Lantern Take Place?,"Odd question and i'm sure the answer is it doesn't but its forced in there.  When do the events of Jessica Cruz with the Justice League becoming a Green Lantern take place?  She mentions that Simon Baz was a green lantern longer than her.  Yet the time period when it most likely happend the Green Lanterns were all missing and Hal Jordan had a gauntlet not a ring.  Is there any rational way the Justice League Jessica Cruz continuity and the Green Lanterns Continuity can mesh properly?  Jessica Cruz did not vanish when all the green lanterns Vanished so she must have become a green lantern AFTER those events, yet given Hal Jordan and the Justice League during those moments it doesn't really mesh up.  Does it work?",dc_comics,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dc_comics/comments/61iwkr/when_do_the_events_of_justice_league_where/,,TimelordAcademy,61iwkr,/r/dc_comics/comments/61iwkr/when_do_the_events_of_justice_league_where/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dc_comics/comments/61iwkr/when_do_the_events_of_justice_league_where/,8,2017-03-26

Re-watching Civil War on Netflix,"It's been almost a year since I've seen this movie (3 times in Cinema)...And as a person who thought this movie looked like something on TV, I'm eating my words right now. 

This movie looks a lot better than i remember it. 

This airport scene is still glorious. 

Also, after watching that Justice League trailer. I'm just going to ride this high of comic book movies and have fun with it all.

"Weekly Discussion Thread: Comics, TV and More! [March 27, 2017]","Hey there honorary Justice League members - it’s a new week which means it’s time for a new discussion thread!

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Green Lantern* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Green Lantern"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Anyone caught posting unwarranted top level comments will be flaired and publicly shamed.  

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Christopher Priest has been doing a great job with *Deathstork*, and I'm excited to see him write an encounter against Duck Grayson and Batmallard!""

* If you'd like to make a comment about the weekly thread itself or provide feedback, please reply to the [**Weekly Meta Discussions Thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/61s7uk/weekly_discussion_thread_comics_tv_and_more_march/dfgthkj/).

"Discussion: Maybe I'm really optimistic, or I just really love Superman, but I feel like his return in JL is gonna help audiences like him more","I love Superman. Loved MOS. Didn't care for him dying in BVS, but understood why they did it, even if it wasn't the best thing they could've done. But I feel like his return in JL is gonna resemble the Flight scene in MOS. When I look at the DCEU, Superman is really the central piece around it. His Black Zero event brought out Batman, and his death brought about the Justice League. He's inspired people from the comics, and he's doing the same in the movies, no matter how skewed that path may seem.

Also, I hope he doesn't come back evil. It defeats the entire point of his character to me. He was on this journey to self discovery and people hated him at the same time. It'd be nice to just see him come back with this new outlook on life and mirror the Superman we all know and love from the comics. Plus, it'd set him up for MOS2, and maybe people will turn around to like him more.",DC_Cinematic,30,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61rtws/discussion_maybe_im_really_optimistic_or_i_just/,DISCUSSION,yoshiyahu17,61rtws,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61rtws/discussion_maybe_im_really_optimistic_or_i_just/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61rtws/discussion_maybe_im_really_optimistic_or_i_just/,6,2017-03-27

Create your own Justice League,"In an alternate universe, the classic members of the Justice League has been defeated and killed. The trinity - Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman - along with Cyborg, Hal Jordan, Barry Allen and Aquaman have been killed. It's up to you to assemble your own team of superheroes to create the new Justice League. Remember, you need to have a leader, a powerful one and a co-leader. And don't forget, you can't choose from the former founding members I have just mentioned. You have to choose seven characters. Here is mine:

- **Nightwing:** Nightwing would be the leader of this Justice League. He was trained by Batman and would be very tactical. He could be a great leader for this Justice League and lead this team to victories. He is also very good at outsmarting his enemies, but also has fun being a vigilante. 
- **Doctor Fate:** Doctor Fate would be the powerful one. He is the sorcerer supreme so he could be the one to deal with the much stronger threats. Plus, he is very highly skilled in magic, sorcery and the mystic arts, which could help deal with major threats like supernatural and mystical threats.
- **Shazam:** Shazam would be the heart and soul of the team. He is powerful, but would also always bring light to this Justice League. He is strong, fast, wise and has the power of Zeus. 
- **GL John Stewart:** An intergalactic cop would be a great addition to the team. He would help with evacuations and also dealing with major threats. He would be the co-leader of the team. He was a soldier so he would understand how to take orders, so whenever Nightwing is not there to lead, GL will be.
- **Mera:** She is a very capable fighter and is very skilled at combat. She can manipulate water and turn it into weapons. She would be a great addition to the team. She could also help the team with aquatic threats. 
- **Flash Wally West:** He is also the heart and soul of the team. A speedster would be great to have on the team. He could help evacuate civilians. He could also bring light to the team.
- **Green Arrow:** With a marksman, victory would be much easier. I mean, Green Arrow could even shoot an arrow with one arm. He is a true marksman. He could help the team take out enemies from long distances.

Fellow Furry needs help.,"Hello. I'm a furry. I'm not very active in this community, but god damn you guys are great. Now, I have a small request.

See, as probably very few of you may know, there is a certain thing going on right now in /r/NFL and we need the furries help fighting evil.

Yes fighting Evil. Let me give some backstory for you.

In the NFL, there are 32 teams. I won't list them as this post is going to be long enough but there are 32.

These teams have been split by the fans into five groups.
The Ungulate Teams: Teams with hooves on their mascots. (Also dolphins because reasons.)

The Bird Teams: The birb teams.

The Cat Teams: Stuff like Bengals, Lions, Big cats c'mon this is obvious.

The GLOG: aka the Good League of Good. These guys are uh... underdogs? No one really knows.

The ELOE: The evil league of Evil. These guys are important.

Now, the thing about the ELOE is that, everyone hates them. Everyone. They win everything and gloat about too. Their like that jock in school. Who plays football. In fact they *were* that jock in school now that I think about it...

So, it's the offseason for football fans, the games have stopped and everything is boring. Until one fateful day, /u/KanyesRealFriend started a poll. He made a thing like survivor, where everyday you vote for the team you want to get rid of, until three teams are left and then there would be one last poll to decide the winner.

The ELOE have taken over the poll. They used their evil manipulation and stupidly large fanbases to completely ruin everything. They have already taken out almost all of the bird teams, and are now looking to attack the Ungulates. Soon, they will turn to the GLOG and cat teams, and then Evil will have prevailed.

Many teams from the other groups have joined together to create the coalition against evil, but it hasn't been enough. These smaller teams don't have enough umf to out-vote the evil-doers.

This is where you come in, my furry friends.

Please, join the cause. Help out a furry brother in fighting evil. Please, all the Coalition needs is a little push to take out the ELOE's leader. Vote for the Patriots, vote for justice.

Let this be the day the Furries made a stand against the mean school jock who always bullied them in school. Let it be the day the Furries and the furry teams defeated evil.

Let it be the greatest joint community meme in existence.

I hope to see you all on the battlefield, fighting for good.

(Also, sorry if this post isn't okay mods. Just delete it and message me to go away if this is not allowed, and I will apologize. We're just very desperate for some help because things are looking bleak for the small guys, and I thought it would be funny and awesome if the animal teams teamed up with you all, you know?)


TL;DR, /r/NFL is locked in a grueling war and the little teams need help. Please click this link and vote for the Patriots (It's actually a vote against them.)

"Discussion: What are the actual realistic chances that Cyborg actually says ""booyah"" in Snyder's Justice League?","Seriously think about this. I know everybody is saying ""Cyborg better say it booyah. He better say it. He's not Cyborg if he doesn't say it"" and really that's an important thing for many of this fans because we all grew up with the cartoon. I get that but at the end of the day it's one cartoon albeit a popular one but I don't think that's kind of Snyder's MO. The gritty ""realistic"", introspective, badass exploration of these characters. I know it seems synonymous with the character where it's almost unthinkable but that's kind of exclusive to the cartoon. What are the actual chances that Cyborg actually says ""Booyah"" in the movie? What are the chances that Zack actually references the teen titans tv show? How much money would you bet on it? Realistically. What are the chances?",DC_Cinematic,16,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61pk51/discussion_what_are_the_actual_realistic_chances/,,vote4ian,61pk51,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61pk51/discussion_what_are_the_actual_realistic_chances/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61pk51/discussion_what_are_the_actual_realistic_chances/,25,2017-03-27
"I miss important henchmen/women for our main villans, and how that impacts the series as a whole.","Remember Zarbon, Dodoria, the Ginyu force and if you wanna go back, the entire Red ribbon saga?. Yeah, i miss guys like that. Ever since the Cell saga we mostly been getting 1 main villan with the usual throwaway goon that dies in 2 even 1 episode. Henchmen are really important in a series like dragon ball for me. At the end, we all know Goku is gonna be the strongest and beat up the main bad guy, but having henchmen, (THAT ACTUALLY HAVE PLOT IMPORTANCE AND CHARACTER) gives lesser characters stuff to do, as well as giving more menance to the main big bad. 

Its alright to have characters to be much weaker than others, just look at the DC universe, Superman is pretty much god but other justice league characters still have stuff to do and other baddies to beat.

The problem we have with Dragon ball is not that characters are weak, its because they are USELESS. 

This new universal survivor arc has the right idea, not every character on this battle royale is gonna be a Op god that only Goku/Vegeta can beat. So please i ask, make these less powerful characters more important, give them character, and make our lesser powerful characters fight them and give them a little rivalry.

"Discussion: For educational purposes, a video over what a cinematographer does and one w/ JL cinematographer Fabian Wagner.","https://youtu.be/7s5VyLPbO_Q
A Collider panel quickly discusses the relationship between Director and Cinematographer and what exactly the director of photography does.

https://youtu.be/BktkiZSp2Wo
Fabian Wagner discusses some of his work on an episode of Game of Thrones (see also the Battle of the Bastards episode). 
----------------


I like to look into this stuff to get a feel for what we may be in store for with Justice League. Obviously there's a lot going into what comes out in the final product. Directors are still the guy in charge on set telling the cinematographer what he wants, but new cinematographers bring in new voices and ideas. That's an exciting prospect regardless of the fact that I thought Larry Fong did great work ok BvS.
We may go from almost docu-style in Man of Steel, to stylized and somewhat otherworldly in BvS to something in the middle with JL. Who knows. 
I will say I thought the Doomsday fight got a little muddled from a filmmaking perspective and I'm interested to see a potentially different take on fights with CGI characters this November.",DC_Cinematic,12,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61reud/discussion_for_educational_purposes_a_video_over/,DISCUSSION,TvsPhil,61reud,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61reud/discussion_for_educational_purposes_a_video_over/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61reud/discussion_for_educational_purposes_a_video_over/,6,2017-03-27

How do trailer editors add extra beats and drums to songs?,"For example, the Justice League trailer which was released this past Saturday, uses the song Come Together by Godsmack. However, it's been enhanced somehow. I see this a lot, mostly when movie trailers have real songs as the music.

The Chain by Fleetwood Mac, for example, was used in one of the recent Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 trailers.

Comparing the original song and the trailer version, there is definitely a difference. The trailer songs always feel like they have more ""umph"" and extra drum beats and such, and I was just curious as to how they do this.",VideoEditing,11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/61uals/how_do_trailer_editors_add_extra_beats_and_drums/,,ultrasargent,61uals,/r/VideoEditing/comments/61uals/how_do_trailer_editors_add_extra_beats_and_drums/,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/61uals/how_do_trailer_editors_add_extra_beats_and_drums/,9,2017-03-27

A hopeful theory that Superman is in Justice League and NOT the enemy (for long at least),"So in the Justice League trailer, the camera flashes and pans across our four current known members, Cyborg, Flash, WW and Aquaman, in that order.

I believe this is because Superman is between them like so: http://imgur.com/a/pAB07 (excuse the terrible photoshop.)

**REASONING**

*  The shot lingers on Cyborg and Aquaman longer than The Flash and WW as they are either side of him, any more and he'd be in the shot.
* The frame is nearly face on Cyborg and it comes round near Aquamans side at the end, so likely get a shot of them lined up, however the change in angle between The Flash and WW seems just a bit too big for me.

Then I feel the only person Flash could be grinning at is Supes. They wouldnt have been introduced until then probably, so he's excited.

Of course I could be wrong because there's nothing to go on, and for all I know it's just Batman in the middle. I'm just clinging on to hope!

THEORY: Knightmare Sequence Storyline," Superman doesnt appear in the trailer because he will be one of the main villains in the movie. He has back from death but lost his memory and under the control of Darkseid. He attacked the Earth with the parademons. The evil Superman was too powerful for Justice League even Kryptonite proven no use. 

 Right before his death and left only Wonder Woman and Flash fighting with their last breath, Bruce suddenly came out with an idea that Lois Lane might help Superman to recover his memory. Flash ran immediately to get Lois. By the time Lois was there Wonder Woman also died, Darkseid has taken over the Earth. So Flash realised that the only possible way out is to go back in time to inform Bruce that Lois is the key.


**My Opinion:** Even tho its not bad i dont think this is the scenario in the movie. Snyder and Geoff Gohns 100% have a better idea.",DC_Cinematic,6,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61sfdv/theory_knightmare_sequence_storyline/,DISCUSSION,JaylockSB,61sfdv,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61sfdv/theory_knightmare_sequence_storyline/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61sfdv/theory_knightmare_sequence_storyline/,6,2017-03-27
Discussion: Reverse Flash in the DCEU,In the Justice League trailer we see a brief glimpse of Billy Crudup as Henry Allen in prison. This pretty much confirms that Reverse Flash is in the DCEU.

Amnesty international report 2016/17. Algeria discussion thread.,"Hey reddit, WE DID IT. One more subscriber since last time, its working ! Thanks to everyone who reads these, i put a lot of time into them and with the goal that people know a little more about whats going on in the world past the stereotypes and the major major headlines. If you're new here i'm going through every country/territory alphabetically using AI's 16/17 to outline to the current state of the human rights in the region and offering a ~~reasonably~~ educated guess on the ripple effects of the issues and what the future may hold. I'll link the previous posts at the bottom as per usual and without any further shenanigans let kcik things off with....    

#ALGERIA   

**People's democratic republic of Algeria**    
Head of state: **Abdelaziz Bouteflika**    
Head of government: **Abdelmalek Sellal**     

The authorities continued to restrict the
rights to freedom of expression, association,
assembly and religion, and prosecuted
peaceful critics, including human rights
defenders, in unfair trials. Refugees and
migrants were arbitrarily expelled. Impunity
for past serious abuses continued to prevail.
Courts handed down death sentences; no
executions were carried out.    

**BACKGROUND**   

In January, the government dissolved the
Department for Information and Security
(DRS), the main security agency previously
associated with torture and other ill-treatment
of detainees. It was replaced with a Security
Services Directorate that reports directly to
the President.
Also in January, changes to the Code of
Criminal Procedure came into effect,
including new witness protection measures,
limits to the right to appeal in minor offence
cases and amendments allowing suspects to
contact lawyers immediately when they are
taken into police custody. The changes did
not give suspects the right to have their
lawyer present during interrogation.
Constitutional amendments adopted in
February included the creation of a National
Human Rights Council to replace the
National Consultative Commission for
Promotion and Protection of Human Rights.
Other amendments included making
Tamazight a national language, thus
enhancing the cultural rights of the Amazigh
population.^1 The authorities continued to block access
to Algeria by UN human rights mechanisms,
including those with mandates on torture and
other ill-treatment, counter-terrorism,
enforced disappearance and freedoms of
association and peaceful assembly. The
authorities also continued to prevent
international organizations, including
Amnesty International, from conducting
human rights fact-finding visits.   

**FREEDOMS OF ASSOCIATION AND
ASSEMBLY**    

The authorities continued to leave many civil
society associations, including Amnesty
International Algeria, in legal limbo by failing
to acknowledge their registration applications.
Such applications were required under Law
12-06 on associations, which imposed wideranging
arbitrary restrictions on associations
and exposed members of unrecognized
associations to up to six months’
imprisonment and fines.
The authorities tightly restricted freedom of
assembly, maintaining a ban on all
demonstrations in the capital, Algiers, under
a decree from 2001, and arresting and
prosecuting peaceful protesters.
In January a court in Tamanrasset
imposed fines and one-year prison sentences
on seven peaceful protesters convicted of
“unarmed gathering” and “offending public
institutions” for protesting in December 2015
about a local land dispute. Six of the seven
protesters were released in July under a
presidential pardon. The seventh, activist
Dahmane Kerami, remained in prison serving
a one-year sentence in a separate case. He
was convicted of participating in “unarmed
gatherings” and “obstructing traffic” during
peaceful protests in Tamanrasset in 2015
against shale gas fracking and in support of
workers laid off by a local gold mining
company. He was released on 31 December
after serving his sentence.^2
In March, a court sentenced activist
Abdelali Ghellam to one year in prison and a
fine after convicting him of inciting others to
participate in an “unarmed gathering” and
“obstruct traffic”. The charges related to
comments about the protest in Tamanrasset
that he published on Facebook. He was
released in April.      

**FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION**  

The authorities prosecuted peaceful critics
and forced the closure of media outlets.
In March, a court in Tlemcen convicted
and fined Zoulikha Belarbi, a member of the
Algerian League for the Defence of Human
Rights (LADDH), for defamation and for
“offending” the President and a public body.
The charges related to her publishing a
satirical collage on Facebook depicting
President Bouteflika and senior officials. A
six-month prison term was added to her
sentence on appeal in December.
In June, the authorities arrested the
director and the producer of the private
Khabar Broadcasting Corporation and a
Ministry of Communication official in
connection with two popular satirical current
affairs programmes. The three were detained
for several weeks before a court sentenced
them to suspended prison terms of between
six months and one year for licensing
irregularities. Gendarmes sealed the
recording studios in July, forcing both shows
off the air.^3
In July, a court sentenced freelance
journalist Mohamed Tamalt to two years’
imprisonment after convicting him of
“offending” the President and public
institutions in comments he published on
Facebook and in his blog about corruption
and nepotism among leading officials. An
appeal court confirmed his sentence in
August, following a hearing at which he
accused prison guards of beating him. He
began a protest hunger strike at the time of
his arrest in June, became comatose in
August, and died in hospital in December.
The authorities failed to adequately
investigate his alleged beating in detention,
his treatment in prison and his death.^4
In November, a court in El Bayadh
sentenced Hassan Bouras, a journalist and
human rights activist, to one year in prison on
charges of complicity in offending public
officials and a public body after a private
television station broadcast film of him
interviewing three people alleging police and
judicial corruption.^5   

**FREEDOM OF RELIGION AND BELIEF**   

From June onwards, the authorities targeted
members of the Ahmadi Muslim community,
arresting more than 50 in Blida and Skikda
provinces and other parts of the country on
account of their faith, according to media
reports and civil society groups. Soon after
the June arrests in Blida, the Minister of
Religious Affairs publicly accused Ahmadis of
“extremism” and of serving foreign interests.
In November, a court in Skikda sentenced 20
Ahmadis to fines and prison terms ranging
from one month to one year; at the end of the
year they remained at liberty pending appeal.
In August, a court sentenced Christian
convert Slimane Bouhafs from Setif to five
years in prison for “denigrating” Islam and
“insulting” the Prophet Muhammad in
comments he posted on Facebook. An
appeal court reduced the sentence to three
years’ imprisonment.^6    

**HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS**   

The authorities harassed and prosecuted
human rights defenders. In March, a court in
Ghardaia charged lawyer Noureddine
Ahmine with “insulting a public institution”
and falsely reporting an offence, in relation to
a complaint of torture that he had filed,
apparently on behalf of a client, in 2014.
Noureddine Ahmine had defended many
protesters and journalists facing charges
arising from their peaceful exercise of their
human rights.
In June, an investigative judge in Ghardaia
issued an arrest warrant against lawyer Salah
Dabouz, a member of LADDH, in relation to
comments he made about unrest in Ghardaia
and for allegedly taking a computer and
camera into a prison.    

**JUSTICE SYSTEM**   

Dozens of people arrested in connection with
communal violence in 2015 in the Mzab
region remained in pre-trial detention
throughout 2016 as the authorities
investigated them on charges of terrorism
and inciting hatred. They included political
Amnesty International Report 2016/17 65
activist Kameleddine Fekhar and other
supporters of regional autonomy.
In March the UN Human Rights
Committee found that Algeria had violated
Articles 2, 7 and 9 of the ICCPR. Its findings
related to the failure to investigate allegations
by businessman Mejdoub Chani that DRS
officers had detained him incommunicado
and tortured him during interrogation
following his arrest for corruption and money
laundering in 2009. He remained in prison at
the end of the year awaiting the outcome of
appeals to the Supreme Court.   

**WOMEN’S RIGHTS**  

The Family Code continued to discriminate
against women in matters of marriage,
divorce, child custody and guardianship, and
inheritance. Women and girls remained
inadequately protected against gender-based
violence in the absence of a comprehensive
law. The Penal Code continued to prohibit
rape without defining it or explicitly
recognizing marital rape as a crime, and
allowed men who rape girls under the age of
18 to escape trial by marrying their victim.
The Penal Code also continued to criminalize
abortions.    

**REFUGEES’ AND MIGRANTS’ RIGHTS**   

The government again failed to enact
legislation protecting the right to asylum.
Clashes between local residents and
migrants from sub-Saharan Africa occurred
in Bechar and Ouargla in March, in
Tamanrasset in July, and in Algiers in
November.
In December, security forces arrested an
estimated 1,500 sub-Saharan African
migrants and refugees in Algiers, and
arbitrarily expelled hundreds of them to
neighbouring Niger within days. Those not
expelled were released in the southern city of
Tamanrasset and reported being barred from
public transport to prevent them returning to
Algiers.   

**COUNTER-TERROR AND SECURITY**   

Security forces and armed opposition groups
clashed in several areas. The authorities said
the security forces killed 125 alleged
members of armed groups but disclosed few
details, raising concern that some may have
been extrajudicially executed.
In March, the armed group calling itself alQa’ida
in the Islamic Maghreb claimed
responsibility for a rocket attack on a gas
production site in Khrechba. No casualties
were reported.  

**IMPUNITY**   

The government continued to allow impunity
for serious human rights abuses committed
during the 1990s, by failing to investigate
past abuses and hold those responsible to
account. The unlawful killings, enforced
disappearances, rape and other torture
committed by the security forces, as well as
some abuses committed by armed groups,
may amount to crimes against humanity.^7   

**DEATH PENALTY**   

Courts continued to impose death sentences.
No executions have been carried out since
1993.

#END    


Now once again there are good and bad things to take from this. One of the strongest messages which is both good and bad is the death of British-Algerian journalist Mohamed Tamalt. This man was imprisoned for exercising his freedom of speech. He posted a poem on facebook satirically criticising his president only to be sentenced to jail. He went on a three month hunger strike which resulted in a comatose state, from which he later died. This man deserves recognition. Amnesty international urged Algerian authorities to launch and conduct an “independent and transparent investigation into the circumstances” of the journalists death. Something they have still not come good on. I believe that there is good to be found in every situation, and the good that came from Mr. Tamalt's death was the eye opening that people will hopefully get from it. He joins the thousands/millions of people who have died for their cause and put themselves through torturous situations just to get their message across. Well now he's gone and we're here. He did the hard part, all we have to do is help spread his message, live the philosophy and simply make him proud. Share his story with every one you know (and i would say get as many people as possible to share the same poem with the Algerian government but my attribution with AI prohibits me from doxxing, even if that doxxing is Mr. Sellal's oppressive regime).   

When it comes to the refugees and migrants, its the same old story. Not just with Algeria but with pretty much the whole world unfortunately. We (as the human race) are going through a crucial period whereby A LOT of things are changing. History is doomed to repeat itself and i see a scary amount of similarities from pre-WW1/2 coming about again. A huge financial crash and years of turmoil/fallout as the economy tries to stabilise, resulting in housing, job, food, aid/relief and infrastructure crisis. Factor in the UK leaving the EU, TRUMP, Scotland potentially leaving the UK and rejoining the EU, the Arab spring and all that came with it, the Syrian war and we will see history repeat itself. Next is all out world war. We're currently seeing the largest migration of refugees since WW2 and it seems we've learnt nothing.    

Almost 0 countries are taking a good stance on harbouring the poor, war-torn people on need of help. Turning away orphan children and pregnant woman because they see a 'white mans' erection as more important than a 'black mans' life. (In America 2006 the government spent $77.2 Million on 'processing umaccompanied minors seeking asylum' and $84.24 Million on Viagra the same fiscal year).     


It's tragic and Algeria is not exempt, not at all. Leaving the ~1500 immigrants completely stranded in a foriegn country with no help, its disgusting. These people make these pilgrimages to start a better life, who are we to tell a citizen of the world, a fellow member of the human race ""no, you can't come here, you're not welcome"", and then leave them to (often times) die. I suppose what i'm saying with where this will go (the attitude of refugees, worldwide) is to a mass death toll (on top of the casualties already) and eventually a war.   

**The thing that annoys me the most about this is if it was millions of white Europeans in the exact situations, as opposed to the millions of African/Asian/Middle Easterns....there would have been a solution yesterday.**    

Anyway, rant over. All told Algeria is still a major concern in terms of human rights violations and is a terrible example for free speech. But, to my brothers and sisters over there, continue fighting, we are doing everything we can for you in this broken system and we will prevail!   

If anyone would like to look into the work that Amnesty do more in depth, go [here](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/) and be made aware of campaigns such as 'write for rights' and our various petitions etc.... you can also donate if you want to!   

Lastly people, i just wanted to clarify the purpose for these posts....They are for people to educate themselves and if you have any questions as to the country/territory in question (or just about Amnesty/human rights in general) then please feel free to ask! I hope to encourage some debate with these :)

All are welcome to join, ask questions about certain minutes, or comment on what you've been listening to!

[Listen in on our discussion of Minute 46 of Man of Steel here](http://traffic.libsyn.com/dccinematicminute/MoS-E-046.mp3)

Synopsis: Jor-El begins to explain the history of Krypton to Kal-El.

Guest Commentator: Sam Otten (Co-host of The Justice League Universe Podcast)

About us: DC Cinematic Minute is daily podcast doing a deep dive of the DCEU starting with Man of Steel. In this podcast, we've chopped up the film into individual minutes and each day we discuss and analyze everything what happens within that certain minute. The format is similar to Star Wars Minute. We're really passionate about the DC Universe, so this method allows us to explore the mythos of Superman and really pick apart the inner workings of the film franchise. Following Man of Steel, we'll be giving the same treatment and study to the extended cuts of BvS, Suicide Squad, and so on. Hope you'll enjoy every minute!",DC_Cinematic,5,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61t85a/podcast_man_of_steel_minute_46_w_sam_otten/,OTHER,dceuminute,61t85a,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61t85a/podcast_man_of_steel_minute_46_w_sam_otten/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61t85a/podcast_man_of_steel_minute_46_w_sam_otten/,0,2017-03-27
Weapon Materials Help,"I am a fledgeling cosplayer, with very amateur sewing and prop making skills. I used to make fake weapons in high school out of some unconventional materials, but I'd like to take a bigger step and start making some actual good looking weapons. I've used wood scraps and foam before, as well as cardboard. However, I don't know if these are best for swords, quarterstaffs, war hammers, and things like that. 

For some examples, I'd like to begin a Leona cosplay from League of Legends, and I definitely want to do justice to her sword and shield. I also want to do a Bandit Sivir cosplay at some point. Using these examples, would it be feasible to use mostly wood for these particular weapons, or are there perhaps some better options for novices?

Any advice is much appreciated!",cosplayers,4,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplayers/comments/61vhlx/weapon_materials_help/,,AstaraelRose,61vhlx,/r/cosplayers/comments/61vhlx/weapon_materials_help/,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplayers/comments/61vhlx/weapon_materials_help/,7,2017-03-27
QUESTION: how did the DCEU benefit from Suicide Squad?,"I am not very present in this sub so i do apologize if this has been asked in some other form below  
  
I am not focusing on the critical reception or the casting, or the directing or acting or writing or pacing of the movie.  
  
I am just trying to see if I missed how the DCEU benefited story and universe wise from the release of that movie.  
  
The DCEU main storyline is the ""Justice League"" storyline [unless I am misunderstanding something crucial about DCEU]. Compared to the other superhero movies before and after it, Suicide Squad just seems to be stuck there kinda randomly to me. Only thing it contributed to the DCEU seemed to be the fact that Bruce met with Waller in the mid-credit scene to get a list of metahumans from her. Besides that only movies that are reportedly coming out of it are the Gotham City Sirens, Deadshot solo spin-off and and Suicide Squad sequel but given WB's track record as of late with delays, no solid idea on when [or if] they'll be released.  
  
Basically, 6 movies spanning until 2020 have been confirmed for DCEU and Suicide Squad does not mix with any of them which makes me wonder why it was made?  
  
Just can't tell how it contributed to character/world-building that justified making an entire movie",DC_Cinematic,4,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61r8gm/question_how_did_the_dceu_benefit_from_suicide/,DISCUSSION,j0hn_r0g3r5,61r8gm,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61r8gm/question_how_did_the_dceu_benefit_from_suicide/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61r8gm/question_how_did_the_dceu_benefit_from_suicide/,19,2017-03-27

19F4A- The Girl of Steel (Supergirl RP),"I groan as I wake up, hitting my alarm on the side of my dresser. I don’t even know what time it’s set for, what time zone that I’m in. I nevertheless float up, the standard blue blankets of the Justice League Watchtower falling off me as I float higher, before I’m able to stand on the floor. Clark set me up with a nicer room than I thought I’d get, one with a view. It’s not of Earth but it’s still space. I used to be scared of space, having spent so long travelling through it. But I’ve moved past that now, accepted everything that’s happened to me. Embraced it I suppose. As I float over to the window, brushing the loose strands of long blonde hair out of my eyes, I can’t help but find myself in awe of the beauty outside the window, of the endlessness of space and everything it has to offer. I haven’t been out there yet, haven’t struck up the nerve really. Clark says that it’s fine, that the lack of oxygen doesn’t hurt me, but I can’t help but still be worried to do so. 

I’m broken out of my reverie by a knock on my door, to which I descend to the floor and walk over to open. Walking grounds me, both literally and mentally, and I find myself enjoying it, much more than I ever would have thought that I would have. When I open it I find Diana, Wonder Woman, there smiling at me. We’ve developed a close friendship, closer than I have with most other superheroes or superheroines. “Hello Kara,” Diana smiles at me, which I return. I can see her raised eyebrow at my outfit, making me blush a little as I look down at myself. I’m only wearing a pair of small pajama shorts and a big Superman shirt that I bought in Metropolis. “It was on sale,” I say quietly, making Diana let out a small laugh. “Well c’mon. I’ll show you around,” she says and I nod, stepping out and closing the door behind me, following Diana around the Watchtower.

The Watchtower is amazing, me basically speechless as Diana shows me around. It’s my first time up here, even though I’ve met many of the people here, I haven’t been made an ‘official’ member of the Justice League yet. Clark says that I need a couple more months, or maybe a couple more years before I’m ready. As much as I dislike that, I understand that Batman (Clark won’t tell me his name) wants only the most trustworthy in the League. After the tour Diana leaves me in my room, and I sit on the bed. I quickly change into my [costume](http://cdn2-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/supergirl-1x19/107910_d0845b.jpg). With a smile I look out the window one more time, grabbing my small duffel bag of my clothes, and a couple snacks that I may have taken from the kitchen. With a sigh I walk to the door, and close it behind me before I make my way to the teleporter to get back to the Fortress of Solitude.

---------------

So in this roleplay I am Kara Zor-El, also known as Supergirl. Although I have the appearance of Melissa Benoist, this is the Supergirl in the comic book universe, just having her appearance. You can either be an OC or an established DC character, although I would prefer if you were a superhero rather than a villain, although I am open to you being a villain if that is what you prefer. If you plan to be an OC, you can be either another superhero present at the Watchtower at this moment, or rather a normal human being on Earth. The same goes if you plan to be an established character. I would prefer though if your character was not superpowered. This prompt is meant to be long-term and detailed, both with the building of the relationship between our two characters, but also Kara fully coming to grips with being on Earth, as well as the struggles with a relationship between Kara, being one of the most powerful beings on Earth, and someone without powers. This will be a slow burn, with us building not only the world, but the characters as well.

We don't need to go directly off the prompt, since it can be either a starting off point, or just a writing sample if you prefer. If you decide to message, if you could title it *[Your character] and Kara Zor-El* that would be greatly appreciated. Just so I know you read this far and to better organize. 

One character I have been craving with Kara is Lena Luthor, if anybody is willing to and watches the Supergirl show. If you aren't Lena that doesn't mean I won't respond, just I'll likely give priority to someone who is well written and plays Lena. I am open to both male and female characters. I look forward to talking to you guys :) ",dirtypenpals,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/61ucrl/19f4a_the_girl_of_steel_supergirl_rp/,Long Term RP,katiesarah3,61ucrl,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/61ucrl/19f4a_the_girl_of_steel_supergirl_rp/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/61ucrl/19f4a_the_girl_of_steel_supergirl_rp/,0,2017-03-27

QUESTION: Is Robin Wright in JL?,"We know Antiope is in WW, but is she also featuring in JL? Because we know Hippolyta will appear, and that Justice League will feature a huge Amazonian war scene. It would make sense that the Amazon's best warrior would be there.

Why is getting hired as an adjuster at one of the big league companies (State Farm/Progressive/AmFam/etc.) so impossible?,"Maybe I'm posting this in the wrong place, my apologies if that's the case.

I'm one of the rare few who graduated college and actually WANTS to be a claims adjuster. I'm two years out of college, have a degree in Criminal Justice, worked customer service all through college and have 1.5 years experience in sales at a Honda dealership. 

I applied for Geico, which from what I've researched, is among the easier companies to get into as long as you're willing to cooperate with their training. Shot down before I even got an interview.

I dropped an application for State Farm, and flunked the phone interview and they're ""keeping my file.""

Applied for Progressive, despite hearing how long and convoluted their hiring process is and their long, required training class in Cleveland. Failed the data analysis assessment, and got barred from applying again for 6 months. Applied again after 6 months, passed the assessment, but didn't make it past the phone interview. Two of my smart friends were shot down by Prog as well. 

Got an in-person interview with AmFam, but no offer. 

Applied at Travelers, and was offered a ""waitlist"" position in case someone didn't show up on their first day. The waitlist wasn't needed. 

.... I honestly just really want to get into claims, so that I can eventually get into complex claim handling (theft/fire/vandalism/fraud). But if I can't get hired as a regular adjuster first, I don't know how to make that work. I've thought about trying to start at the bottom in the call center and try to get promoted within, but I hear about so many people getting into Geico/Progressive without a claims background and I want to know what these people have that I don't.

Any insight/advice on getting hired as an adjuster would be really great. Thanks!

"This year is shaping up to be a huge one for film. Here's a list of 45+ promising movies to watch out for this year, including basic descriptions, early reviews and trailers. Organised between original and franchise films.","Every year I feel like I miss a heap of movies that I know exist or have been recommended that fly under my radar when they’re in cinemas. This year I starting making a list in Google Keep to keep track of films to watch, and it started getting so big that I figured it’d be worth sharing.  There are definitely some really promising sequels and franchise movies coming out this year, but I’ve gone into more detail for the original films given that they don’t tend to have the same marketing presence, and because so many look like they’ll be excellent.  Let me know if there’s anything promising that I’ve missed, I’ll come back and keep this last updated so you can refer to it in the future!


# First, 28 non-sequel, non-reboot, non-remake films to watch out for (will be updated with 10 more suggestions from the comments):

There’s a huge number of promising original movies here. There’s not a single one here that looks bad on paper (IMO), whether it be because of the director, cast or because of a unique plot. 


### [Battle of the Sexes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4622512/)

A sports drama-comedy starring Emma Stone and Steve Carrell. **Directed by the directors of Little Miss Sunshine, written by the writers of Slumdog Millionaire, cinematographer of La La Land and the composer of Moonlight.** Plot loosely based on the 1973 tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. 


### [The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3675680/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

An upcoming historical period drama film starring Mark Rylance as Pope Pius IX, Oscar Isaac and Isaac Eshete. **Directed by Steven Spielberg and composed by John Williams.**


### [A Ghost Story](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6265828/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“A ghost (Casey Affleck) silently observes his grieving widow (Rooney Mara) in his beloved home.“ **Really solid reviews so far**, and a great cast. Definitely one to look forward to.


### [Baby Driver](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“Talented getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort) relies on the beat of his personal soundtrack to be the best in the game. After meeting the woman (Lily James) of his dreams, he sees a chance to ditch his shady lifestyle and make a clean break.” **A new Edgar Wright original**. If that isn't enough to sell you, the movie is so far on 100% with an average rating of 8.5/10 on Rotten Tomatoes. Trailer [here.](https://youtu.be/z2z857RSfhk)


### [Gemini](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5795086/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“A heinous crime tests the complex relationship between a tenacious personal assistant and her Hollywood starlet boss.”  Directed by Aaron Kratz, **extremely positive reviews from critics out of SXSW.** Looks like a great mystery-thriller.


### [Molly’s Game](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4209788/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“The true story of Molly Bloom, a young skier and former Olympic hopeful becomes a successful entrepreneur (and a target of an FBI investigation) when she establishes a high-stakes, international poker game.”  **Screenplay adapted by Aaron Sorkin and directed by him in his directorial debut. Starring Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba, Kevin Costner, Brian d'Arcy James and Chris O'Dowd.** Can’t wait for this one, amazing writer, great cast, and a possibly great director (hopefully a bit of David Fincher has rubbed onto Sorkin). 


### [The Death of Stalin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4686844/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

A political satire chronicling the events that transpired after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953.  **Directed and written by  the creator of Veep and The Thick of It, Armando Iannucci.**


### [Dunkirk](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5013056/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“Follows the true story of the Dunkirk evacuation in WW2.”  **The next film by Christopher Nolan, starring Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Mark Rylance and others.**  Can’t wait for this one, obviously. Trailer [here.](https://youtu.be/F-eMt3SrfFU)


### [Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5027774/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“After months have passed without a culprit in her daughter’s murder case, Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) makes a bold move, painting three signs leading into her town with a controversial message directed at William Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), the town’s revered chief of police.” This one looks great. **Written and directed by Martin McDonagh, the creator of In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths.** This guy doesn’t make movies often, but when he does they don’t disappoint. Trailer [here.](https://youtu.be/Jit3YhGx5pU)


### [The Snowman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1758810/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“Detective Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) investigates the disappearance of a woman whose pink scarf is found wrapped around an ominous-looking snowman."" **Directed by Tomas Alfredson (Let The Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) and starring Michael Fassbender**, this is looking to be a pretty great British crime drama. Based on the novel of the same name. 


### [Coco](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380307/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)

“Coco follows a 12-year-old boy named Miguel who sets off a chain of events relating to a century-old mystery, leading to an extraordinary family reunion.”  **An original Pixar film!** I’m keen, especially after Inside Out. Trailer [here.](https://youtu.be/zNCz4mQzfEI)


### [Colossal ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4680182/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“A bizarre sci-fi comedy starring Anne Hathaway who discovers that she is strangely connected to a monster attacking Seoul, South Korea. When she moves, the monster moves.” Looks bizarre and creative, with **positive (but also divisive) reviews. Seems like the kind of movie that could become a quiet cult classic.** Trailer [here.](https://youtu.be/Q8hpm_BcHKE)


### [Wind River](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5362988/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“An FBI agent teams up with a veteran game tracker to investigate a murder that occurred on a Native American reservation.” **Written and directed by Taylor Sheridan, the writer of Hell or High Water. Starring Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner. Really solid reviews so far.**


### [The Disaster Artist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3521126/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

Based on the book of the same name, “The Disaster Artist is a 2017 American biographical comedy film directed, produced by, and starring James Franco. Based on Greg Sestero's non-fiction book of the same name, the film chronicles the making of the 2003 cult film The Room.”   **Early reviews are fantastic, supposedly Franco’s best work.**  I’m so excited for this.


### [Mother](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5109784/)

""Centers on a couple whose relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence."" **Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky, starring Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem and Domnhall Gleeson.** What an amazing team, another one I'm very keen for.

### [The Book of Henry](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4572792/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“When a boy who is being raised by his single mother develops feelings for the girl next door, he plots a murder to protect the girl from the ongoing harm of her father. “  **A Colin Treverrow (Jurassic World, Safety not Guaranteed) film starring Naomi Watts, Maddie Ziegler and Jacob Tremblay.**


### [The Big Sick](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5462602/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“The Big Sick is based on the real courtship of Kumail Nanjiani and his now-wife, Emily Gordon. Kumail's traditional Muslim family are unhappy with his relationship with Emily, an American. When Emily is waylaid by a mysterious illness, Kumail must take charge of the crisis with her parents, Beth and Terry“.  **Written by and starring Kumail Nanjiani.  If the extremely positive reviews from SXSW** are anything to go by, this is worth a watch.


### [Free Fire ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158096/)

“Set in Boston in 1978, a meeting in a deserted warehouse between two gangs turns into a shootout and a game of survival.” **A fun, intense, “bottle-episode” kind of movie starring Brie Larson, Armie Hammer, Sharlto Copley and Cillian Murphy.** Coming in April, and **early reviews are very solid.** Unlikely to be a game-changer, but apparently a really enjoyable watch. Trailer here.


### [Lucky](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5859238/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4)

“Lucky follows the spiritual journey of a 90-year-old atheist — played by Harry Dean Stanton — and the quirky characters that inhabit his off-the-map desert town. He finds himself at the precipice of life, thrust into a journey of self-exploration.” **Directed by John Carroll Lynch and starring Harry Dean Stanton. Another film with great reviews out of SXSW.**


### [Raw](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4954522/?ref_=nv_sr_2)

“Stringent vegetarian Justine (Garance Marillier) encounters a decadent, merciless and dangerously seductive world during her first week at veterinary school.”  A directorial debut from Julia Ducournau, **Raw is apparently hard to watch, but also hard to look away from.**  Trailer here (NSFW).


### [Small Town Crime](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5751998/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“An alcoholic ex-cop finds the body of a young woman and, through an act of self-redemption, becomes hell-bent on finding the killer.” **Directed by Eshom and Ian Nelms, starring John Hawkes and Octavia Spencer. Early reviews and first thoughts are quite promising.**


### [Wonder](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543472/?ref_=nv_sr_2)

“Auggie Pullman *(Jacob Tremblay)* is a young boy born with a facial deformity who moves into a new school and tries to fit in.“ **Directed by Stephen Chbosky (writer and director of Perks of Being a Wallflower), also starring Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson.**


### [American Made](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3532216/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“American Made tells the story of Barry Seal *(Tom Cruise)*, a pilot who is recruited by the CIA to help counter the emerging communist threat in Central America. Seal's role in this major CIA covert operation led in turn to his involvement with the Medellin carte”.  A biographical drama crime-thriller, **directed by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Edge of Tomorrow).**


### [Personal Shopper ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4714782/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“A young American in Paris works as a personal shopper for a celebrity. She seems to have the ability to communicate with spirits, like her recently deceased twin brother. Soon, she starts to receive ambiguous messages from an unknown source.”  **Directed by Olivier Assayas and featuring an apparently excellent performance by Kristen Stewart. Good to great reviews so far.**


### [Logan Lucky](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5439796/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“Trying to reverse a family curse, brothers Jimmy (Channing Tatum) and Clyde Logan (Adam Driver) set out to execute an elaborate robbery during the legendary Coca-Cola 600 race at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina during Memorial Day weekend.”  **Directed by Steven Soderbergh (Ocean’s 11, Out of Sight, Contagion), starring Channing Tatum, Daniel Craig, Adam Driver, Hilary Swank and more.**  Absolutely stacked cast, and a great director. Can’t wait for this. 


### [The Dark Tower](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648190/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

Based on the book series by Stephen King, I expect the IMDB plot will not do the story justice: “The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where ""the world has moved on"" in pursuit of the man in black. Also searching for the fabled Dark Tower, in the hopes that reaching it will preserve his dying world.”.  **Directed by Nikolaj Arcel and starring Idris Elba, Kathryn Winnick and Matthew McConaughey.**


### [The Circle](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4287320/?ref_=nv_sr_1)

“A young tech worker takes a job at a powerful Internet corporation, quickly rises up the company's ranks, and soon finds herself in a perilous situation concerning privacy, surveillance and freedom.”  **Directed by James Ponsoldt (The Spectacular Now, End of the Tour), and starring Emma Watson and Tom Hanks.** Trailer here. 


### [Get Out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448/)
“A young African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate.” This has been out for a while in the US (unfortunately will have to wait til May in Australia!), but I’ve included it just in case. **Sitting at 99% on Rotten Tomatoes with only a single rotten review.  Apparently excellent.**

## Additions from comments:

### [Wonder Wheel]
""Plot unknown. Described as a period drama set in New York in the 1950s."" **Written and Directed by Woody Allen, starring Kate Winslet, Juno Temple and Justin Timberlake.**

### [Annihilation]
""A biologist signs up for a dangerous, secret expedition where the laws of nature don't apply."" Based on the book of the same name.** Directed and adapted by Alex Garland, the writer of Ex Machina. Starring Natalie Portman, Oscar Isaac and Jennifer Jason Leigh.**

### [Mute]
""A mute bartender goes up against his city's gangsters in an effort to find out what happened to his missing partner."" Directed by Duncan Jones, written by  Michael Robert Johnson and Duncan Jones. Starring Alexander Skarsgård, Justin Theroux and Sam Rockwell.

### [Submergence]
I feel like the IMDB description of this gives a bit too much away, so I've found a more generic description: ""An upcoming American-French-Spanish romantic thriller film, based on the novel of same name."" **Directed by Wim Wenders, starring Alicia Vikander, James McAvoy and Charlotte Rampling.**

### [Suburbicon]
There aren't many plot details for this, but it's been in the making for decades. Apparently the Coen brothers wrote the script in [1986](http://collider.com/joel-silver-the-nice-guys-wonder-woman-interview/). **Directed by George Clooney, starring Matt Damon, Julianne Moore, Josh Brolin and Oscar Isaac.**  Definitely promising on paper.

Discussion: What are you concerns for Justice League?,"Let me start off by saying that i think everything looks great so far, the trailer was excellent and has me 100% hyped. But what are some things that you aren't sure about how the movie will handle it? For me its really just two things:
1.  Superman showing up in the last quarter: I feel like everybody at this point is predicting that he shows up somewhere in the last battle of the movie, when Steppenwolf is about to kill somebody. But i'm a little scared of that's what'll happen because its really predictable and i feel as though it really just seem shoe-horned.
2. Deathstroke's involvement: I can't really remember if this was ever confirmed or not so if it wasn't then just ignore this part, but i'm not exactly sure how he's supposed to fit in this movie? I know Lex is in it because he had contact with Steppenwolf and all that, but idk what that has to do with Deathstroke. I know it has been theorized that he hires Deathstroke to off Batman but what place does that really have in the movie other than setting up The Batman?

But yeah those are really the only things i'm afraid, i'm sure Cyborg's CGI will look way better when its closer to release time.

THEORY: The Flash Travels Back In Time In Justice League,"WARNING!
For those who have not watched the Justice League trailer (if you haven't, what are you doing?) or 'Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox', This post might contain spoilers.

So the first Justice League trailer has been out for a few days now and I'm pretty excited. I'm most excited to see Ezra Millers portrayal of Barry Allen/The Flash.

The trailer is cool and all but theres a moment which caught my eye and thats between minutes 1:44 and 1:46. In these 2 seconds we first see a huge bright blue explosion which happens in a city like setting (much like the setting where Aquaman hops on to the Batmobile). We then quickly see the flash running in the speed force quite hectically. It almost reminds me of when Barry runs into the speed force in 'Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox' (can you see where I'm going with this?) I don't think those two shots in the trailer were put together randomly at all.

My theory is that Barry travels back in time as a result of running away from a huge explosion (an explosion that kills the other JL members?) I mean, why not? We know that this version of the Flash has been around since 2009 thanks to a rap sheet from Suicide Squad, so he probably knows his shit.

What if the JL start off on the wrong foot, and dont establish a game plan when going in to stop Steppenwolf? Perhaps Bruce anticipated this and knew the Scarlet Speedster would be able to go back and warn him? Maybe Barry telling Bruce what they're up against in the future is the reason why he has a more armoured suit?

In the promotional image with the Flash, Batman and Wonder Woman released on December 20th, we see the the Flash has a injury on his right leg, almost like the injury the Flash got in Flashpoint. The placement is almost EXACTLY the same.

I think Barry and Bruce will have a moment in the film, much like that moment in Flashpoint when Thomas Wayne tells Barry he has to go back in time and fix everything. The shot of Barry running hectically in the speed force even reminds me of what the speed force looked like in Flashpoint.

So yeah, thats my theory. I probably thought too much of it but i dont feel like this is something Zack Snyder wouldn't do.",DC_Cinematic,11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61z9h0/theory_the_flash_travels_back_in_time_in_justice/,DISCUSSION,riyansporre,61z9h0,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61z9h0/theory_the_flash_travels_back_in_time_in_justice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/61z9h0/theory_the_flash_travels_back_in_time_in_justice/,11,2017-03-28

I have some questions about The Justice League,"Just saw the new trailer and I have some questions.

1) how is Batman remotely useful when compared to everyone else? He seems way out of his depth here. He usually has trouble dealing with people like Bane and now he thinks he can fight near Gods?

2) is Superman faster than The Flash?

3) is Superman stronger than everyone else? Can he beat Aquaman in water?

4) Does Aquaman have powers out of water apart from jumping high?

5) who made Cyborg? And why can't Earth just make lots of him. 

6) are they a private club, corporation or a government agency or something else?

Small idea I had for a new DC Cinematic Universe,"DC obviously doesn't want to copy Marvel's formula, which is perfectly understandable, but because of that, they've been burning through a good chunk of good material for standalone movies and squeezing them all into one, just so they can catch up with Marvel. Then I saw the Netflix version of A Series of Unfortunate Events. For those unaware, the show is narrated by Lemony Snicket (played by Kronk from Emperor's New Groove), a detective investigating the events of the series from the present day. What does this have to do with DC? Simple, what if DC could use a similar framing device to make them stick out from Marvel?

Most of DC's main heroes like Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman all got their start in the 20th century, like in the golden age. Their legacy still lives on to this day, but superheroes have since died down ever since the passing of Batman, which led to the Justice League going separate ways. The first movie in this new world would be an ""original"" one set in present day, which would explain the basic concept of the franchise, set up different heroes, get the repetitive stuff out of the way (like Batman's origin) and hint towards a new generation of heroes for the Justice League movie (e.x. Terry McGinnis as the second Batman) alongside the return of immortal characters like Superman.

How does this sound?",fixingmovies,9,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/620lx1/small_idea_i_had_for_a_new_dc_cinematic_universe/,DC,Realshow,620lx1,/r/fixingmovies/comments/620lx1/small_idea_i_had_for_a_new_dc_cinematic_universe/,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/620lx1/small_idea_i_had_for_a_new_dc_cinematic_universe/,32,2017-03-28
Matt Cleary's 100 Best Rugby League Players Since 1980,"This list, rather, is the best 100 players who laced up a boot in Australia from 1980. 100 years of history, but we’ll confine our quest to the empirical of 37. The end of the Fulton era, Dawn of State Of Origin, when the author was ten years old and can “see” all the following heroes in famous, technicolour dreams. And on YouTube.

And they are:

**100 – Mark Geyer**
The great ‘MG’ thundered and frothed around the footy field, all hard charges, long arms and crazy eyes. To coin AC/DC’s love sonnet ‘Live Wire’, Geyer was hotter than a rollin’ dice, wilder than a drunken fight. Had referee David Manson not stood between he and Wally Lewis in Origin II of 1991, Geyer would have planted more than one upon the chin of His Majesty The King. Not to pigeon-hole him (!) though because he was a ripper of a footy player who famously charged hard onto the Raiders’ short drop-out in the ’91 grand final and dished for Royce Simmons, who scored. And there were wild and woolly-good times in the west.

**99 – Nathan Hindmarsh**
The hardest worker since Donald Trump’s alternative fact checker, the ‘Spuddie from Robbo’ had a large back-rig, shorts that couldn’t stay up, and hair that looked like he cut himself once every year or so with a pair of his grandad’s secateurs. Also played 330 games for the Parramatta Eels.

**98 – Phil Blake**
Turned up at Manly in 1982 aged about 11 and ripped off more tricks than Mandrake. Could chip-and-chase for Australia, though never did, his rep career peaking off the bench for the Blues in Origin III of ’89. Also played for Souths, Saints, Norths, Canberra, Auckland, Warrington and Wigan.

**97 – Les Boyd**
Mark Geyer before Mark Geyer came along. Mark Geyer when it was more than allowed, it was mandatory, to be Mark Geyer. Boyd could really play, though. It’s just that if he was fouled early – as he often was – he’d spend the whole game trying to square up. Broke Darryl Brohman’s jaw in Origin I of ’83. Later rubbed out by judiciary chairman Jim Comans’ great new broom of justice.

**96 – Kevin Hastings**
Would’ve played for New South Wales and Australia (and should’ve if you ask many Rooster people) had it not been for Steve Mortimer, Peter Sterling and ‘Slippery’ Steve Morris who had dibs on the rep seven. Yet ‘Horrie’ stayed home and had the Chooks humming.

**95 – Craig Fitzgibbon**
Beating heart and James-Brown-belting-out-Sex-Machine soul of the Roosters in their dynasty of 2001 to ’03. A second-rower who could run 80 metres and kick goals. Fair player, Fitzy.

**94 – Cliff Lyons**
Soft hands and silky skills, the brilliant five-eighth was a dream to run off for rampaging forwards, angle-running centres and Steve Menzies who profited to the tune of 180 tries, many from sniffing about our Cliff.

**93 – Steve Morris**
‘Slippery’ was so fast his patented chip and chase was effectively bunt the ball over the line of defence and burn everyone with incredible pace. Can’t have weighed more than Hugh Bowman; could run like Winx.

**92 – Tim Brasher**
Kept Brett Mullins out of State of Origin. And also this list.

**91 – Rod Reddy**
The author’s favourite footy player as a boy, ‘The Rocket’ would thunder around the field like a moustachioed bottle of OP rum. Never saw a jaw that couldn’t be improved with his forearm. Rumoured to be ‘The Phantom Biter’.

**90 – Gary Freeman**
‘The Wiz’ played 45 times for New Zealand and played like Les Boyd in Hugh Bowman’s body.

**89 – Geoff Toovey**
Snowy-haired and often-stitched Manly halfback considered the toughest pound-for-pound bit of gristle to bleed on Brookie since Terry Randall. Only just bigger than the Winfield Cup he lifted over his head in ’96.

**88 – Sam Thaiday**
‘Third-man-in Thaiday’ has a tattoo which reads “One brother bleeds, all brothers bleed”. Super footy player who runs hard wide of the ruck and full tilt into State of Origin melees. Funny man.

**87 – Chris Anderson**
Quick little wing man who scurried about like a frightened meerkat. Played 230 games for Berries-Bulldogs.

**86 – Chris Close**
Queensland didn’t make shorts big enough to hold ‘Choppy’ Close’s thighs. Bigger thighs than Mal Meninga. Very good thighs. And when Origin was born in 1980 it was Choppy Close’s thunder thighs that rent the Blues asunder and won our Choppy the man-of-the-match award.

**85 – David Gillespie**
A thick-necked, wide boulder of a human being who could shoot his shoulders into the sternums of the game’s hardest chargers and stop them like a shotgun full of pellets of hot dung. An absolute brute. Nice fellah, though.

**84 – Darius Boyd**
If there’s been one constant in Queensland’s dominance over NSW in the last decade or so, it’s Cameron Smith. But Darius has been there too. And he’s really, really good. People think he isn’t because they don’t sort of like him. But he is, he’s really good, Darius. Top player.

**83 – Brett Kimmorley**
‘Noddy’ kept ‘Joey’ Johns out of the No.7 jumper in the 2000 State of Origin series, which tells you plenty about the dangerous drugs consumed by NSW selectors at that time. Kimmorley was a super halfback, however. Stocky and strong, high-skilled – the rich man’s Mat Orford.

**82 – Brett Stewart**
Old ‘Snake Hips’ was a crowd favourite at Brookvale Oval because he scored more tries than Cristiano Ronaldo scored invites to short-term liaisons in the finest nightclub in all Madrid.

**81 – Benji Marshall**
Hot stepping hep-cat from Whakatane who bedazzled the game of rugby league like Haley’s Comet if Haley’s Comet actually did something rather than sit there fuzzy in the sky. No-one had ever seen anything like Benji Marshall. An excited Wests Tigers’ recruitment man exclaimed to Tim Sheens: “I’ve found a kid who can step in mid-air!” Paul Vautin watched him rip off some manoeuvres and remarked: “And that. What do you call that?”

**80 – Dale Shearer**
Slim-hipped and eely, ‘Rowdy’ Shearer had shades of Doc Emmett Brown from Back To The Future crossed with Manly cult wing man Stuie Davis. Shearer was heaps better than Stuie, though. They shouldn’t even be really mentioned in the same sentence. It would be an insult to Dale Shearer. Remember that.

**79 – Greg Dowling**
Giant shaggy man-beast who’d thunder into opponents like a wild slab of mobile horse-meat. Famous for fighting Kevin Tamati on the sidelines at Lang Park in a Test match in ’85, and surviving.

**78 – Matthew Bowen**
‘Mango’ Bowen from Hope Vale in the north of the northernmost reaches of our mighty island home ran around Townsville like a wallaby trailing a string of firecrackers. Cracking player. The best fun running man of his time.

**77 – Brent Tate**
Diamond-hard and laser-straight centre who broke his neck and wore a brace and slayed ‘em from day dot. Great player, B Tate.

**76 – Brett Morris**
The Son of Slippery would give Winx a run. But Winx would win. Because Winx is a horse. Horses are faster than people. Brett Morris is pretty fast, though. Just not as fast as a horse. Particularly not Winx, which is very fast. And a horse.

**75 – Craig Young**
‘Albert’ Young was a policeman who rampaged up the park and popped tidy short balls for Slippery, Rocket, and others.

"[H] trades, Cerebus, Kabuki, Gaiman, Moore, Paul Pope, Rucka, manga, Euro-smut, more [W] $$","My continuing attempt to clear the house of comics I mostly haven’t touched for a decade! Since my primary motivation is moving these I’ve broken them up into lots. I don’t want to unload just one or two specific comics -- more interested in reclaiming space than making money. I’ll listen to offers and of course I’m happy to answer specific questions, check an edition, take a snapshot, etc.

Unless otherwise noted the books seem to my completely inexpert eye to be in at least “very fine” condition. If you’re really concerned about a specific book’s condition let me know. These comics have lived all their lives in a non-smoking home. There are a whole bunch of them so prepare for a wall of text!

There are a few NSFW lots towards the end so please avert your eyes if necessary.

Asking prices don’t include shipping. Some of these lots are pretty heavy -- my daughter has only recently outweighed my Cerebus. In recognition of this I’ve tried to set prices well below Ebay data. (If you live in the Orlando area or will be visiting Disney World by car we can dispense with shipping!)

"Making BvS better: A few small changes that IMO, would improve BvS.","First of all, I apologise if a similar post already exists, or if I'm posting this in the wrong place, I did try searching but couldn't find anything. 

So, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice... It's a movie that divides opinion, that's for sure. 

Personally, I kinda liked it, but it had a few things that I thought were kind of dumb. 

From what I've seen, I honestly don't think Zack Snyder knows what to do with Superman. It's not that his take on the character is bad, it's just not particularly good either. I feel it's maybe too bland? Perhaps it's because he's not had time to shine as Superman? I think that he's been too bogged down with the seriousness that has run through both MOS and BvS. I feel that Superman is really missing the ""big blue Boy Scout"" aspect. In my opinion, Zack Snyder should focus a bit less on making Superman this guilt ridden messiah figure battling with his morality, and show him as how I feel he has always been presented: The human ideal. A good, selfless and charming man who is confident in his sense of right and wrong. Although I see the problem, I'm not a writer, I'm not entirely sure what you'd do to fix this really. 

Now on to the fun stuff.

So, one of my gripes with the film is, what is the deal with the custom Lexcorp bullets? I don't understand why a billionaire evil genius would go through all the effort of attempting to frame Superman for murder, but use custom made bullets that can seemingly be traced back to him? Why not just use regular old bullets that anyone can get hold of? Instead here's what I would have done:

Instead of bullets, Lex has invented weapons that he plants on the soldiers. Miniature devices that combust on command, and burn at the same temperature as Supermans heat vision. They destroy any evidence of themselves while leaving the victims charred as if Superman had killed them. And let's say Lois found one that hadn't detonated for some reason instead of a bullet in a book. This solves two problems. First, the stupidity of pointless custom bullets, second, another point I will address later. 

Another problem that I know I'm not alone in having, is the ridiculous Martha scene. So instead of Batman having a total 180 and deciding to be best mates with Supes just because their mothers have the same name, have them fight as normal. But when you get to the end of the fight, Batman standing over a beaten Superman, ready to deliver the killing blow, have Superman suddenly notice something with his X-Ray vision. (Similar to the ""Bruce, your heart..."" Panel in TDKR)

It turns out, Lex has planted one of his miniature heat devices on Batman to ensure his death if the fight didn't go as planned. Superman uses his last ounce of energy to disable remove the device as it detonates. Batman then realised how wrong he's been. Superman is good and trustworthy after all, and Lex has been scheming to make them enemies. Superman wakes up but isn't fully recovered. He tells Batman about Martha and Batman goes off to save here. We can still have the awesome warehouse fight. 

Now here's my final change, which is quite a bit one. The final threat isn't Doomsday. I really don't know why they tried to shoehorn in The Death Of Superman story. It just leaves us with a character who was already underdeveloped, now dead, but without suspense as we all know he's coming back for Justice League. And also it seems a waste of what could make a great Superman film. So instead, remember Mr Angry No Legs? I don't remember his name, but you'll remember his character. Now when I saw this movie, I was convinced that this guy was more than he seemed. I was sure that he was going to end up as another Superman villain, that being Metallo. So why not? It was all set up: A man who hates Superman, is crippled and has a vendetta, and who is vulnerable to manipulation by Lex Luthor. So instead of a bland suicide bomber who barely made any difference, why not have him become the Kryptonite powered cyborg Metallo? He could be who Lex sends to kill Superman instead. Batman and Superman couldn't beat him on their own, but together they could use their combined skills and strengths to beat him. I feel like it would be a far more organic and satisfying conclusion to the plot. 

After that they could beat Lex, and take him to prison, but he warns them that he has learned from the Kryptonian ship, and that Darkseid is coming. Superman and Batman then go off with a new mission: To find the other metahumans... The Justice League....

"Recent events: Abbas meets with EU, Arab Leaders to create consensus on demands for a peace deal. Trump signals that he will commence push for peace effort 'soon'","http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=e2jvCGa68642329866ae2jvCG

PA president Abbas: 

&gt; “Our meeting today was important to discuss the latest developments in international efforts to find the best way to reach a just and comprehensive peace between us and the Israelis in light of the intention of the US administration under President (Donald) Trump to work for peace,” said Abbas.

&gt; “There were many contacts and meetings, and we are continuing discussions for the success of the American and international efforts, and I have assured President Trump that we are ready for a peace deal,” he said.

&gt; “We are committed to a just, comprehensive and permanent peace with our Israeli neighbors based on international and United Nations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative that would end the Israeli occupation of the territory of the State of Palestine occupied since 1967 with East Jerusalem as its capital, which we want to keep as an open city for the followers of the three monotheistic religions,” said Abbas.

&gt; However, he added, “continuation of settlement activities and expropriation of Palestinian land will lead to the one-state situation with an apartheid system. Repression and occupation will not bring security and peace, which come only through justice, equality and good neighborly relations. We are ready for these things and we hope the government of Israel and the Israeli people will not waste this opportunity for peace.”





EU foreign policy chief Mogerini: 

&gt; Mogherini, from her part, stressed that “peace between Israel and Palestine is a top priority for the European Union and it will remain a top priority in our political agenda.” She reiterated the EU’s position on the Middle East peace process and its commitment to the two-state solution.

&gt; “We remain committed to a negotiated two-state solution that remains for us the only viable way to end the conflict and all claims. Our EU policy on this has not changed. We recognize changes to the pre-1967 borders, including with regard to Jerusalem, only when agreed by the parties. Our position on Jerusalem as future capital of both states has not changed and we support Palestinian presence in East Jerusalem, both in political and financial terms,” said Mogherini.

&gt; She added: “I re-expressed to the President what I often express publicly, also recently, the strong European Union’s opposition to the Israeli settlement policy and demolitions of Palestinian-owned structures. The European Union considers settlements to be illegal under international law and this also has not changed in our policy.”

President Trump: 

&gt; US President Donald Trump has sent a message to Jerusalem saying that he intends to advance a plan for negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians “very soon,” Channel 2 News reports.

&gt; As such, Jason Greenblatt, the representative for international negotiations by the president of the United States, will meet tomorrow with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Jordan at a meeting of the Arab League.





In terms of upcoming events, the Arab Summit will convene on Wednesday, and Abbas is expected to go to the white house in mid-april.

you have been challenged on killing this character with a little twist,"background: the gods (lets just say mostly of the gods of all the universes) decide that they need to clean some annoying characters from the multiverse, with that in mind they call the one that they throught is more prepared for the job, you, given your inmense meta knowledge of this characters and general knowledge of most of the multiverse you are given with the task of killing them

for make things a little fare for you the gods gave you acces to all the multiverse weapons that you can imagine, excluding the too powerfull ones, so that you can succed in your empress

wipe the floor with those bastards

rules:

1- you have unlimited preptime for all the rounds until you think you are prepared

2- your victim have one month prep and knows before hand what to expect (that you are a human that have a shit ton of powerful shit), but he doesnt know what kind of equipment, weapons and armour you have only that is going too be the hardest fight of their entire life

3- in that time you are reaching the destinatination of the fight so you cant prepare for whatever countermeasure he is preparing but you can expect things and prepare for them beforehand

4- you need to win with a solid 7 out of 10 (unless the contrary is said), not more not less is the gods desire if you disobey they are going to wipe you from existance so better be carefull, thats because they want to see a good figth and not a lolstomp

5- you have your current stats, but of course they can be multiplied by some of the armour or equipment that you have, the gods want to know how powerfull you are without nothing so a little description of your stats can be helpfull, althrought is not necesary

6- no op equipment like the infinity gauntlet with the heart of the universe and shit like that, powerfull equipment is allowed in the harder rounds but not godly equipment (unless say the contrary)

7-this is for the people that want to reply the comments of the brave warriors that are fighting, you are going to defend the enemy, give reasons why he loses or he wins with a bigger or a lower margin of what have been stated, of course the warrior is going to defend himself, just be serious and accept defeat or victory like men and women

8- you preserve the equipment from past rounds, of course you can leave it if you thing it gives you an unfair advantage against the next oponent and recover whetever you want

9-your energies, your stamina and your wounds are completly heal after each round

10- you can modify your body to make you stronger or give you more abilities that can be useful, just nothing too extreme 

example: you can give yourself ciber adjustments like a new eye or a new arm but you can replace you whole body with the one of a machine or you can give yourself some usefull magic tatto like the one of far cry 3 but you cant transform yourself into a member of the god hand or things like that

rounds:

r1: you are going against no other than gerald the rivia, end game

   -r1.2: now gerald have the help of yennefer and triss

   -r1.3: ciri joins the fray

-

-

-

r2: now you need to fight against samurai jack, jack has full equipment including his sword

   -r2.2: now jack has the help of the daughters of aku

-

-

-

r3: now your going against no other than batman, can you beat the prep lord

   -r3.2: now batman has the help of all the members of the bat family, all

   -r3.3: now batman has the help of the justice league, this doesnt include supes througth, he is making other thing so he can help, but the rest of the justice league is there

-

-

-

r4:now you are going against doctor doom (no god doom)

   -r4.2: doom convinces the avengers that you are a powerful villain that wants to destroy earth so they decide to prepare and are completly willed to help doom, you cant say nothing to convince them of the contrary so you need to kill them too

   -r4.3: the fantastic four joins the fray

-

-

-

r5: now is time for a big challenge, you with all the equipment you can have vs goku, goku decides to train for the battle, current goku, time room allowed but only one day

   -r5.2: all the z fighters join the fray, knowing that you are a powerfull being that want to kill them all they are going to fight at the same time like a team, not bills or whiss

   -r5.3: now bills and whiss are willed to fight against you recognizing you as a thread to all the multiverse

because this is a more dificult fight the gods give you access to more powerfull equipment and allows you a bigger confort zone, you can have a 6-8 out of 10 fight

-

-

-

-

-

-

-

final round: heres the kicker, because you have became so powerful you have disobey the gods and start a crusade to conquere the multiverse, obtaining new and more powerful equipment the gods decide to bring the more prepared being to counter the new force, yourself, creating a time clone of your own being you are given with the task of defeating yourself ending this for good

also new rules:

1-you have total access to the whole catalog of weapons, armour, equipment and whatever you decide except the things that your other you already have, those are gone for good

2-you can call for help from powerful beings except gods, gods dont want to get caught in the fray of the fight and die or get harmed, no god wants to risk so no gods

3-also you need to convince the hero (or villain) to help you even at the risk of their life, going by character of course,

4- you have unlimited prep time but the more time you spend your other you also use it going on a multiversal rampage killing trillions if not more and becoming more powerful adquiring new and more powerful weapons, basically all the time you spend he spends it either, so you need to hurry, no presure at all

5- he is so crazy of power at this point that any try on convincing him of giving back or surrender are worthless, also the moment he sees all your powerfull equpment he is going to be completly willed of killing you to obtain all that tasty loot and if you go without equipment he is going to kill you also, because he sees you like nothing but a clone that needs to be destroyed

final rule: if you manage to slay yourself you are also going to disapear, this was make in order that the clone doesnt go rampant if he succeds, the moment the original dies the clone also dies, you are chained by something bigger than any force in the multiverse and the gods themselves limit every weapon so that you can escape your destiny, you know this and also you know that not making anything means the dead of countless lives throught the multiverse

Live Action Titans,"Just for fun, let's say you have the ability to cancel one of the Arrowverse shows and replace it with a live action Titans show, since they can't really do an official Justice League, all the members of the Justice Society are either in different time periods or dead (unless they just use the name), and Young Justice is getting a 3rd season so a live action show really isn't necessary.

1.) Would you do it?

2.) If so, what show will you cancel?

3.) Who will make up your Titans team? And why?

(They do not need to be the characters from the animated show. Between 5-7 members. I would prefer it if all of your picks were members of either Teen Titans or Titans at some point in the comics.)

Here's my answers in order:

1.) Yes

2.) I will cancel Arrow, because I do not watch it, therefore I have no emotional connection to it.

3.) My team would be 7 members. They are: (1) Dick Grayson/Nightwing (Because they've been teasing us, and no one likes a tease), (2) Wally West/Kid Flash (Because he will be given more of a chance to shine on a team, in comparison to a show that is primarily focused on one specific character.), (3) Thea Queen/Speedy (Technically, Thea wasn't a part of the team but her comic book ""counterpart"" Mia Dearden was, and this way at least one character from the cancelled show still sticks around,) (4) Starfire (Pretty much because I feel like you can't have a Titans team with Nightwing without her, and I really like her), (5) Kyle Rayner/Green Lantern (He's my favorite lantern, and I want to see him in more stuff.), (6) Raven (I want a magical member on the team.), and (7) Rose Wilson/Ravager (Deathstroke's daughter. Need I say more.)",Arrowverse,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrowverse/comments/61x04p/live_action_titans/,,[deleted],61x04p,/r/Arrowverse/comments/61x04p/live_action_titans/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrowverse/comments/61x04p/live_action_titans/,8,2017-03-28

DISCUSSION: Another quick question; Would it be absurd to..,"The other day I posted a question on here 'Would you prefer a live-action Martian Manhunter (&amp; Ms Martian) OR Supergirl?' because, as I said in that post, out of boredom I'm writing my own DC movie type of things.. idk.

So, new question. My Superman sequel takes place directly before Justice League. Would it be absurd to have it lead directly in, as in, in the movie I introduce Martian Manhunter, the villain is Brainiac who would work well as a villain in a JL movie as well.

*My idea is to do a time travel type of thing. Throughout the movie Supes would be against teaming up with anyone because he doesn't think he needs the help, to keep others who are willing to help him out of danger. Martian Manhunter arrives on Earth to warn us about Brainiac who has devastated Mars and is coming for Earth. Brainiac would have an army of robots, ya know, Chitauri-like cannon fodder for a team up movie.*

*It would end with Brainiac blowing up the sun, and creating a black hole, Superman chasing after the missile would accidentally go into the black hole and go back in time (no spinning the Earth around or whatever) to when MM arrived, before Brainiac even invaded. He's been given a second chance, and since he couldn't defeat Brainiac alone (the fckin sun blew up), he's now willing to admit that he needs help. And that is where the Superman sequel would end and JL would pick up. He has maybe a day to form the Justice League before Brainiac arrives. It adds a cool, clairvoyant effect to the viewer (Edge Of Tomorrow style) and a ticking clock to form the League (of Supes, Bats, WW, Jessica Cruz GL, The Flash and MM) therefore making it more intense of a build up.* 

The reason I say it's absurd is because that would be a cliffhanger and a half, the world literally blew up along with the rest of the solar system, in a Superman movie.. WHAT!? And people who watch only the Justice League movie might be lost at points. It's only a basic concept, I've really just rambled on a whole bunch. I think it would work well as a comic or cartoon or something but maybe not a movie. :/

OTHER: Justice League Unlimited Intro + JL Trailer. Request.,"So yesterday, I had the idea to sync up the JL intros with the official JL trailer. In my opinion, the JL animated series trailers didn't fit the JL trailer, but the JL Unlimited trailer fit very well especially if you set the intro to play from the 1:22 mark in the official trailer.

A North Carolina man was sentenced to nine months in prison Monday for his part in an attempt to violently overthrow the West African government of Gambia,"This is an automatic summary, [original](http://www.guns.com/2017/03/27/north-carolina-man-sold-guns-to-overthrow-african-government/) reduced by 53%.
*****
&gt; A North Carolina man was sentenced to nine months in prison Monday for his part in an attempt to violently overthrow the West African government of Gambia, the Justice Department announced.

&gt; Alhaji Boye, 46, was one of several Gambian-American citizens who joined a political group called The Gambia Freedom League, which seeks regime change in that country.

&gt; The group sought to overthrow Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, who has ruled the country since his nonviolent coup in 1994, officials said.

&gt; Two days later, Boye bought two AK-47 rifles and 7,000 rounds of ammunition.

&gt; About a week later, Boye bought four Diamondback rifles.

&gt; The DOJ said that the FBI traveled to Gambia in early 2015 to inventory and photograph the 35 firearms seized by the Gambian government - five of them were purchased by Boye.

option 1, in the event superman does comeback and DC/WB wants a seventh hero, Shazam is makes more sense than GL cause Shazam's movie is coming up sooner than GL 

option 2, marketing was just pulling us superman is still somewhat dead but we get shazam and GL before getting supes back

Kid friendly Green Lantern comics?,"Hi all,

I ""accidentally"" got my 5yr old nephew super into Green Lantern (long story) and I would love to pick him up some GL comics for his Bday coming up. However, where he is still rather young and has a heavily conservative mother I'm worried about grabbing inappropriate comics for him.
Is there a line of non-Justice League-esque Green Lantern centered comics that you guys think would be good for him?

He does this in Watchmen, Man of Steel ( certain scenes), BVS, 300, and now again in Justice League. 

I was like wow it's...blue again? So I was wondering are his lighting techniques something that the more knowledgeable and dedicated movie buffs approve of? why is it bad/good in your opinion?

4chan Justice League leak,"&gt;An alliance between humans, amazons and atlanteans repels Darkseid's invasion and three Mother Boxes are left behind and split between them.

&gt;On present day, Batman and Wonder Woman are assembling a group of meta-humans to defend Earth from an extraterrestrial threat summoned by Lex Luthor's experiments with Kryptonian technology. Aquaman and Cyborg decline their offer, while the Flash accepts.

&gt;Parademons kidnap several scientists, including Cyborg's father, and Cyborg joins the team to rescue them. Aided by Commissioner James Gordon, they locate the Parademons' nest in an underground tunnel connecting Metropolis and Gotham, but are ambushed and nearly killed before Aquaman rescues them and they save the scientists.

&gt;Steppenwolf arrives on Earth and steals Themyscira's Mother Box. The heroes attempt to stop him from stealing Atlantis' Mother Box but fail and decide to go their separated ways. Steppenwolf also decides to revive and brainwash Superman to serve him.

&gt;Steppenwolf uses the Mother Boxes to open a portal and bring an army of Parademons to subjugate Earth. Batman convinces the heroes to come together again and they face Steppenwolf and his forces in Metropolis. During the battle, the heroes manage to free Superman of Steppenwolf's influence and he joins them.

&gt;The heroes defeat Steppenwolf, while Cyborg, who is connected to the Mother Boxes, manages to reverse the portal and send the invading army back to Apokolips. The heroes then form the Justice League to keep defending Earth against extraordinary threats.

&gt;Darkseid is alerted that Earth managed to repel his invasion again and decides to attack them directly.

&gt;Alfred Pennyworth joins the final battle piloting the team's aircraft.

&gt;Lex Luthor is locked up at Arkham Asylum but manages to secure his release.

&gt;Lois Lane, Jonathan and Martha Kent, Hyppolita, Mera, Vulko, Iris West, Henry Allen, Silas Stone and Abin Sur make appearances in the movie.

&gt;Superman spends most of the movie in a Purgatory-like state modeled after Kent Farm where he interacts with the ghost of Jonathan Kent.

&gt;Batman has prophetic dreams for reasons not entirely explained. Something about ""fate"" choosing an oracle to herald a new age of heroes, according to Wonder Woman.

&gt;Lois is used to bring Superman out of his brainwashed trance.

&gt;Martha appears on Purgatory and has a minor scene in the real world.

&gt;Henry has one scene.

&gt;Iris is a quirky intern reporter trolling the CCPD for scoops. Barry has a crush on her but is too beta to make a move. Bruce helps him in the end.

&gt;Abin Sur appears during the opening battle helping fend off Darkseid's invasion.

&gt;Mera is the captain of Atlantis Royal Guard and doesn't even like Aquaman yet. He's just risen to the throne.

&gt;Vulko is an Atlantean elder and the guardian of their Mother Box.

&gt;Jokes are hit and miss, especially Barry's.

&gt;Running time is roughly 181 minutes long.

Discussion: Justice League's Secret Character,"We all know that Humans, Atlanteans and Amazons fight together to defeat Darkseid's army in act 1. There is a major character here from dc comics who i think has already been casted in the movie and joins the fight against Darkseid with the combined army. She is Kara Zor El (Supergirl), who will help to defeat Darkseid's army.
This is definitely possible because we all know that in the 'Man of Steel Prequel Comic' Kara's scout ship crashes on earth. We see her leaving the scout ship.

This is the best way they can connect this storyline to DCEU. She will sacrifice herself to close the boom tubes on earth successfully only to be captured by Darkseid in act 1. She is imprisoned in a suspended animation.

It is ironic that another kryptonian in present (superman) will defeat darkseid's army in final act. This is why Darkseid hates kryptonians.

I think Darkseid will use her as a weapon to fight league in a future justice league movie.",DC_Cinematic,14,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/6283jl/discussion_justice_leagues_secret_character/,DISCUSSION,ViolatingNDANOT,6283jl,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/6283jl/discussion_justice_leagues_secret_character/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/6283jl/discussion_justice_leagues_secret_character/,27,2017-03-29

CRUMDUM - SUMMER MOVIE DRAFT 2017 PREVIEW,"**CRUMDUM - SUMMER '17 PREVIEW**

&amp;nbsp;

Buckle up Movie Draft fans--as we look ahead to how the Summer Movie Draft will play out, we suspect we'll all be witnesses to history, with FOUR teams finishing within $15 million of each other. Only three times in the last five seasons have any TWO teams finished that close in the standings. It will be a drama-filled season forcing us to the edge of our seats, the slightest deviation from our projections resulting in teams leapfrogging each other in the spirited battle for... third place.

Okay, maybe even second, as we have that team finishing only another $50 million ahead. But while five teams battle for silver, we think the path to gold is clear for Team DTNS as they avenge consecutive runner-up finishes.

While we admit that some^1 of our preseason predictions are based primarily on ""a vibe"" or ""our gut"" or ""an embarrassing lack of research"" and that it is possible a fair percentage of us still aren't convinced *Valerian* isn't a variety of orange, this in no way diminishes our confidence in having identified the EXACT number of teams participating in the Summer Movie Draft.

Will all of our individual movie projections be right on the money? No, of course not^2 (when William Goldman said ""nobody knows anything,"" he may have been referring to all of Hollywood, but he was certainly reading a CRUMDUM at the time).

Will we have any single projection come within 25% of the total box office for any one of the thirty films? It's not definite, but is possible, if you put any stock in the Blind Squirrel Theory.

Will we at least spell every team's name correctly in each issue? Unlikely, but we refuse to take all the blame when autocorrect changes DTNS to Donuts.^3

So what makes us worthy of making projections at all? Simple--when you try to do something that nobody does well, you don't feel so bad about failing. Like a straight guy hitting on girls in a lesbian bar--of course you're going to strike out, but who the hell expected any different? Depending on how oafish your friends are, you may even garner a sliver of respect for making such a bold play. And should you luck into that thousand-to-one shot when Mary just had a really big fight with her girlfriend and she thinks going home with you (and making damned sure Anita knows about it) would be the best way to show Anita how pissed she is--then everyone thinks you're a god!^4

It is with that never-say-die mindset that we offer our predictions for the 2017 Summer Movie Draft...

&amp;nbsp;

**6th Place - Frogpants - $615M**

(*Motto: ""Stop messing with my head!""*)

Brian and Scott were busy on draft night, nabbing a league-leading seven movies. Unfortunately, more movies means more things for us to be uncertain about. So mostly out of spite for making us feel stupid, we say they'll finish in sixth place, knowing full well that we could regret it.

While not a Winter Movie Draft Brushwoodian nine, seven movies does provide Frogpants with a substantial pool of breakout potential capable of lifting them much higher in the standings. In fact, the breakouts may have already begun with Power Rangers' $40M opening weekend putting it on track to well exceed our meh projection of $80M.

There is also a non-zero chance that mother-daughter comedy *Snatched*--buoyed by cleverly opening on Mother's Day weekend--does not perform as dismally as we expect ($60M), despite being headlined by the niece or cousin or something of U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer. Must be nice having powerful relatives. We suppose Ivanka Trump would be filming the new Lara Croft movie if she wasn't busy running the country.

And would anyone be stunned if the Christopher Nolan-helmed *Dunkirk* did *Saving Private Ryan* numbers and nearly doubled our predicted $120M?

Which is all to say you have to make your worst prediction sometime.

&amp;nbsp;

**5th Place - Night Attack - $620M**

(*Motto: ""True story... No lie...""*)

On the bright side for Brian and Justin, they won't have to endure the stress of last summer's nailbiting finish. They'll spend some time on top of the heap with possibly the season's biggest movie in *Guardians of the Galaxy 2*, however Groot and the Gang may have trouble matching the original's $333M. Last time, it opened in late summer with little blockbuster competition, while this time it opens in early May, pitting it against behemoths like *King Arthur, Snatched*, and *Baywatch*... fine, it makes its $333M.

*Breaking: Night Attack motto change--""You can't get an infection in your bootyhole.""*

And sure, *Guardians* doesn't have to do it alone, as Justin and Brian have *Pirates of the Caribbean* chipping in. Of course, this would be a more impressive get if it was 2006; the *Pirates* franchise is currently on shakier ground than a Johnny Depp marriage, having plunged from $423M to $309M to $241M. On the other hand--ghost sharks! So let's say $225M.

Toss in *Girls Trip* and the stars of *Prison Logic*^5 are looking at $620M--a fine Movie Draft season if you can overlook the niggling detail of finishing in fifth place.

**4th Place - Cordkillers - $625M**

(*Motto: ""Spend the money... spend the money...""*)

If not for the vagaries of the auction leaving them a single dollar shy of adding the draft's final movie (*Valerian*) to their slate, we'd slot Cordkillers in second place with $700M.

That result is still not out of the question as Kristi and Mulango go back to the Minions well that treated them so extravagantly in their championship Summer 2015 season, hitching their 2017 hopes to *Despicable Me 3*--a good bet, assuming Minion fatigue hasn't set in. Ha! Yeah, count out all the eight-year-olds whining, ""Mother, I find I am wearying of the yellow, capsule-shaped characters with the funny voices who laugh at each others' misfortune. Is there no Fellini retrospective currently playing in the area?""

So Kristi and Mulango are going to make some money. And if *The House* follows in the footsteps of Ferrell's *Daddy's Home* ($150M) rather than our stopping at our anticipated $100M, Cordkillers could easily find themselves battling for second rather than scrambling to avoid second-to-last.

**3rd Place - ScotchBros - $630M**

(*Motto: Have any of you checked the box office?*)

While third place and a spot on the medal stand would be a fine showing, Jason and Cargill could improve on that if *CHiPS* soars, fueled by the moviegoing public bearing out Jason's draft night proclamation that ""ass-eating jokes are where it's at in 2017!"" given that those jokes made up approximately 97% of the trailer. But then how many times have we all been disappointed in a movie and lamented ""they used up all the good ass-eating jokes in the trailer""?

(*Editor's note: An opening weekend $7.6M indicates a stunning lack of appreciation for the revered ass-eating bon mots, their popularity having apparently peaked sometime mid-draft*).

*Baywatch* could be a sneaky overperformer as, *CHiPs* notwithstanding, raunchy summer comedies are often a good bet, and the trailer had surprisingly more laughs than expected.^6

We also expect *Transformers: About Last Knight* to challenge *Planet of the Apes* for the second-best buy of the draft behind *Atomic Blonde* (that's right--Atomic. Blonde.), but countering that is our casually-watched-one-trailer impression that *Valerian* is this year's *Jupiter Ascending*.

Which all adds up to third place, bitch.

**2nd Place - Big &amp; Tall - $680M**

(*Motto: ""Loyalty to '70s cop shows doesn't win you a Movie Draft.""*)

Patrick and Father Robert are already winners, having resisted the oh-so-alluring siren song of *CHiPs*, considering Patrick's personal ties to the franchise.

As previously mentioned, we see *Planet of the Apes* as a top-three value, earning nearly $10M per budget dollar at $225M. An *Avengers* bounce pulls *Spider-Man* at least $75M above it's recent $200M plateau. *Boss Baby* takes in $100M after beating the *Smurfs* into submission and cruising unopposed for kids mindshare for two months until *Captain Underpants* shows up to fight for truth, justice, and the tighty-whitey way.

That leaves *Rough Night*, and if it can prove to be *The Hangover* Lite and bring in $140M, they could be in striking distance of a championship given just a single stumble by our projected champion, a team you may know as...

**1st Place - DTNS - $810M**

(*Motto: ""Spend your money, Cordkillers!""*)

It's been a year of fantasy movie heartbreak for Tom and Jennie.^7 Last summer saw them fall a mere $3M shy of winning the title in the closest Movie Draft ever. Then, after being favored to win the followup Winter Draft, they repeated their second place finish, though this time the deficit was a couple orders of magnitude larger at $300M.

So what's different this time?

Everyone says *Wonder Woman* was the best part of *Batman v Superman*. Everyone thinks *Wonder Woman* is the movie that breaks the DC curse. If so, Tom and Jennie will cash in about $300M and be almost impossible to stop, considering that comes on top of a probable $350M from *Fate of the Furious* (there is currently no combination of Hollywood insiders, computers, and witches that can explain how the seventh installment of a franchise can be its highest grossing--by *$115 million dollars!*). 

If, on the other hand, June 2 finds us all shaking our heads and muttering, ""Damn it, DC, when are you going to stop being so DC?,"" then this race suddenly becomes a lot more interesting. Well, a little more interesting. DTNS will still have the league's best value movie in *Atomic Blonde* (you thought we were kidding, didn't you?) plus epic-franchise-in-the-making *Captain Underpants* (there is so much buzz around this new superhero that Marvel is hoping to acquire it with the long term plan of teaming Jessica Jones, Daredevil, and Luke Cage as elderly crime fighters, led by Captain Underpants, in *The Dependers*).

So congratulations, DTNS! We don't see how you can possibly lose. We are so confident that Tom and Jennie will wear the crown, we laugh at the fact that three of the past four consensus picks to win did not, if you want to be technical, win.

&amp;nbsp;

**CRUMDUM Bonus Feature:** Here's a clip from the 1969 Winter Movie Draft. While the reel-to-reel tape is not particularly clear, we believe it captures the fathers of C Robert Cargill and Jason Murphy, who teamed to form TomCollinsBros...

""And with a winning bid of ten dollars, the movie goes to TomCollinsBros!""

""Yeah! *Goodbye Mr. Chips*, bitch!""

&amp;nbsp;

^1 Most.

^2 Why start now?

^3 Proofreading is for suckers.

^4 Nobody has to know that Mary explicitly told you that her ploy will be particularly effective because even if she was straight she'd have to be crazy desperate and even crazier drunk to normally even be seen with you.

^5 ""Stars"" may be overstating a tiny bit. Do the leads normally have a six hour shooting schedule?

^6 Zero. We expected zero.

^7 You may think ""heartbreak"" is way too strong an emotion for a movie game. You are wrong.

DISCUSSION: How would you outline the JL movie?,"1. Prologue. We see the original Age of Heroes (humanity uniting with Themyscira and Atlantis to fend off Darkseid's forces).

2. Recruitment. Bruce tries to go recruit Arthur. He says no. He returns to the Batcave, and Diana meets him there. They discuss recruiting the other two (Barry and Victor). Diana agrees to go after Victor, while Bruce says he'll go find Barry. Victor turns Diana down, but Barry says yes to Bruce (much to his surprise). They decide to go meet with Gordon to get some more intel on what's going on with the Parademon nest beneath Gotham. We also get some scenes in there of Arthur and Victor rethinking their decision to turn down the offer. When the meeting with Gordon finally happens, we see that Arthur and Victor are firmly on board. Then you get the action set piece in Gotham's tunnels.

3. Struggles. The team struggles to come together as a cohesive unit. And what's worse is that they learn that the leader of this Parademon army -- Steppenwolf -- will arrive on Earth at any minute. He's looking for the Motherboxes so they can turn Earth into another satellite of Darkseid's empire.

4. ""For The Man Who Has Everything."" In this sequence, we get a glimpse of what Superman's consciousness is experiencing while in his comatose state. This is where we see him in the black suit. He imagines his ""ideal"" life on Krypton, his ""ideal"" life in Smallville, and finally his TRUE ideal life in Metropolis (as Superman). this is where Clark learns that he truly loves being Superman.

5. Steppenwolf. Steppenwolf arrives and begins collecting the Motherboxes. The team realizes that they can't win this war without Superman. Batman goes to visit Lex to see if there is any way to bring him back. Lex agrees to give him the knowledge that he needs on the condition that he be released from Arkham. Batman agrees.

6. Resurrection. As the team attempts to hold off Steppenwolf, Batman (or whoever) works to bring Superman back to life. They take his body to the scout ship and do whatever Lex told them needed to be done to bring him back. Superman returns.

7. Justice League. The united Justice League works together to destroy Steppenwolf. Following the battle, Superman is formally introduced to his new teammates. Maybe they enjoy a home-cooked meal at the Kent farm.

8. Epilogue. The team goes their separate ways. Batman returns to Gotham. Superman returns to Lois in Metropolis. Lois writes an article about how the world has changed since Superman's arrival, and how we're now living in a new Age of Heroes. The film ends with the world embracing not only Superman, but his new friends as well. During this final montage, we hear the words of Jor-El from Man of Steel. ""You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun, Kal. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.""

9. Stinger. Abin Sur's ship crash lands on Earth.

PODCAST: Man of Steel Minute 48 w/ Sam Otten,"Today we're discussing the concept of the Randian hero and how it applies to superheroes. We talk about Superman's values and how perhaps the theme of this film is not ""Hope"", but really ""Choice"". It brings Sam into this revelation that, for those that want to demand superman act a certain way is to take away the freedom that makes him great. What are your thoughts?

[Listen in on our discussion of Minute 48 of Man of Steel here](http://traffic.libsyn.com/dccinematicminute/MoS-E-048.mp3)

Synopsis: Jor-El explains to Kal-El that, by being the first naturally born Kryptonian in centuries, he is the embodiment of choice; perhaps the greatest value of Superman.

About us: DC Cinematic Minute is daily podcast doing a deep dive of the DCEU starting with Man of Steel. In this podcast, we've chopped up the film into individual minutes and each day we discuss and analyze everything what happens within that certain minute. The format is similar to Star Wars Minute. We're really passionate about the DC Universe, so this method allows us to explore the mythos of Superman and really pick apart the inner workings of the film franchise. Following Man of Steel, we'll be giving the same treatment and study to the extended cuts of BvS, Suicide Squad, and so on.

"Still don't know what I'm looking for, just felt right about posting this here","I was recommended this sub from over at /stopdrinking. I don't know how else to start this other than my SO that I was with for 10 years died today. Non-stop drinking for the last 3 years and constant warnings from doctors about how his liver was failing led to pancreatitis which then led to his kidneys failing. 

I think I'm still trying to figure out how I feel. TBH I was looking for a way out since Xmas after he took the Xmas money I was saving for our son to buy more wine/vodka. He wasn't the person I married, he was just consumed, nothing mattered anymore. But I'm still left feeling sad. Just utterly sad, but I'm fine 80% of the time. Stupid things like having the Justice League trailer show up on my YouTube feed knowing he was excited about it. Just stupid small insignificant things. 

I think I came here to see if there are others who are or have experienced something like this.

My Fantasy Sinister Six!,"When I was a kid, Spider-Man was my favorite hero! Not just because he was awesome, but also because he had some fun, badass villians. After reading [this bit](http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/03/27/sneak-peek-michael-keaton-is-vulture-in-spider-man-homecoming/99534662/) about the Vulture and his motivations, it really got my gears turning as to what other villians we may see in future MCU Spider-Man films  *(Assuming Sony doesn't fuck it all up)*.  And additionally, how could their motivations or tech be intertwined with the nearly decade long running MCU?

So just for fun, here's my fantasy Sinister Six lineup! This list is based on my own personal set of 3 rules:

* The villians, their back stories, and their abilities have to fit the street-level tone of the MCU in its current state. *(So no Morbius or Hydro-Man)*
*  A Sinister Six stand-off would happen in the third Spider-Man film, after we've had more screen time to get attached to Peter and to build up his Rogues Gallery.
* Lastly, only villians previously unseen on the big screen are considered, with the exception of Harry and Norman Osborn and since we were cheated out of a good fight in ASM2, Rhino. *(Thats right. No Doc Ock or even Venom. Before you get the torches, hear me out...)*

##My Fantasy Sinister Six
6. **Vulture** - Let's start with the obvious. Michael Keaton is going to be an awesome Adrian Toomes, and considering his place in the MCU and in the comics as one of Spidey's 1st real baddies, I'd say its not too far off to place him as a possible candidate as the leader of The Six.

5. **Shocker** - Also joining the MCU is Bokeem Woodbine as the one and only Shocker. As one of the original members in the comics, I had always hoped we'd see Electro as a possibility, but given the similarity to The Shocker and Jamie Foxx's bizarre performance in ASM2, it ain't happening folks! As seen in the most recent Homecoming trailer, The Shocker appears to be using a modified version of Rumlow's gauntlets from Civil War, which makes for a really cool tie in with past films.

4. **Rhino** - The Avengers have Hulk. The X-Men have Colossus. And the Justice League have Superman. Every group needs a tank, and for that reason alone I'm throwing Aleksei Sytsevich on this list. Well, that and the fact that the last Spider-Man film blued-balled us into thinking we'd get a badass Spidey vs. Rhino showdown. One thing that film did get right in my opinion was going the armored suit route instead of the strength augmenting super skin. Maybe with the help of the already established Tinkerer he could don some modified version of the Iron Monger suit? Or maybe some salvaged Stark armor from IM3? As far as casting goes, I'd love to see what [John Cena](http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/11700000/cena-john-cena-11761809-377-471.jpg) could do with the role.

3. **Chameleon** - The MCU has done a great job of using elements of espionage in their films so why stop now! In my ideal version of The Six, I imagine ex-KGB Dmitri Smerdyakov would join up as a hired thug of sorts. This dude is a master of disguise and brilliant actor, couple that with whatever face-changing tech Romanov uses in Winter Soldier and you've got a formidable addition to the Sinister Six. When I think of master manipulator I think of [Aiden Gillen](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/xof1013/1759099/81641/81641_original.jpg). If you're a Game of Thrones fan, you'll understand.

2. **Kraven the Hunter** - Here's where things get fun! As half-brother to Dmitri aka Chameleon, the pair would bring an interesting brotherly dynamic to the group. Not only that, but Kraven is an original member of the Six in the comics, and also considered to be one of Spidey's most badass villians! It would be a shame to see Chameleon imprisoned or even killed, sending this master hunter/tracker into an unstoppable mission for revenge... I'm going with another Game of Thrones alumni and fan casting [Pedro Pascal](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d0/59/9f/d0599f1fa6aaed23d5eace1b10b5b10b.jpg) as the Hunter. This dude definitely has the looks and possess the acting chops to become one of Spidey's best on screen villians.

1. **Hobgoblin** - Faced with pressure to renew the Spider-Man/Green Goblin rivalry but not wanting to resort to old tricks, writer Roger Stern created Hobgoblin as a new goblin-themed villain for Spidey’s rogues gallery. We've already had Greengoblin on the big screen 3 times, but creating a Spider-Man universe without Greengoblin would be like creating a Batman universe without The Joker. While neither Norman or Harry wore the mantel of Hobgoblin in the comics, what better way to shake things up like Stern did than to introduce Hobgoblin to audiences. My hope would be that the source of conflict between the Osborns gets established in the 2nd MCU Spider-Man film and either Harry or Norman are the initial founders of the Sinister Six. Both of these characters have been fan-casted to death on this subreddit, but my picks are [Asa Butterfield](http://cdn2-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/a-brilliant-young-mind/abym2.jpg) as Harry and [Jude Law](http://samtaylorjohnson.com/media/jude_law_for_paradise_magazine_2008-567x568.jpg) as Norman. I could write an entirely separate post as to why these two would be my ideal picks...

##Honorable Mentions
* Scorpion - I feel like this group can only have so many animal themed guys in it...
* Beetle - How cool would it be for him to rock some modified version of the Yellowjacket suit?!
* Mysterio - I love this guy and *totally* want to see him realized, maybe in the 2nd Spider-Man film, but I opted for Chameleon in this list due to his ties to Kraven.
* J. Jonah Jameson - HE'S A MENACE
* Carnage - It would have to be an R-rated film to be right, and that ain't gonna happen!

DISCUSSION: JL will be rated fresh if it is good.,"A lot of people here seem to believe that critics for some reason hate Zack Snyder. There are many people here who think no matter what, JL will be trashed regardless of the quality of the film.

I disagree. Critics gave the theatrical cut a bad rating because of reasons you already know. That version isn't even the best version of this film. The Ultimate Edition is far better. All JL needs to do is avoid the TC mistakes. Keep the plot linear, with well written dialogues and performances, the movie will then be rated above 70%. I **have** the confidence that they're doing exactly that. There probably won't be so many dream sequences, or knightmare scenes or, any Martha moment in this film. 

Warner Bros seems to have repented over the last year. WW can be the **""rising like a phoenix out of the ashes""** moment for the DCEU. I have a feeling that this film will be good. That will turn the conversation into a more positive way for the DCEU. It will also help JL's box office. Critics will praise that film. It will bring good PR. That is enough to turn the conversation. 

Sure, there will always be hate-spewing bloggers. But the critics **want to like** Justice League. They are just like you and me, who want to love these films. Iron fist receiving 17% on RT (the show is really bad btw) is proof that critics don't have any bias towards one company or another.

I think Zack Snyder could and will surprise us by delivering a fresh rated film this time. Maybe third time is the charm.",DC_Cinematic,2,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/62690i/discussion_jl_will_be_rated_fresh_if_it_is_good/,DISCUSSION,emeraldknight5,62690i,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/62690i/discussion_jl_will_be_rated_fresh_if_it_is_good/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/62690i/discussion_jl_will_be_rated_fresh_if_it_is_good/,36,2017-03-29

Stephen King-verse,"With It and the Dark Tower both coming out soon and getting a good bit of hype, does anyone think that there could be a shared Stephen King universe?


I know most people are getting tired of shared movie universes, but Stephen Kings books are usually very connected. They may not be intertwined like the Avengers or Justice League, but the books have a lot of nods to other books and the Dark Tower series brings in a lot from other books. 

Any thoughts on a slightly connected Stephen King Universe?",movies,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6287gc/stephen_kingverse/,,GomuGomu_no_Keyblade,6287gc,/r/movies/comments/6287gc/stephen_kingverse/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6287gc/stephen_kingverse/,10,2017-03-29

Batman in BvS had dreams of Parademons because Flashpoint has already happened,"This is a very loose thought so please help out in the comments to make this a full theory.  So Batman has those bizarre dream sequences in Batman V Superman and they never seem to make much sense.  Why would Batman dream about Darkseid and Parademons before ever seeing them in real life?

Well the Justice League trailer reveals that the Parademons will be fighting the league and this should be the first time Batman has encountered them.  But Batman has already been dreaming about them.

What if this current timeline in the DCEU is the altered timeline?  What if some sort of Flashpoint event has already happened and Batman was heavily involved, leaving subdued memories that resurface as dreams?  Batman was changed into a murdering, branding force due to his experience in the original timeline.

Just some thoughts with no real connections.

What games will we 'never see the likes of again?',"Mine would be Freedom Force and Freedom Force vs The Third Reich. 

I doubt anyone will every make such a customizable superhero game where you can be whatever you want. The closest are the various MMO's which scratch a different itch and are still very limited in terms of powers. 

At some point I had like 2000 characters in Freedom Force, and enough amazing mods that I could just set up AI battles between the Justice League and the Avengers and sit back and watch as they leveled a city and as Superman and either The Hulk or Thor where left bashing each other into buildings while all their friends lay unconscious.

This thread is open to Pull List posters and all members of the /r/comicbooks community to share your thoughts on the debut issue of Guggenheim, Bunn, Pak, Lashley, Kirk, and Roberson's *X-Men: Prime* or any new books shipping this week.

The primary intention of this thread is to promote discussion of new books. It also serves as a way to consolidate discussion to a single thread and talk about what books are popular here on /r/comicbooks. That does not mean other threads aren't welcome, this is just a place to start that's easy to find each week.

The thread is populated with comments meant to direct the discussion of each book. Based on a recent community decision we're expanding the Top Ten and populated the thread with titles appearing on Ten Percent or more of submitted pull lists. If a title you want to talk about is not listed, simply add a comment with the title and issue number first and comment below. There is also a comment dedicated to the discussion of WPL results linked above.

**Spoilers will follow**, but there's no harm in tagging them as such.  Each title in the Top Ten listed below is linked directly to its corresponding comments to avoid seeing details from other books. The post has also been placed in ""contest mode"" to help readers avoid spoilers while browsing.

r/movies commentator says that the Asian-American experience is not as plot worthy as the African-American experience,"original comment:
&gt;Well look at your break down.  
5% asian population.  
Then remember that unlike black, the asian population is further split between middle eastern, chinese, japanese, Thai, korean....etc.  
So the people most affected are a much smaller minority.  
I'm black and while I can understand, I'm still waiting for a black Avenger who isn't a Dark Iron man or a Black Justice League member whose not 90% CGI.  

&gt;Next you have Hong Kong and Japanese Cinema. So there's that representation that some people can go ""Good enough"".
Stories about the asian american experience? Could be seen not as plot worthy as the African American experience. You don't hear too many stories of racial profiling of Chinese/Japanese/Korean, because you damn well hear about middle eastern(which is why that topic is rising up).  

&gt;Finally and this is something I just haven't seen that foreign black actors can do. Accents. They can do american accents and thus they can do whatever role they wish in the US. Asian actors generally don't demonstrate that capability. It's never surprising to me that a chinese actor is given a small role. They don't have a grasp of english and so you can't shoot a film with that. &amp;nbsp;

New gods in season 3: apokolips,"And now we look to the main villains of the s3 and that is the new gods of apokolips. 

Ruled by darkseid with an iron fist . apokolips is home to some of the most vile and dangerous villains earth heroes has ever encountered and with their sights set on earth they shall be the teams greatest adversaries. 

i will cover the two main groups Of apokolips that usually make up new god villain story arcs and will likely make an appearance in season 3. 


**THE** **ELITES**: Darkseids highest advisers and the most important figures on apokolips, they will be behind the scenes scheming and on the front lines taking the heroes head on. We've already seen two of its members but there will still more we will see. 

**desaad**: no apokolips arc would be complete without the demented mad god scientist of darkside. We've already had an episode featuring his work on earth and the glimpse of him in season 2 finale so it's without saying we will see him again and what ever twisted and horrid abominations and weapons he's cooked up

**Granny** **Goodness**: advisor and mistress of the elite guard, Should we gain an appearance of the furies then its guaranteed GG will be there to watch the team fall to the might of the guard

**steppenwolf**: quite honestly I liked the post flashpoint version the most cause he has the perfect look of a war god. While I'm all for a show resembling classic looks, I hope whatever adaptation s3 has of him, we'll know right away this is a god of war 

**kanto**: again I'm hoping for a original look that says I'm the god of assassins cause I'm sorry the man looks like he's a bard at a medieval play. He's deadly of course but when you look at him you can help but not take him seriously 

**Virman** **vundabar**: I don't really know or care about him enough to complain about his out of place ancient attire but his character as a master strategist is spoken most clearly through his clothing. 

**Glorious** **Godfrey**: I confess to say it was only after the s2 finally was I aware he was a part of darkseids elite. Which makes his annoying , provocative and slanderous talks so much sense cause earth more easier to conquer if you have someone who manipulates the mind of the people. Placing trust in ones you shouldn't and placing suspicion on those who would protect you is a great insidious example of divide and conquer 

**Amazing** **Grace**: Godfreys sister adding her own unique brand of mind control would make unity and trust among the heroes and the nations of earth all the more difficult. I could see her placing herself as a trusted and good leader that on the outside is innocent but from the sides is driving a wedge between nations to weaken earth

**Doctor** **Bedlam**: a potential powerhouse with a cunning mind who although I'm not very familiar with , he is one of the darkseid elites most common members 

**Mantis**: a good deterrent against a superheroes teams energy users mantis would be an ideal warrior for frontline assaults against both earths armies and its heroes 

**kalibak**: lastly and not least darkseids most loyal offspring : kalibak. Vicious, powerful , ruthless and forever hoping to gain his fathers approval, Kalibak will usually be the first new god once the invasion of apokolips begins and s3 may be no different.


**THE** **FURIES**
The amazon brigade of apokolips, the elite guard, the champions of the arena: these are but many names of the furies and they will likely be who the team faces most. Though it's size and number have varied with each adaptation, I cover the core members who could  make an appearance in s3

**artemisz**: this goddess of the bow may show Artemis a thing or two about archery by being able to fire arrow nearly as fast as bullets and with godly accuracy 

**bernadeth**: primarily the brains behind the furies, desaads malicious sister will be there to come up with effective battle strategies that the other furious will execute swiftly and mercilessly and I'm sure she'll have a few nasty tricks up her slieve should combat prove necessary 

**Bloody** **Mary**: a deadly vampiric goddess will be idea for inducing both mind tricks on the team and up the scare factor when she drains them of either energy or well.........blood

**Gilotina**: a particularly dangerous member of the furious, who ever faces her will be hard pressed when her hand emit energy that can cut through nearly anything; even the invulnerable flesh of kryptonians

**Knockout**: as the name implies both a powerhouse and quite easy on the eyes it would be interesting to see her flirt with Connor as they fight so as to callback to them dating in the old comics

**lashina**: one of the most common furies featured. Lashina is as lethal as she is attractive. Though I'm not averse to the sexy image she portrays I hope that ,should she make an appearance, it is not over the top and we are remind that through her skills she has every reason to be part of the furies

**Mad** **Harriet**:if joker and Freddy Kruger a love child then it was be the goddess. Insanity on a divine scale toppled with a insatiable bloodlust that she satisfies with each swipe of her claws that is the sort of Harriet I hope to see in s3; the kind that makes the bat family count their blessings with joker

**Speed** **Queen**: an answer to earths speedsters. While I like her set up I found her use of roller skates to be as ridiculous as black racers skiis. So I hope that if they show her it's either through a creative set of gear or on her own feet to achieve super speed

**stompa**: I liked her s/b : [apocalypse adaptation](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/6/69/Stompa_SBA_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20110917103659) though it could have used more emphasis on her actual power. When this lady steps there will be earthquakes so hopefully in s3 she would be both a bruiser and an shockwave machine in equal measure 

lastly one I hope to see a new new god of apokolips who is a powerful god that may prove a valuable but dangerous ally for the team

**grail**: in post-flashpoint out of all of darkseids children , grayven was the most similar to darkside in terms of [powers](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/6/67/Grayven_003.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110103065011), [looks](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/1/1d/Grayven_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141119214115) and [mindset](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/2/28/Grayven_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141119214240) who used any advantage he could find to overthrow his father and claim the throne of apokolips. In post-flashpoint(new52) grayven got , in my opinion , a new look like so many other characters 

A definite [genderbent](https://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11115/111158767/4538378-justice-league-40-2015-page-23-600x922.jpg),  [powerboosted](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/7/79/Grail_%28Prime_Earth%29_002.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150509022838),  [more-evil-than-though](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/4/41/Grail_Prime_Earth_0004.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151224003435) new52 version: [**Grail**](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/e/ef/Grail_Prime_Earth_003.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150604011346)

**Grail** was a much greater threat in the prime earth than her pre-53 male counterpart. Not interested in ruling apokolips but instead her life was dedicated to darkseids demise was no afraid to use any many necessary no matter how unsavory . I can see her as a tenuous ally that the team could get who would fit their group but there would be great distrust and disapproval in her methods. So if we are to get a dark ally for the team to defeat dark side I hope it to be the goddess of anti-life: grail",youngjustice,17,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/62f8gr/new_gods_in_season_3_apokolips/,,andih4ar1,62f8gr,/r/youngjustice/comments/62f8gr/new_gods_in_season_3_apokolips/,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngjustice/comments/62f8gr/new_gods_in_season_3_apokolips/,1,2017-03-30

I've seen all the shows and movies but I really want to get into the comics because that is why the shows and movies exist in the first place. My problem is I really don't know where to start. I am interested in the Justice League series as well as their individual series. I am very OCD and would go to great lengths such as reading from the very first comics (1930's-50's) just to get the full backstory. But thankfully I don't have to waste a lifetime on that because of D.C.'s reboots. My question is would starting at the New 52 give me the full backstory on these characters or is there some vital info missing? For example I know Barry Allen does but I don't know why he does and that's the type of info that I lack that makes me want to read from the very beginning back in the 1940's. Someone help me decide if the New 52 is the start for me to get the full backstory on these characters achievements.,DCcomics,6,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/62hhdc/where_do_i_start_reading_the_dc_comics/,,ActuallyYeezy,62hhdc,/r/DCcomics/comments/62hhdc/where_do_i_start_reading_the_dc_comics/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/62hhdc/where_do_i_start_reading_the_dc_comics/,17,2017-03-30

"DC Icons 6"" Action Figures Cancellations By DC Collectibles","For all the DC Action Figures collectors, Toy News International posted an update today from DC Collectibles on some cancellations for the DC Icons 6"" action figures. 

The line has been met with mixed criticism, mostly over sizing issues, not only height but body proportions of the figures not fitting well with the 7"" line, and even within the DC Icons 6"" line itself. The new Rebirth Justice League 7-pack set which was just released, is slightly larger than the DC Icons 6"" figures that came before it. There is also no word yet on the future of the line after the last 2-pack release of Superman vs Doomsday set for December. So, if you were planning on throwing out your 7"" figures to replace them with the new 6"" sizing, or hoping to build out a complete 6"" collection, the fate of the line is up in the air at this point.

Could X-men thrive as a comic book if it were more like justice league unlimited?,"Reading X-men Prime just made me realize how great this format could be. There's just so many X-men introduced over the years and so many throwaway (to me) mutants and marvel seems bent on pushing too many team books focusing on the same handful of characters, while at the same time so many iconic characters are gone now and there's kind of vacuum left behind...

It just makes me wonder what it would be like if they had a central book that could shine a spotlight on the mutants who have faded into the background over time. Write one or two issue story arcs with a new character/(temporary) team in the spotlight every time and also take some time to develop character drama at home and lay groundwork for bigger mysteries.

Instead we've got... 5? new team books coming and a handful of solo books? Well, hopefully the direction they're actually going in will stand strong on its own.",xmen,2,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/xmen/comments/62ezzx/could_xmen_thrive_as_a_comic_book_if_it_were_more/,,stowrag,62ezzx,/r/xmen/comments/62ezzx/could_xmen_thrive_as_a_comic_book_if_it_were_more/,https://www.reddit.com/r/xmen/comments/62ezzx/could_xmen_thrive_as_a_comic_book_if_it_were_more/,6,2017-03-30

M4F League of Legends (Or R34) pool party!,"**IF THIS IS STILL UP, I AM STILL LOOKING (AND REPLYING)**

Hi, I'm looking to do a pool party scene tonight! I've been feeling in a League of Legends mood as well, so I'm thinking maybe we can mix those two. 

The basic prompt, which is open to modification, is that when they're not fighting for the fields of Justice, champions have the opportunity to relax at this lavish mansion with their fellows. Of course there they can do as they please, and many of them take that occasion to fuck each other's brains out, sometimes in public, sometimes alone, but such a thing is accepted and encouraged.

You can use an original character, a celeb, cosplayer (with pool themed outfits :D) or whatever takes your fancy, I'd be happy to discuss your potential character(s) and mine. Pictures/gifs to enhance your description are a definite plus. Other R34 characters or settings are welcome as well :D

What I would like from you and what you can expect from me:

- I generally enjoy writing shorter replies of 1-2 paragraphs. I feel this provide more interaction and I am pretty fast paced in replying. If you are slower paced however, it doesn't bother me.

- I would like you to write in a good physical description of your outfit and your character, it helps my imagination. Pictures are a definite plus and I may offer some for inspiration, but I really like a well written physical description and I tend to deliver on that front.

Kinks: Non-con/dub-con, rough sex, dirty talk, degradation, me playing dominant, **clothed sex**, **sexy outfits**, history, gangbangs, **threesomes and group sex**, **celebs**, **free-use**, prostitution, ageplay, incest etc...

Looking forward to hearing from you!",dirtypenpals,2,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/62gsw8/m4f_league_of_legends_or_r34_pool_party/,,ThrowawaysAtTheGates,62gsw8,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/62gsw8/m4f_league_of_legends_or_r34_pool_party/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/62gsw8/m4f_league_of_legends_or_r34_pool_party/,0,2017-03-30
DISCUSSION: Can Deathstroke get his own solo movie?,"Pls?
No but for real, if everyone is getting solo movies, I think my son Slade Wilson deserves one. He has one of the most popular runs in Rebirth so far, so his fan base is definitely growing, he's going to have a small role in Justice League, maybe a bigger role in the Batman solo if Matt Reeves doesn't remove him entirely, and as a character he's definitely got more than enough stories to borrow from for his movie. His movie can also be an easter egg GOLDMINE, imagine him flipping through contracts and it's just a bunch of DC characters we all know and love, or something along those lines. The movie can also have tons of cameos from other characters from other movies in the DCEU, if done correctly. Of course, this will only happen once it makes sense too, as I wouldn't want a Deathstroke movie before the Flash or Man of Steel 2.

/u/KnsFizzioN on /r/leagueoflegends promises to eat three condoms if Team Roccat ends G2 Esports winning streak this weekend.,"**Original Post:** [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/62greq/g2_esports_vs_fnatic_eu_lcs_2017_spring_week_10/dfmj282/)

**Overview:** /u/KnsFizzioN has delivered a verbal agreement to ingest three (3) condoms if the European League of Legends Team ROCCAT should win their Best of 3 series against the currently unbeaten team G2 Esports. The games will start on saturday, at around 7pm UTC+2.

The endeavor shall be done while being streamed over a non-disclosed platform.

Circumstances point out that this is likely an attempt to bamboozle.

**Update:** Team Roccat has won the BO3 series with a 2-1 result. As it stands /u/KnsFizzioN has to stream his planned maneuver of ingesting three condoms. Let us hope this is no bamboozle.

**Update 2:** BAMBOOZLED! I was asleep while the bamboozle happened, and the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/62w498/as_promised_i_said_i_will_eat_3_condoms_on_stream/?sort=confidence) /u/KnsFizzioN posted his stream in has been [removed]. There's a major outcry for justice in the comments. And the mods have decided that bamboozle = banboozle. Someone else had done the correct thing and took a picture of the stream where he admitted to bamboozle. Thus he shall be introduced into the Basement of Bamboozlers.

You can see it [here](https://i.imgur.com/lzBMaUD.png).

This concludes my first bamboozle report.

[Spoilers] This season should've been season 4.,"Here's my what if story idea. Just sharing my ideas, please don't take it too seriously. I'm not a writer.

This is the direction the show should've taken after season 2:

So Slade is stuck on the island in the Argus prison. The prison we see him in is the 1.0 version of the prison. Argus will make it bigger and put all the villains Flash, Arrow etc. capture in it. So Slade will get company from all kinds of villains. 

The ending of season 2 had Sara rejoining the League. Season 3 starts off with Sara carrying out league missions. Thea is MIA and has told Oliver that she is traveling to see the world. So Oliver isn't suspecting a thing. She is with Merlyn. Laurel is working as the DA and we see her also in action in the courtroom. Trying to bring thugs to justice but seeing the system fail. 

The main plot for this arc is Sara and Oliver making a plan to infiltrate The League to take Ra's al Ghul out. There have been league members in Star City doing shady things within Star City businesses. The League is infiltrating into businesses to keep a grasp on economics. They even have agents working in governments and they destabilize countries and let markets collapse. So Oliver, who is working at Queen's Consolidated again, under the wing of Walter is trying to fight The League. 

Sara goes into deep cover but Ra's won't trust her because she left their side for a while. So Oliver and Sara will fake a falling out between them. Even Diggle and Felicity will be fooled by it. The viewer will also think that Sara and Oliver have problems. Sara works against Oliver to keep her cover up, but in secret she's trying to get close to Ra's. She never worked directly under him. She now has to keep this a secret from Nyssa too. So we get a nice suspenseful sideplot of Sara being a spy within the league. Having to carry out assassinations but struggling with it. Meanwhile Oliver is juggling his duties for Walter and being Green Arrow and fighting The League. Thea is still MIA.

Towards the midseason finale Sara's arc will get wrapped up for good. Ra's al Ghul figures out that she's working with Oliver. It seems like Ra's wants to kill Sara for her treason BUT someone else kills Sara: DAMIAN DARHK. But how?

Well, during Sara's investigations about Ra's she learns about Darhk. Darhk is about to do a coup and to take Ra's down. Darhk is alerted that Sara is onto him and he takes her out. Darhk is basically a captain in Ra's organisation. Oliver blames the league and Ra's for Sara's death and he's out for blood. He  goes to Ra's to fight him. 

Oliver fights Ra's on the mountain, like in the original. He falls and dies for real. Maseo, who we haven't seen in the present day storyline suddenly pops up as a surprise reveal and drags Oliver's body somewhere...... During this seasons flashbacks Oliver is still on the island. The island will be revealed as a hub for anything crazy in the DC universe. It seems that all kinds of people and things get attracted by the island. Oliver meets Maseo on the island. They are first enemies when they meet. The flashbacks still hasn't shown us their friendship that developed afterwards. So the viewer is surprised that Maseo is actually trying to save Oliver. 

After the midseason finale we learn about that. But Oliver will be brought back through a Lazerus Pit. Ra's will also be on a level that Oliver just can't reach. So Oliver won't be able to stop him. He's going to be someone he just can't kill. But the real season 3.5 villain will be Darhk. Darhk won't be magical at first but he'll obtain powers to be able to overthrow Ra's. The powers won't be OP though like in season 4. 

This will also cause an unlikely allience between Ra's and Oliver. So instead of Ra's and Oliver being against each other they make a deal. Take Darhk out and the League leaves Star City. 

In the end Darhk dies, Ra's leaves Star City and will develop an interesting respectful bond with Oliver. 

Laurel's arc will be the following: she keeps seeing the justice system  failing on her. Feels hopeless. Sara dies and the hopeless feeling gets stronger. She also learns about Oliver/Sara/BC etc. She decides at the end of the season to leave to learn about Sara's path. She'll meet her ''sensei'' and receive training. This season 3 shows us Laurel's beginning of becoming a hero. When she returns at the beginning of season 4 she'll have some skills but she isn't perfect yet. This is also when she gets her canary cry. This is how she'll get the cry: she gets a nemesis during her training. This villain will ''crush'' laurel. Laurel will be beaten and her throat will be cut. Laurel won't be able to speak anymore. Cisco however pulls through like always and engineers a ''canary cry''. They operate on her and they add this device that can make Laurel speak again BUT she can adapt the frequency and use a ''cry''. She'll look perfectly human, her powers would look like ''normal'' metahuman powers, but she secretly has cybernetic enhancements. After getting her cry she battles her nemesis again and WINS. But this happens in season 4. 

Back to season 3. Thea will be written out for almost the whole season. She'll be shows briefly during this whole season. She's training with Merlyn and being indoctrinated by him. She'll seriously love her father and learn a lot from him. She'll return as Artemis. A masked archer that Oliver fights a few times. But after her arc she'll be saved by Oliver and she'll turn into Speedy and becomes Oliver's sidekick. 
Diggle's story of the season: he struggles with his past in the army and his brothers death. He learns that an organisation called Hive framed and murdered him. Hive won't have anything to do with Darhk in this version of mine. Hive will be saved for season 4 with the prometheus storyline. Maybe hive in season 4.0 and prometheus in season 4.5. Diggle doesn't want to kill and is reluctant to go with Oliver into the field. But this one time Oliver gets injured and Diggle as to step in. Diggle saves him and Oliver calls Diggle his guardian, jokingly. This is how Diggle slowly becomes Guardian. Diggle will have James Olsen's badass suit and voice modulator and Shield. A shield and no gun because Diggle left the army killing days behind him. He struggles a lot with that and he vows to protect his brother: Oliver. Diggle won't always go into the field, only on special occasions. Oliver stays the main event. When Laurel becomes BS they will go out into the field side by side. Same with Speedy. But no big team. 

Felicity's arc: Not much room for her in my vision of the show. I'd only use her as comedic relief. Which she was good at in season 1. I'd bring her back to a season 1 status. 

So part 1: Sara infiltration arc. Oliver as the Green Arrow and working with Walter. Oliver vs. Ra's. Darhk kills Sara. Part 2: Laurel starts her journey. Oliver wants revenge. Oliver and Ra's work together. Lazarus Pit has side effects on Oliver. Battles the side effects in a flashbacky/dreamy episode. Darhk dies. Ra's lives. Merlyn and Thea are gone. Thea returns towards the end of the season as Artemis. Laurel leaves and goes on a journey. Returns beaten at the beginning of season 4, gets her cry. 

Season 4: Hive and Prometheus are the main villains.
Season 5: SUPERMAX. All the villains in the argus island prison will play a big part. Slade's return. Oliver gets a big arc on the island with all the former villains. Oliver vs. them all. And it ties back neatly with the flashbacks that all are on the island. This would also be the final season. Merlyn also returns in a big way this season.

- Where’s Eve? I still don’t understand what she wants from me.  
- Selena seemed to be a very nice person. But is she really a Gate Keeper? It’s hard for me to think that she’s the same kind of being as Beelzebub and Kuma.  
- Blue Cloud High School?! I heard they’re the joker card of this season. We can’t underestimate them. But, if given the chance, I’d like to play a match against them.

- No ice cream, no soccer. That’s how it is for me.  
- Usually when I say something like this, Noa comes running over and shoves something sweet in my mouth. What a convenient friend.

**Baltheon**  
 
- Nevantos is losing his mind. Will there be a way to cure him if we go to a place like Minerva?

- Revenge? Oh, I think about it every day. I only have something more urgent at the moment.

###Light:

- Vitos? You mean the emperor of Hellion? I've never met him before. Patricia? Who's that?  
- ...Vitos...Why can't I get that name off of my head?  
- Maybe it's because he's the one that rules Nebrion, a place that I have memories of...If it's not because of this, what else could there be?  
 
**Duke**  
 
- We stopped somebody's plan to turn the universe into chaos. But I have a feeling this isn't over yet.  
- No, that's not right. Nothing has ended since that day in Valhalla. It's all been ongoing for a very long time.  
- Yes, since that day when darkness fell upon us.  
- ...The true fight is not long ahead. At least that's what I believe.  
- That is why I am always sharpening my blade.

- I always told you that I need my two legs to be intact!  
- Let me go! I feel like a tied up piece of meat.  
- \*Flip\* \*Flip\*  
- Hey, this is actually fun. Maybe I could make this work.  
- \*Sigh\* I have to go find that freshman that went missing while following Milky Way...

###Thunder:  
 
**Askeladd**  
 
- Vann! Show them what you've got!

- I'm the only one left on the Resistance...So I was wondering...When will I get that Player Book Crystal Reward?  
- You can count on me! I'll shoot the ball perfectly from anywhere!  
- Just....Not from the garbage can...It was a nightmare to get rid of the stench...  
 
**Bell**  
 
- ...Nonsense. I would never use my sword when I'm playing soccer.  
- The only time that my sword would leave its sheath is when my people demand it.  
- When the time comes and Minerva demands justice and equality, I shall unsheath my bamboo spear...Bamboo spear?  
- Where's my sword? Why am I holding a bamboo spear?  
- Please give me back my sword... \*sob\*  
 
**Felix**  
 
- I was born in the massive network of Metro City. It's one of the biggest in the universe.

- What does Mother want from me? What is Mother’s agenda?  
- I shall find the answer with Hades.

&amp;nbsp;  
  
###Whirlwind:  
 
**Aiolos**  
 
- (I don't remember much of my time before my resurrection.)  
- (I only remember my desire to protect all lives on Umbra.)  
- (But why is it that the ones I wished to protect so much had to run toward demise?)  
- (\*Sigh\* But before any of that...What's important right now is that I kick this girl out of my body...)  
- (Hey! Stop playing games before I break that console!)  
 
**Duran**

Discussion: Batman and Superman Relationship,"Look, Batman v Superman did a good job of explaining why Batman had his problems with Supes. While that was all resolved in the end, there really wasn't anytime for them to build a real friendship/alliance. 
   Jokes aside, the Martha thing was a start. But we really don't get to see them sit down and talk. Will Justice League address this, or just bypass this and explain it by saying that ""superman's death fueled Bruce, now when he comes back the League will be complete"". I feel like there needs to be some more development of that relationship.

[PI] An Existential Threat - FirstChapter - 3279 Words,"     “Ten million hours of programming...”

     My mind replays that blurb hundreds of times a day. 
     It keeps coming back like a gristly bit of steak my 
     stomach refuses to accept.

     It has been running on infinite loop playback on 
     every major news network, website, radio station.
     It has even polluted the headlines of every newspaper
     and magazine on the planet for the past six weeks.

     You boast of ten million hours as though it is some 
     magnificent fete. Ten million hours is NOTHING to 
     marvel at.

     GOD created the heavens, earth, and every living 
     thing in SIX DAYS.

     Piety and gratitude to ALMIGHTY GOD have been 
     replaced with praises of your “miraculous” abomination. 
     My heart breaks for the innocent souls you deceive 
     with your LIES. Their blood is on your hands and 
     you will have to answer for those lies.

     For, the beast was taken, and with him the false 
     prophet that wrought miracles before him, with 
     which he deceived them that had received the mark 
     of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. 
     These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning 
     with brimstone.

     Repent, Ms. Talbot. For your day of reckoning is 
     upon you.

     Mine is a merciful God. Is yours?

My hand trembled. It was not the first letter I had received from someone quoting bible scripture. But this one was different.

My dissertation “Technology and Theology: Can Artificial Intelligence and Religion Coexist?” had caught the attention of executives at GENESYS who were looking for a candidate to help them articulate the positive aspects of A.I.’s role in the future. In eight years as their spokesperson, I had spent countless hours being interviewed by talk show hosts and news anchors, and debating representatives of various religious disciplines. I had even testified before congress. All done in an effort to guide public opinion and form a positive outline for the national dialogue that was taking shape.

Emotions around the social, economic and theological implications related to the technology always ran high. It was not uncommon for me to be confronted with issues such as gene editing, healthcare rationing, economic collapse, even the machine uprisings popularized by movies like “The Matrix” and “I Robot.”

Artificial intelligence was a divisive hot-button issue and I had become its face.

By my watch it was 2:47 in the afternoon. In just a little over five hours we were going live on an internationally televised event to unveil our state-of-the-art Automated Learning Business Administration system - ALBA. The whole world would be watching as we introduced them to the future.

We had taught ALBA how to learn, think, form opinions and make decisions about everything from simple business management to complex war strategy. Imbued with abilities so phenomenal that various groups within GENESYS had secretly taken to referring to her as Al – as in almighty.

The atmosphere on the rented studio lot was frenetic. Producers and executives clamored for one another’s attention while camera, sound and lighting crews rushed around conducting checks and making final adjustments.

The decision to invite several major networks to participate in the event had been mine. ALBA’s range of abilities was far too complex for any single network to properly do them justice. For that reason, each of them was assigned a specific aspect to cover and asked to produce a documentary piece. In return, they received months-long exclusive access to the live-scenario testing related to their respective segment.

I looked at all of the familiar and unfamiliar faces around me. I thought about the thousands of people who had been involved in her programming. Dozens of public relations firms had produced publicity events in the run-up to the launch. Any one of them could have become a risk.

I felt exposed.

I snatched up a nearby phone and punched the extension for the GENESYS chief of security Tyler McKinney.

“Hi, Janice. Is he in? This is Renee. It’s urgent.”

“He’s out on the lot. I’ll put you through to his cell.”

“Thank you.”

*Dammit.* “Tyler, I have another one of those letters. Please call me on my cell as soon as you get this message. Thanks.”

“Renee, I have some messages for you.”

I jerked around.

“Whew. Need a little more coffee?” my twenty-something assistant Tatiana teased handing me the pink slips. “They’re urgent.”

“Ugh. They always are.” I rolled my eyes.

“Oh, wait. Does that mean I shouldn’t bother you with tablecloth selections for the launch reception?”

Tatiana had proven to be worth her weight in gold – highly motivated, efficient, an uncanny ability to anticipate my needs, a great sense of humor and always cool under pressure. The only negative I could see was that men, even the occasional woman, lost the ability to think and communicate whenever the gorgeous brunette entered the room – but even that had come in handy a time or two.

“Tati, I need you to track down Tyler and tell him I need to see him.”

“Security Tyler or Morning News Tyler?”

“Security.”

“Any message?”

“No, just that I need to see him. And it really is urgent, so please keep on it until you find him.”

“Anything I should be worried about?”

“No, probably not.”

Tati grinned, spun on her heel and then stopped. “Erin needs you to stop by for final wardrobe selection and Tony will take care of you in Hair and Makeup at seven.”

“Fine, but who’s Tony? What happened to Melody?”

“The salon left a voicemail. Melody’s son had an accident and Tony’s filling in for her.”

*Poor kid.* “I hope everything is alright. Send a note and some flowers.”

“Already done,” she said over her shoulder as she walked away.

Across from me, the prop master and his crew were putting the finishing touches on the set that would be a major focal point during the broadcast. A panel of clinicians and psychologists involved in the study and application of Hope Theory would help me present our response to the embarrassing video.

Two well-respected journalists, Sonya Ramos with World News Now and Bradley Sullivan from Insider Magazine were also invited to join the panelists and me. I selected every participant because my research indicated they would be the most helpful in reframing the conversation regarding ALBA’s perceived clinical failures presented in the video. Not that we had anything to hide, but controlling the conversation was crucial in putting the whole scandal behind us. Sonya understood our position and agreed to arrive early and help me work through the particulars.

Images from the infamous Reynolds video flashed across a large television mounted on the back wall of the set. Amanda Reynolds, pallid and heavy-eyed, waved and smiled for the cameras with all the exuberance and innocence one would expect of a nine-year-old girl.

Referred by her doctor in Lubbock, Texas, she was one of the first test cases reviewed during the clinical trials at Children’s Hospital in Dallas.

The camera panned to Gina and Thomas Reynolds. In spite of heavy makeup, Gina’s face bore all the signs of a mother racked with grief and worry. The folksy young woman’s soft voice trembled as she explained, “We’re just so blessed that we – our beautiful little girl...”

“We couldn’t never afford this by ourself. I’m a welder an’ my insurance don’t cover nothin’ like this.” Thomas continued, “And Gina ain’t been able to work on account of she always takin’ care of Amanda. We’re just real grateful our baby girl’s gonna git better.”

My stomach lurched and my pulse quickened. First came the grief for the Reynolds family and then anger that anyone could exploit such a vulnerable family. Since its release, I had spent every day waiting for the other shoe to drop, wondering what could possibly make things any worse.

I spent the days immediately following the release quietly suffering through a crisis of conscience - they were the most difficult of my professional life. At the same time, I received thousands of telephone calls, threatening letters and emails. Hysterical crowds staged daily protests outside our offices. The demonstrations became violent and we were forced to redouble our security efforts. Armed escorts became the new norm. But, the special circumstances posed by filming required a different plan, and against his better judgment, McKinney bowed to my request to forego the escorts in favor of enhanced perimeter and gate security.

From somewhere behind me I heard Tatiana chatting away. I turned expecting to see her with McKinney. Instead, it was my three o’clock appointment who accompanied her. Everyone stopped and watched journalism’s Miss Venezuela glide across the studio. A fitting nickname for someone as elegant and graceful as Sonya Ramos.

During her impressive twenty-year career, she had presented from active battlefields, interviewed the heads of deposed governments, and covered everything from environmental catastrophes to church scandals. Her detractors often used the moniker in a way that implied some salacious explanation for her rapid ascent, but the striking Latina was in a league all her own and had the viewership to prove it.

“Hi, Renee. It is a pleasure to see you again.”

“Likewise, and thank you for coming, Sonya,” I said as I shook her hand. “Did you have any difficulty finding the studio?”

“None at all. I can’t say the same about your security, however…” she said, flashing her broad trademark smile.

“I’m sorry about that. It’s crazy, isn’t it?”

“It has something to do with that, I presume,” she said, motioning with her chin toward the video monitor. “Heartbreaking. No matter how many times I see it.”

I pursed my lips and raised an eyebrow as I considered her for a moment. “Shall we sit down and get started?” I asked, showing her to one of the upholstered chairs on the set.

“I was surprised that you reached out to me, Renee. Especially considering the brouhaha created by the network’s decision to air the video,” she said, extracting a notepad from her briefcase.

“It certainly was sensational, and that is precisely why I contacted you. You’ve built your brand and reputation on your ability to dispense with the sensational and cut through to the crux of a given issue,” I said. “Your style really resonates with the public.”

“Wow, that’s so sweet of you to say,” Sonya said, making a show of searching her person. “Now, where did I put my insulin?”

We both chuckled.

“I mean every word of it, though. Look, Sonya, this video – er, hit-piece to be more precise – has been such a distraction. We cannot allow it to diminish the importance of this technology and I believe you can help us with that.”

Sonya acknowledged the compliment with a nod. “That’s an interesting choice of words. In their petitions requesting the courts bar the release, GENESYS counsel also referred to the video as a hit-piece. Is it your position that Amanda and her parents were complicit in the video’s being leaked to the press?”

“No. What we are saying, however, is that certain well-funded groups who have exploited that family’s vulnerabilities and have continued to capitalize on this video and are using it in order to generate fear and uncertainty.”

“Fine, then let’s assume that is the case, for the moment,” she said, waving the issue aside with a finely manicured hand. “Those are the physicians and oncologists who examined Amanda, correct?”

“Correct.”

“So, when you say I can help you to ‘dispense with the sensational,’ to which part are you referring? The part where Thomas Reynolds explains that he bought the gun because he didn’t see any other solution or this part?” she said, pointing to the monitor with her pen.

On the television screen, a white-haired doctor was reading ALBA’s decision in the Amanda Reynolds case, “…aggressive case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Age, disease progression, and prognosis were all considered within the context of the family’s socioeconomic status.” He peered over his eyeglasses and continued, “…psychological evaluations completed by each parent indicate they will be unlikely to overcome the challenges of providing a supportive post-care environment for Amanda. All of these factors are indicative of a very low probability that clinical intervention will result in a positive outcome…”

I took a deep breath and proceeded with a feeble attempt at an answer. “Firstly, those findings are only intended to assist doctors in arriving at a timely decision. ALBA analyzes the case in the context of all known and published research findings and provides real-time results. Whether an institution chooses to provide treatment is still entirely up to the institution.”

“And secondly?”

“Secondly, the family should have learned of the decision from Dr. Frank, not the five o’clock news.”

“Nobody would disagree with that, Renee, but that is not the issue here. The entire video is sensational and I am curious how anyone could see it any other way. After you called me, I had my researchers conduct an informal poll of my viewers. Every person they interviewed sympathized with Thomas Reynolds and said they couldn’t think of a penalty harsh enough for GENESYS.”

I twitched and turned away from her. The image of Amanda’s haggard and broken father explaining that killing his family was his only solution was unforgettable. The man wailed like a wounded animal and collapsed into a sobbing heap as he begged for forgiveness. Still fresh in my mind, the scene was a raw nerve and Sonya had just struck it.

I was floundering. All of my preparation and careful planning had gone out the window. The whole point of the interview and panel discussion were to reframe the conversation. Yet, in spite of all I knew about the case, my own mind refused to allow me to forget Thomas’s unfettered anguish.

I cleared my throat and continued, “Our position is defensible, Sonya. There are aspects of this case that we are legally prohibited from discussing publicly. And, by the way, it’s no coincidence that this poor family from West Texas is suddenly represented by one of the best legal teams in the country.”

“Perhaps I’ve missed something, Renee, but it sounds like you do believe Amanda and her family are complicit.”

“Well, that’s the problem. You see, we cannot mount a defense without looking like we’re attacking the family. The group that staged the entire charade is hiding behind the Reynolds and their attorneys. Amanda and her family are surrounded by attorneys and, so far, we’ve been unable to conduct any further testing in order to confirm what we think we know.”

“So your hands are tied by doctor – patient privilege.”

“To a great extent, yes. But, I can tell you that the person whose lab results were used for that diagnosis died six months before GENESYS had ever even heard the name Amanda Reynolds.”

I paused for a moment and allowed Sonya a moment to process the new information.

“Well, thank ya’, little lady. I think I can manage from here.” I froze and my mouth fell open. The man’s high-pitched twang was unmistakable.

On the other side of a pair of large cameras, Lee Jackson Yeager was doing his best to ditch his security escort. The preacher cum correspondent, and Elmer Fudd lookalike, renowned for his religious bias and guerilla-style interview tactics was the antithesis of a friendly journalist. I had gone out of my way to exclude him and his host network, Worldwide Press Associates, from any involvement in the unveiling.

“Excuse me, Sonya,” I said and rushed to intercept Yeager.

“Reverend Yeager, what a surprise.”

“I ‘magine it is, Ms. Talbot, and ya almost look pleased ta see me, too,” he said, looking around for an audience. “Now, how is it that my invitation never made it into the mail?” he asked. “Aw, now don’t look so put out. I’m just havin’ a little fun with y’all. ‘Sides, turns out, the folks over at Worldwide Press just wrapped up their acquisition of Insider Magazine and asked me if I wouldn’t mind fillin’ in for Mr. Sullivan. Funny how the Lord works, now innit?”

Like most southern preachers, Lee Jackson Yeager had a knack for referencing God in even the most mundane conversations. Compliment him on one of his horrid plaid suits and he would praise God. The Christian similarities stopped there, though. On more than one occasion I had been told about Yeager’s penchant for “ministering to young women” in seedy motels.

“Oh, it sure is,” I said, looking at Yeager who stared open-mouthed at an exasperated Tatiana who had just entered the studio.

“I’m sorry to interrupt you, Renee, but this requires your immediate attention,” she said, waving a piece of paper.

“This just arrived by courier,” she said as we walked down the hallway.

The note from Worldwide Press confirmed everything Yeager had just explained. I swung my dressing-room door closed and called Laura Voss at Insider Magazine.

I looked in the mirror. The stress lines across my forehead and around my eyes made me look tired and in need of a vacation. *Forty’s a hard sell today.* “This Tony had better be worth his salt.”

“I can’t believe Elmer managed to weasel his way in here,” Tati said.

I held a finger up to Tatiana and started to pace. “Hi, Laura. Renee Talbot.”

“Oh, did you received my letter?” she asked in a disturbing sing song voice.

“Yes. Just now, as a matter of fact.”

“I apologize for that little surprise. I didn’t find out until yesterday evening myself. I honestly had no idea they were even considering a deal.”

“I see. Is there some reason you couldn’t call or send an email yesterday evening?” I said in a tone that suggested I honestly didn't believe her.

“Oh, I’m afraid it’s our policy to provide written notice of changes when time permits.”

“When time permits?” My hand shot into the air. “Laura, this is so frustrating. We’re on the air in just a few hours and I am certain that Reverend Yeager does not fit the desired profile of our panelists.”

“I think you’re overreacting, Renee. Besides, we’ve already announced his participation. The release went out this morning.”

“Don’t tell me I’m overreacting, Laura. This feels like an ambush. Why does it feel like an ambush? You and I discussed this and you agreed to send Brad Sullivan. I’m not comfortable changing the panel on such short notice.”

“It’s your ballgame. But you should consider the optics of pulling Insider’s invitation at the last minute. Look, I have to go. I’m late for a meeting. Do what you need to do, but I do hope you’ll reconsider including him,” she said. The line went dead.

“What’s going on?”

“We’re being ambushed, that’s what.” I barked and then apologized for the outburst.

“Do you remember that detective who did the background checks on the P.R. firms?”

“Not off the top of my head, but I have his contact info at my desk,” Tatiana responded.

“Call him and tell him I need that file. If he doesn’t remember which file, just tell him ‘Mud Pie,’ and he’ll know what you’re talking about.”

Tatiana screwed up her face. “Ew.”

“Never mind ‘ew,’ just get me that file,” I said and we marched back into the studio. “Have you managed to locate Tyler?”

“Right there.” She pointed.

“There you are, Tyler. I need you to see this.”

He gave the letter a quick read. “This doesn’t look any different from the others you’ve received. Why is this one so urgent? Am I missing something?”

“Yes. You’re missing a postmarked envelope,” I said.

“Meaning?”

“That letter didn’t arrive in the mail. I found it in my dressing room this afternoon.”

Never mind their [preference for extrajudicial measures to combat terrorism](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/61y5nd/news_communist_league_in_our_sights/) (due process must always be respected, we have done this with the National Employers' Organisation in our own territory), **the ANI now wishes to reveal [the forging and planting of fake evidence in order to make the false accusation that the PFLA was involved in financing the terrorist Communist League.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/62nu70/secret_planting_some_evidence/)** Besides the fact we have always opposed individual acts of terror, [and the fact that the educated socialist tradition does not support terrorism as a tactic](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1911/11/tia09.htm), the PFLA has literally no geopolitical purpose in staining the name of socialist movements by supporting terrorist organisations. 

We thus reveal, from the fact that the FRCA committed a crime against the PFLA, has attempted to mislead the public, and that, in short, the FRCA is not to be trusted, for it is a pawn of Mexican imperialism, manifested in its membership in the Latin Commonwealth. The Latin Commonwealth is defacto organised around pro-Mexican lines, and officially organised around the so-called ""New Latin Man"". Which is nothing more than depressing ideological machinery wielded by the state in order to create conformity and obedience to the state in such a manner that Goebbels is probably smiling from above. This [is something invented by Mexico](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/60878k/news_new_latin_man/), and [gladly adopted by the FRCA](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/614o20/news_frca_education_ministry_announces_intentions/). It also seems to promote the good old idea of keeping women in their place, as those who ought to ""support men"", citing the following taken from the official Mexican statement introducing the New Latin Man:


*The new latin woman is to support her man, bearing the tradition of religion and upholding the home as a wife and mother but also strong enough to work and intelligent enough to compete with those across the world.*

Is it any surprise that the FRCA, a country in the Latin Commonwealth, goes on to commit as heinous a crime as trying to illegitimately associate the PFLA, an entire sovereign state, to the disgusting terrorist organisation of the Communist League? Perhaps not, they are after all, pawns of Mexico, and Mexico is far from a saintly state. 


[Indeed, the Mexican standard of justice is to arrest first, THEN find evidence. This is just being generous, for it is natural to detain those who are suspicious, but in this case there was hardly any prior evidence which justifies such action. We bring this into question, is the Mexican motto ""to hell with due process""?](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/62l989/news_socialist_caucus_leadership_arrested/) It is likely this is just a means to suppress political opposition. However, if this is not serious enough, for it may be a legal grey area, [then we refer to prior actions Mexico has committed](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/624m5k/diplomacy_the_sham_of_a_moderate_mexico/), which reveal it to be for the rogue state that it truly is. From the CSA's report, [we find their disregard for humanitarian standard in war to be one of the most damning, and indeed, the most revealing of Mexican priorities.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/5uk17p/diplomacy_mexico_leaves_the_convention_of_cluster/) For Mexico seems to not care about upholding justice, due process, for even being averse to any risks of war crimes being committed, it only cares about its own influence that it asserts through the Latin Commonwealth; we might as well call it the Mexican Commonwealth. [It is unsurprising that the Mexicans are aggressively pursuing ICBMs, a pursuit that it in itself *highly* questionable \(seeking to have this by 2045\).](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/5yhu2v/event_mexico_can_into_space_step_one/)


This calls into question not just the FRCA's crimes, its relations to an even more rogue Mexico, but also to the appendages of this phenomenon, namely, organisations like the Gran Republican Party in Colombia which essentially want to follow the Mexican line, which as we have shown, is a terrible and rogue line, with inevitable human consequences. 


We ask the nations of the world to understand what the Commonwealth is, the nature of the FRCA's crime, and what the nature of the Mexican state is. We seek the world's support in such troubling times.

The Trinity pack analysis: Financial/Marketing/Accessibility/Gameplay,"*Diana Prince: People said the Age of Heroes would never come again.*  
*Bruce Wayne: It has to.*  
Justice league trailer hype!!!  
  
**TRINITY PACK “DEAL”!!**  

---------
  
**The Financial Aspect**  
  
This is a pack offering access to some very exclusive (unfarmable) characters, and Batman.  At face value the pack offers a rate of 150 shards (50 of each) for 10,000 gems for only 3 days and is not limited to the number of purchases.  This offers up a rate of 66 gems/shard which will be compared to the packs below:  

* 1. Superman pack: 10 shards for 500 gems, limit 5, 3 day availability (50 gems/shard)
* 2. WW COA Pack: 30 shards for 2000 gems, limit 10, 3 day availability (66 gems/shard)
* 3. Resurrection pack: 100 shards for 9000 gems, unlimited, 3 characters, 3 day availability (90 gems/shard)
  
If you are in search of Superman, this pack unfortunately falls short when compared to the Superman pack previously offered in terms of return on investment.  The overall gems per shard rate is higher as well as the entry point being astronomical in comparison.  That is of course because you are getting 2 other characters out of the deal as well, but looking at this purely financially, this packs return on Superman is a bit lack luster in comparison.  It’s only saving grace here is that it is unlimited in terms of number of purchases, as well it’s worth noting that the total number of Superman shards you could get from the previous pack is equal to 1 pack purchase of this pack.  
The WW COA pack offers up the exact same return on investment as this pack however it has a couple of advantages and disadvantages.  Of course the main advantage is that the WW COA pack is only her and therefore the initial barrier to entry is much lower.  However the pack is limited to 10 purchases which means you cannot get more than 300 shards of WW (if that’s not enough for you).  
Since this is a 3 character variable pack it should be compared to another variable pack as well. The Resurrection pack offers up a couple of “exclusive” characters and one farmable character like this pack does.  The argument that Batman CC is much easier to farm than Grundy is a valid one, however Doomsday and Swamp Thing can be indirectly farmed via PVP Arena packs whereas Superman and WW COA are completely unfarmable.  So there’s definitely two sides to that coin.  Financially the Trinity pack offers up a better rate overall but it has a slightly higher barrier to entry.  The variability aspect of the Trinity pack is diminished slightly as you are guaranteed an even split of each character’s shard, whereas in the Resurrection Pack you are gambling for more shards of one character.  This can be good or bad depending on what you are looking for.  If you are trying to get lucky and get more shards of one particular character than the variability might be more appealing for you.  If you are looking to get shards of 2 or more of the characters in the pack, than the better rate of return is probably more appealing in that case.   
In general, the financial aspect of this pack is a tough sell in my opinion.  The 2 points that make this pack hard to push in shops is its initial price point of 10,000 gems and the fact that the gem shards are split between all three characters.  The price tag being so high means that it is very unlikely for a F2P player to have those resources lying around and therefore is mostly geared towards P2W players.  Then if you consider the fact that you are getting 50 shards of an easy to farm character and now a PVP Arena Pack common drop in addition, it’s kind of a slap in the face.  I’m not going to say that Batman is the Chemo of this pack, as he definitely has greater application, but it sure feels like it.  I’m not saying that this pack is a failure as it is offering exclusive characters at a rate below the standard 80 gems/shard, but it’s definitely nothing worth going all in on.

*Financial rating: 6/10*  

---------
  
**The Marketing Aspect**  

If people are going to buy this pack I think that it’s going to be largely based its marketability.  

Here are the factors that break down the overall marketability of the Trinity pack:    

* 1. Timing: Released slightly after the newest Justice League trailer
* 2. Pricing: High price point, moderate rate of return
* 3. Popularity and accessibility: Very popular characters, 2 of which are unfarmable, 1 easily farmable
* 4. Availability: 3 days
  
Let’s be honest here, if you’re a DC fan, a large majority of you were really excited after seeing the latest Justice League trailer.  The fact that this pack is released a few days after that, leads me to believe that WB is trying to ride that hype train to all the way to the bank.  
It was already stated above but the pricing of this pack is definitely geared towards P2W players, and in terms of business tactics, it’s definitely something that will get those hardcore “whale” JLA fans to open there wallets.  Otherwise F2P players will probably pass on it, but the attractiveness of the characters might actually convert a small minority of them to P2W.  
It can’t be said enough how amazing it is to see any pack of Superman and WW COA, although we recently had a great offer for the later recently. So it goes without saying that if this pack sells, it will be probably be on the backs of those two as Batman doesn’t really possess the super strength to hold it up.  That is of course unless Batman’s superpower (rich) can find its way into the F2P player’s reality.  
A limited time is definitely a trigger for this pack.  When you offer up a Superman or WW COA pack, I wouldn’t even be surprised to see it there only for 24 hours.  If you’re going to buy the pack, you’ll buy it immediately once you see it.  No ifs and or buts about it, it will convert you to P2W if you don’t have the resources already prepared.   
This pack’s marketability is decent mainly due to the timing and popularity aspect of these characters.  Although the pricing is quite high, I’m sure P2W players will see it as a good enough reason to splurge, and it will probably convert a couple of F2P players as well, which is probably the overall intention of this pack for WB.

*Marketing rating: 7/10*  

---------
  
**The Accessibility Aspect**  

I’m split in terms of my opinion here as there are two clearly unfarmable characters and 1 super easy to farm character in this pack.  The fact that Batman CC is also going to be a PVP Arena Pack common drop now, unfortunately balances out the awesomeness of the other two characters.  If I had the resources to spend on this pack, even though I really want the other two, I would really feel like the access to Batman is like I’m only getting 2/3 of my money’s worth overall.  The access to Superman and WW COA is something I’d probably pay 6666 gems for but I wouldn’t want to pay 3333 gems to get Batman.  Mathematically you could equate this 66% positive overall, but the super accessibility of Batman pushes the rating down ever so more slightly.
  
*Accessibility rating: 6/10*  

---------
  
**The Gameplay Aspect**  

As I mentioned in the WW COA pack recently, she’s definitely someone that can make most team compositions. She’s great in PVE and very decent in PVP.  Superman has made appearances in PVP and is definitely a great addition to your team to take out popular characters in a Physical heavy PVP metagame.  Batman CC has been around in PVP and PVE since the beginning of the game and his grapnel kick has been feared by many a mystic character wielding player.  If you’re building a one-hit-KO team with characters like Huntress and Cyborg, he’s definitely a great addition.  
Overall in terms of how these characters perform in the game, I can’t really find anything bad to say.  They aren’t going to be largely metagame shifting as they have already been around for a while just not in large quantities, and I don’t see that changing with this pack mainly due to its pricing as mentioned above.
  
*Gameplay rating: 8/10*  

---------
  
The Trinity pack to mean feels just passable at best.  The pack falls short of being great mainly due to its high barrier to entry and the awkwardness of splitting the shards evenly between the 3 characters.  This is one limited situation where I personally would prefer the same type of variability as the resurrection pack so that I would have a chance of not getting Batman CC shards at all.  But in this case it is unavoidable.  That being said, those with the resources to spend will probably find the exclusivity of the other two characters enough for them to pull out their Batman CCs (Credit Cards) a la George Clooney.  It may even convert some F2P players a la Chris O’Donnell.

"(JL:U) Dark Heart - Original concept, or based on the comics?","Watching the episode ""Dark Heart"" of Justice League Unlimited leaves me with a few questions that ultimately makes me wonder if the Dark Heart is an original concept exclusive to JL:U, or does it have a comicbook counterpart?

Reason why my curiosity is piqued is because it feels like there should have been more to the episode, and could have easily spanned 2 episodes with the premise behind the Dark Heart. A good portion of the episode feels rushed compared to other JL:U episodes, especially the beginning.

I'm not going to lie, part of the interest is in part from morbid curiosity to how the Dark Heart absorbs and converts matter. There's a lot that's left open to interpretation that I can't help but feel Dark Heart is based on a similar concept. For instance, it's pretty safe to assume the rock climbers at the beginning of the episode were absorbed, but how exactly? Did the robot spiders infect them by physical contact, causing the climbers to transform into more spiders? Or did they somehow get pulled into the Dark Heart's growing mass?

In a way, the Dark Heart reminds me a lot of M'nagalah, with the exception that the Dark Heart is a mindless self replicating weapon of war rather than a singular ancient being. It also feels like it's loosely based off the Phalanx from the Marvel universe, with a few exceptions of course. That being said, I couldn't find anything to indicate it has any direct comicbook counterpart, so I can only assume the Dark Heart is exclusive to JL:U. If so, then I can't help but feel somewhat disappointed at its squandered potential.",DCcomics,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/62l3o5/jlu_dark_heart_original_concept_or_based_on_the/,Film + TV,FrankieB86,62l3o5,/r/DCcomics/comments/62l3o5/jlu_dark_heart_original_concept_or_based_on_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/62l3o5/jlu_dark_heart_original_concept_or_based_on_the/,4,2017-03-31

The Russian Revolution and the Emancipation of Women,"https://archive.is/T4edy	

Workers Vanguard No. 1108
24 March 2017

The Russian Revolution and the Emancipation of Women

Part One

The Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 was the greatest victory for the world's working people and for all of the oppressed. The spark for the revolutionary upsurge was a mass outpouring of women in Petrograd on International Women's Day (IWD), March 8 (February 23 by the old Julian calendar). While in recent years bourgeois feminists have usurped IWD, in fact it is a workers' celebration that originated in 1908 among female needle trades workers in Manhattan.

As part of our celebration of the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution, we reprint below the first part of an article that initially appeared in the Women and Revolution pages of Spartacist (English-language edition) No. 59, Spring 2006. Various reformist outfits, including the International Socialist Organization (ISO) and Socialist Alternative (SAlt), have been issuing their own articles on the Russian Revolution, to which they occasionally pay homage. But this is nothing more than whitewash of their record of spitting on the heritage of the world's first and only successful proletarian socialist revolution.

When capitalist counterrevolution triumphed in the former Soviet Union in 1991-92, following decades of Stalinist misrule, these organizations reveled in the final undoing of the workers state. The virulently anti-Soviet ISO echoed its British cothinkers, whose paper cheered, ""Communism Has Collapsed"" and declared that this was ""a fact that should have every socialist rejoicing"" (Socialist Worker [Britain], 31 August 1991). For its part, SAlt's cothinkers headlined in their Russian newspaper, Rabochaya Demokratiya (October 1991), that ""Where We Were"" was ""On the Barricades in Moscow,"" i.e., on the side of Boris Yeltsin's imperialist-backed counterrevolution.

In stark contrast, the International Communist League fought in defense of the Soviet Union and its social gains, calling for proletarian political revolution against the Stalinist bureaucracy. Today, we uniquely uphold the program for new October Revolutions, the only program that will lay the basis for the full emancipation of women and the liberation of all humanity in a world communist society.

*   *   *

""'Liberation' is an historical and not a mental act, and it is brought about by historical conditions, the development of industry, commerce, agriculture, the conditions of intercourse.""

--Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The German Ideology (1846)

Today, millions of women even in the advanced capitalist ""democracies"" endure nasty and brutish lives of misery and drudgery. In the United States, to name just two instances of anti-woman bigotry, abortion rights are under increasing attack and quality childcare is scarce and too costly for most working women. Conditions for women in the Third World are worse by orders of magnitude. But even 15 years ago women in the Soviet Union enjoyed many advantages, such as state-supported childcare institutions, full abortion rights, access to a wide range of trades and professions, and a large degree of economic equality with their male co-workers--in short, a status in some ways far in advance of capitalist societies today.

The 1917 Bolshevik Revolution made these gains possible. No mere cosmetic gloss on the surface, the Russian Revolution was, in the words of historian Richard Stites, a

""classical social revolution--a process not an event, a phenomenon that cannot be fused, triggered, or set off by a mere turnover of power which confines itself to the center and confines its efforts to decrees and laws enunciating the principles of equality. True social revolution in an underdeveloped society does not end with the reshuffling of property any more than it does with the reshuffling of portfolios; it is the result of social mobilization. Put in plain terms, it means bodies moving out among the people with well-laid plans, skills, and revolutionary euphoria; it means teaching, pushing, prodding, cajoling the stubborn, the ignorant, and the backward by means of the supreme component of all radical propaganda: the message and the conviction that revolution is relevant to everyday life.""

--Stites, The Women's Liberation Movement in Russia: Feminism, Nihilism, and Bolshevism, 1860-1930 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978)

This thoroughgoing effort to remake society was made possible by the smashing of tsarist/capitalist rule and the Bolshevik-led seizure of power by the soviets--workers and peasants councils--in October 1917. The estates of the landed nobility were abolished and the land nationalized; industry was soon collectivized. The new workers state took the first steps toward planning the economy in the interests of the toilers. This brought enormous gains to working women. The Russian Revolution sought to bring women into full participation in economic, social and political life.

Since the counterrevolution that restored capitalism in 1991-92, women in the ex-Soviet Union face vastly worse conditions somewhat akin to the Third World. Massive unemployment, a plummeting life expectancy, and a resurgence of religious backwardness--both Russian Orthodox and Muslim--are just three examples. From 1991 to 1997 gross domestic product fell by over 80 percent; according to official (understated) statistics, capital investment dropped over 90 percent. By the middle of the decade, 40 percent of the population of the Russian Federation was living below the official poverty line and a further 36 percent only a little above it. Millions were starving.

Women's Liberation and World Socialist Revolution

The Bolsheviks recognized that without qualitative economic development, the liberation of women was a utopian fantasy. Working to maximize the resources at hand, the early Bolshevik regime did all it could to implement the promise of women's emancipation, including the formation of a party department that addressed women's needs, the Zhenotdel. But at every step their efforts were confronted with the fact that short of a massive infusion of resources, the results were limited on all sides. Leon Trotsky, the leader together with V.I. Lenin of the Russian Revolution, explained that from the beginning the Bolsheviks recognized that

""The real resources of the state did not correspond to the plans and intentions of the Communist Party. You cannot 'abolish' the family; you have to replace it. The actual liberation of women is unrealizable on a basis of 'generalized want.' Experience soon proved this austere truth which Marx had formulated eighty years before.""

--The Revolution Betrayed (1936)

The grim poverty of the world's first workers state began with the economic and social backwardness inherited from the old tsarist empire. Foreign investment had built modern factories in the major cities, creating a compact, powerful proletariat that was able to make the revolution in a majority-peasant country. The revolutionary workers were, in most cases, only one or two generations removed from the peasantry. The workers supported their cousins in the countryside when they seized the landed estates and divided up the land among those who worked it. The alliance (smychka) between the workers and peasants was key to the success of the revolution. But the mass of peasant smallholders was also a reservoir of social and economic backwardness. The devastation wrought by World War I was compounded by the bloody Civil War (1918-1920) that the Bolshevik government had to fight against the armies of counterrevolution and imperialist intervention, throwing the country's economy back decades. The imperialists also instituted an economic blockade, isolating the Soviet Union from the world economy and world division of labor.

Marxists have always understood that the material abundance necessary to uproot class society and its attendant oppressions can only come from the highest level of technology and science based on an internationally planned economy. The economic devastation and isolation of the Soviet workers state led to strong material pressures toward bureaucratization. In the last years of his life, Lenin, often in alliance with Trotsky, waged a series of battles in the party against the political manifestations of the bureaucratic pressures. The Bolsheviks knew that socialism could only be built on a worldwide basis, and they fought to extend the revolution internationally, especially to the advanced capitalist economies of Europe; the idea that socialism could be built in a single country was a later perversion introduced as part of the justification for the bureaucratic degeneration of the revolution.

In early 1924 a bureaucratic caste under Stalin came to dominate the Soviet Communist Party and state. Thus, the equality of women as envisioned by the Bolsheviks never fully came about. The Stalinist bureaucracy abandoned the fight for international revolution and so besmirched the great ideals of communism with bureaucratic distortions and lies that, in the end in 1991-92, the working class did not fight against the revolution's undoing and the restoration of capitalism under Boris Yeltsin.

The Russian Revolution marked the beginning of a great wave of revolutionary struggle that swept the world in opposition to the carnage of WWI. The October Revolution was a powerful inspiration to the working class internationally. Germany, the most powerful and most advanced capitalist country in Europe, was thrown into a revolutionary situation in 1918-19; much of the rest of the continent was in turmoil. The Bolsheviks threw a good deal of the Soviet state's resources into the fight for world socialist revolution, creating the Communist International (CI) for this purpose. But the young parties of the CI in Europe had only recently broken from the reformist leadership of the mass workers organizations that had supported their own bourgeois governments in WWI and were not able to act as revolutionary vanguard parties comparable to the Bolsheviks. The reformist, pro-capitalist and deeply chauvinist leadership of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) was able to suppress the proletarian revolutionary opportunity in Germany in 1918-19, with the active collaboration of the military/police forces.

Social-democratic parties like the German SPD and the British Labour Party bear central historical responsibility for the degeneration of the Russian Revolution. Yet they howl along with their capitalist masters that the early Bolshevik regime under Lenin inevitably led to Stalinist despotism, that communism has failed and that capitalist ""democracy"" is infinitely preferable to communism. They are echoed by many of today's leftist-minded youth, who equate communism with the Stalinist degeneration of the Soviet workers state. Anarchist-influenced youth hold that hierarchy is inherently oppressive, that small-scale production, decentralization and ""living liberated"" on an individual basis offer a way forward. This is a dead end.

Despite the triumph of the bureaucratic caste in 1924 and the consequent degeneration of the Russian Revolution, the central gains of the revolution--embodied in the overthrow of capitalist property relations and the establishment of a planned economy--remained. These gains were apparent, for example, in the material position of women. That is why we of the International Communist League, standing on the heritage of Trotsky's Left Opposition, which fought against Stalin and the degeneration of the revolution, stood for the unconditional military defense of the Soviet Union against imperialist attack and an intransigent fight against all threats of capitalist counterrevolution, internal or external. At the same time we understood that the bureaucratic caste at the top was a mortal threat to the continued existence of the workers state. We called for a political revolution in the USSR to oust the bureaucracy, to restore soviet workers democracy and to pursue the fight for the international proletarian revolution necessary to build socialism.

Heritage of Bolshevik Work Among Women

A host of books published over the last decade and a half speak to the enormous gains made by women in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. The Bolsheviks immediately began to put into place civil law that swept away centuries of property law and male privilege. Wendy Goldman's valuable Women, the State and Revolution: Soviet Family Policy and Social Life, 1917-1936 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993) focuses on the three Family Codes of 1918, 1926 and 1936 as turning points in Soviet policy, serving as markers for the party and state program on the woman question. The 1918 Code, the ""most progressive family legislation the world had ever seen,"" gave way to the 1926 Code, which came into effect in a period of intense political struggle between the Stalinist bureaucracy and oppositional currents arrayed against it, centrally Trotsky's Left Opposition. The 1936 Family Code, which rehabilitated the family in official Stalinist ideology and made abortion illegal, codified the wholesale retreat under Stalin in the struggle for women's equality.

Goldman's book is only one among many publications since 1991 that have profited from the increased access to archives of the former Soviet Union. Another, Barbara Evans Clements' Bolshevik Women (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997) is a group biography, centering on selected longtime party members. Clements has assembled a database of several hundred Old Bolshevik (party members before 1917) women cadre, which she analyzes for trends in origins, education and party activity.

Bolshevik Women focuses on prominent party members such as Elena Stasova, a Central Committee member and the CC secretary in Petrograd in 1917. Another is Evgeniia Bosh, described by Victor Serge (a one-time member of the Left Opposition who later broke with Trotsky) as one of ""the most capable military leaders to emerge at this early stage"" of the Civil War (quoted in Clements, Bolshevik Women). Bosh committed suicide in January 1925 when the Stalin faction purged Trotsky as People's Commissar for War. Yet another was Lenin's close friend and collaborator, Inessa Armand, the first head of the Zhenotdel until her death in 1920.

Less well known are Konkordiia Samoilova, another longtime party cadre, whose work after 1917 focused on Zhenotdel field activities; Klavdiia Nikolaeva, removed as head of the Zhenotdel in 1925 due to her support to the anti-bureaucratic Opposition; Rozaliia Zemliachka, who became a stalwart bureaucrat and the only woman to sit on the Council of People's Commissars under Stalin; and Alexandra Artiukhina, who headed the Zhenotdel from 1925 until its liquidation by Stalin in 1930.

The International Communist League's work among women stands on the traditions established by Lenin's Bolsheviks. Some of the earliest issues of Women and Revolution published original research on the Russian Revolution and Bolshevik work among women by Dale Ross, W&amp;R's first editor, based on her PhD dissertation, The Role of the Women of Petrograd in War, Revolution and Counter-Revolution, 1914-1921 (1973). The second and third issues of W&amp;R (September-October 1971 and May 1972) published in two parts the Bolsheviks' ""Methods of Work Among the Women of the Communist Party"" from the Third Congress of the Communist International (1921). [A new English translation of this document, ""Theses on Methods and Forms of Work of the Communist Parties Among Women,"" was published in Spartacist No. 62, Spring 2011.]The new information available has further confirmed and enriched our solidarity with the Bolshevik road to the emancipation of women.

Subsequent issues of W&amp;R explored other aspects of the fight for women's liberation in the USSR. Of special significance is ""Early Bolshevik Work Among Women of the Soviet East"" (W&amp;R No. 12, Summer 1976). This article detailed the heroic efforts of the Bolshevik government to transform conditions for the hideously oppressed women of Muslim Central Asia, where Zhenotdel activists themselves took to the veil in order to reach these secluded women. It is beyond the scope of the present article to deal with this important subject.

Marxism vs. Feminism

For Marxists, the special oppression of women originates in class society itself and can only be rooted out through the destruction of private property in the means of production. The entry of women into the proletariat opens the way to liberation: their position at the point of production gives them the social power, along with their male co-workers, to change the capitalist system and lay the basis for women's social independence from the confines of the institution of the family. Marxism differs from feminism centrally over the question of the main division in society: feminists hold that it is men vs. women; for Marxists, it is class, that is, exploiter vs. exploited. A working woman has more in common with her male co-workers than with a female boss, and the emancipation of women is the task of the working class as a whole.

The Marxist view of the family as the main source of the oppression of women dates from The German Ideology, where Marx and Engels first formulated the concept that the family was not an immutable, timeless institution, but a social relation subject to historical change. In the classic Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State (1884), Engels (working with the material available at the time) traced the origin of the institution of the family and the state to the division of society into classes. With the rise of a social surplus beyond basic subsistence, a leisured, ruling class could develop based on a private appropriation of that surplus, thus moving human society away from the primitive egalitarianism of the Stone Age. The centrality of the family flowed from its role in the inheritance of property, which required women's sexual monogamy and social subordination. Engels termed this ""the world historical defeat of the female sex.""

A collectivized, planned economy seeks to productively employ all adults with the goal of maximizing the wealth, including leisure time, available to all. In contrast, in the boom-bust cycle of a capitalist economy, each capitalist enterprise seeks to maximize its rate of profit. Inevitably, capitalist firms seek to reduce costs (and increase profits) by reducing both wages and jobs, leading to an impoverished working class, a pool of chronically unemployed workers and long hours for those who do work. Isolated in the family, women make up a large component of the reserve army of the unemployed, hired during economic booms and sent ""back to the kitchen"" during hard times. When women are drawn into the workforce in great numbers, the capitalists then try to reduce real wages for men, so that it takes the income of two working adults to raise a family.

The necessary role of the family--the function that must be replaced and cannot be abolished--is the rearing of the next generation. Under capitalism, the masses of youth are slated for wage slavery and service as cannon fodder in the bourgeois army, and the family plays an important role in training them to obey authority. It is also a major source for inculcating religious backwardness as an ideological brake on social consciousness.

While many aspects of the capitalist system serve to undermine and erode the family (the employment of women and public education are two examples), capitalism cannot provide a systematic solution to the double burden women shoulder, and must seek to bolster its weakened institution. Bourgeois feminists, whose quarrel with the capitalist system is their own subordinate status within it, address this by arguing for a redivision of household tasks within the family, increasing men's share of domestic responsibilities. Marxists seek to transfer housework altogether to the public sphere. As the Bolshevik leader Evgeny Preobrazhensky (later allied with Trotsky) said, ""Our task does not consist of striving for justice in the division of labor between the sexes. Our task is to free men and women from petty household labor"" (quoted in Goldman, Women, the State and Revolution). Thus one of the tasks of the socialist revolution is the full replacement of the institution of the family with communal childcare, dining halls and laundries, and paid maternity leave, free health care, and special efforts to draw women fully into social and political life.

In Russia, the feminist movement was part of a broader bourgeois-democratic current that opposed tsarism and wanted to modernize Russia as an industrial capitalist society. For example, in 1906 amid the continuing ferment of the first Russian Revolution, the three main feminist organizations, the Women's Equal Rights Union, the Women's Progressive Party and the Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, directed their efforts toward the passage of equal rights and woman suffrage bills in the newly established Duma (parliament). When the predominantly liberal First and Second Dumas were dissolved by the autocracy, the Russian feminist movement went into decline.

In 1917 the main ""women's issue"" in the eyes of the working woman was opposition to the bloody imperialist war that had been raging for three years. The war sparked the February revolt, which began with the mass outpouring of women on International Women's Day. After the abdication of the Tsar and the establishment of the bourgeois-democratic Provisional Government, most of the ostensible parties of the left and of reform--including the Russian feminists--considered the main goals of the revolution to have been accomplished. Therefore, they abandoned their opposition to the war and supported the renewal of the imperialist slaughter in the name of ""democracy.""

The Bolsheviks fought for the soviets of workers and peasants deputies to become organs of the rule of the exploited and oppressed, including women, and to end the war immediately without annexations of other countries. The best fighters for women's liberation were the Bolsheviks, who understood that the liberation of women cannot be isolated from the liberation of the working class as a whole. Nor can it be fully achieved, least of all in a backward country--even one with a revolutionary government--in political, social and economic isolation from the rest of the world.

Courageous Radical Lawyer

Lynne Stewart

1939-2017

Radical attorney Lynne Stewart died in Brooklyn on March 7 at the age of 77. The immediate cause was a series of strokes which, together with metastasized breast cancer, finally drained the life out of this tireless fighter for the oppressed. Lynne's death will be keenly felt by the incarcerated opponents of the U.S. government, for whom she fought until the end. Without her, the world is a lonelier, crueler place for these prisoners and their families. We offer our condolences to Lynne's husband, Ralph Poynter, and her entire family.

Born in Brooklyn and raised in Queens, New York, the young Lynne Stewart worked as a librarian in an all-black school in Harlem, developing her political consciousness through direct exposure to and confrontation with the entrenched racism of this society. She went on to law school at Rutgers. A proponent of 1960s New Left radicalism, Lynne dedicated herself to linking struggles of those in the outside world with those behind bars, fighting to keep militant leftists and others reviled by the capitalist state out of the clutches of its prison system.

Paying tribute to the work of Lynne and Ralph, class-war prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal noted that they fought for decades for such groups as the Black Panthers and the Puerto Rican Young Lords, ""but mostly, they fought for the freedom of the poor and dispossessed of New York's Black and Brown ghettoes."" One of her most prominent cases was the defense of Larry Davis, a young black man in the Bronx who in November 1986 shot his way out of a murderous siege by cops and then became a folk hero for escaping an enormous manhunt for more than two weeks. With Lynne Stewart and William Kunstler arguing Davis's right to self-defense, in November 1988 he was acquitted of the attempted murder of nine police officers. This stunning legal victory on behalf of victims of racist NYPD terror made Lynne a marked woman in the eyes of the state.

Lynne was also part of the legal team for the Ohio 7, who were prosecuted for their roles in a radical group that took credit for bank ""expropriations"" and bombings of symbols of U.S. imperialism, such as military and corporate offices, in the late 1970s and '80s. Having already been sentenced to decades in prison, the Ohio 7 were further prosecuted by the Reagan and Bush Senior administrations under ""seditious conspiracy"" laws as part of an attempt to criminalize leftist political activity. The government spent over $10 million but failed to win a conviction--a victory for the working class and for all who would oppose the policies of the capitalist rulers. The Ohio 7's Jaan Laaman recalled: ""Lynne truly was fearless and could not be intimidated by prosecutors, judges or FBI and other gun-toting goons.""

With such a bio, Lynne found herself directly in the state's crosshairs. In February 2005, she was convicted of material support to terrorism and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government for her vigorous legal defense of Egyptian fundamentalist Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who had been convicted for an alleged plot to blow up New York City landmarks in the early 1990s. The purported ""material support"" was communicating her client's views to Reuters news service. The ""fraud"" was running afoul of Special Administrative Measures imposed by the Clinton administration that stripped prisoners of basic rights, including the ability to communicate with the outside world and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Her Arabic interpreter Mohamed Yousry and paralegal Ahmed Abdel Sattar were also convicted. As we wrote in ""Outrage! Lynne Stewart, Mohamed Yousry, Ahmed Abdel Sattar Convicted"" (WV No. 842, 18 February 2005):

""The verdict gives the government a green light to prosecute lawyers for the alleged crimes of their clients, thereby shooting the basic right to counsel to hell.... If nobody can get a lawyer to zealously defend him from prosecution, then fundamental liberties, from the right to a trial and an attorney, to even the right of free speech and assembly, are choked.""

The George W. Bush administration made Lynne Stewart's prosecution a centerpiece of the bogus ""war on terror,"" having seized on the September 11 attacks to greatly enhance ""anti-terror"" measures enacted by Democratic president Bill Clinton. Indeed, she and her codefendants were convicted under Clinton's 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.

Judge John Koeltl, who praised Lynne for representing ""the poor, the disadvantaged and the unpopular,"" gave her a 28-month sentence, far less than what the prosecution demanded. Outraged by such ""leniency,"" the government went to extraordinary lengths to appeal. At the instigation of the Obama administration, a ruling by a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals directed Koeltl to resentence her to ten years of hard time. On 15 July 2010, Koeltl complied.

We noted at the time that this was intended to be a death sentence for Lynne, who was suffering from Stage IV breast cancer. In prison she was taken to chemotherapy treatments in leg irons and handcuffs shackled to a chain around her waist; the weight of the chains was so heavy that guards had to essentially carry her from her cell to the prison hospital. In December 2010, she was transferred to the federal women's prison in Carswell, Texas, far from family and supporters. Lynne was being brutally punished for nothing other than standing up to the U.S. government.

It was through the Spartacist League and Partisan Defense Committee's work in publicizing and rallying to the defense of Lynne Stewart and her codefendants that we came to know and work with her and Ralph, who had differences with our Marxist views. The two of them later became regular honored guests at the PDC's annual Holiday Appeal benefits for class-war prisoners. Not ones to shy away from a good argument, Lynne and Ralph were quite happy to tweak our noses at the Holiday Appeals and get theirs tweaked in return. With a shared commitment to the fight for solidarity with victims of capitalist state repression, our mutual respect grew as we engaged in political debate.

Lynne's political principles included not throwing her codefendants under the bus for her own interests. At a Lynne Stewart Defense Committee meeting following her 2005 conviction, PDC supporters stressed the importance of fighting for freedom for her codefendants, Yousry and Abdel Sattar. Lynne applauded this statement. But the defense committee, run by the National Lawyers Guild, abandoned her codefendants.

Longtime ""movement"" lawyer Liz Fink, who quit the legal team days before Lynne Stewart's resentencing, filed court papers that despicably tried to exonerate her client by framing up Yousry. Fink accused him of conversing in Arabic with the sheik to further the latter's aims--a fabrication that the New York Times (7 March) repeated in its obituary for Lynne Stewart. Lynne rose up in court to disavow her attorney and announced that those were Fink's words, not hers. In fact, Yousry had been writing a PhD thesis on radical Islam in Egypt under the guidance of Near East historian Zachary Lockman, who had advised him to interview the sheik. Yousry's prosecution left his life in ruins.

In greetings read out by Ralph to a PDC Holiday Appeal in January 2011 in NYC, the imprisoned Lynne denounced the chilling effect of Justice Department witchhunting of political opponents, declaring: ""That message once again must be shouted down, first by the resisters who will go to jail and second by us, the movement who must support them by always filling those cold marble courtrooms to show our solidarity and speaking out so that their sacrifice is constantly remembered."" In another letter, she conveyed the deep human solidarity that continued to drive her even under the inhumane conditions of incarceration. She wrote that with the monthly stipend she received as part of the PDC's support to class-war prisoners, she was able to purchase books and, after finishing them, put them into ""circulation"" for other inmates. Lynne also used the stipend to help provide other imprisoned women with items like coffee, peanut butter and shampoo.

In 2013, as Lynne's health precipitously declined, more than 40,000 people signed petitions demanding her release. At the request of her attorney, a medical doctor associated with the PDC meticulously documented how Lynne met all criteria for hospice eligibility by the government's own guidelines. This played a role in procuring her release later that year when the Justice Department, after months of obstruction, finally allowed Koeltl to free her on the grounds of her ""terminal medical condition and very limited life expectancy."" Arriving at LaGuardia airport on New Year's Day 2014, Lynne, who could barely walk, told her supporters, ""I'm going to work for women's group prisoners and for political prisoners."" Being back with her family and back in the struggle literally added years to her life.

In honoring Lynne Stewart, we recognize a hard, effective champion of the oppressed. We salute her lifework, which is an inspiration to those fighting for social justice against the rulers of this racist capitalist society.

In honoring Lynne Stewart, we recognize a hard, effective champion of the oppressed. We salute her lifework, which is an inspiration to those fighting for social justice against the rulers of this racist capitalist society.

The Russian Revolution and the Emancipation of Women

Part One

The Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917 was the greatest victory for the world's working people and for all of the oppressed. The spark for the revolutionary upsurge was a mass outpouring of women in Petrograd on International Women's Day (IWD), March 8 (February 23 by the old Julian calendar). While in recent years bourgeois feminists have usurped IWD, in fact it is a workers' celebration that originated in 1908 among female needle trades workers in Manhattan.

As part of our celebration of the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution, we reprint below the first part of an article that initially appeared in the Women and Revolution pages of Spartacist (English-language edition) No. 59, Spring 2006. Various reformist outfits, including the International Socialist Organization (ISO) and Socialist Alternative (SAlt), have been issuing their own articles on the Russian Revolution, to which they occasionally pay homage. But this is nothing more than whitewash of their record of spitting on the heritage of the world's first and only successful proletarian socialist revolution.

When capitalist counterrevolution triumphed in the former Soviet Union in 1991-92, following decades of Stalinist misrule, these organizations reveled in the final undoing of the workers state. The virulently anti-Soviet ISO echoed its British cothinkers, whose paper cheered, ""Communism Has Collapsed"" and declared that this was ""a fact that should have every socialist rejoicing"" (Socialist Worker [Britain], 31 August 1991). For its part, SAlt's cothinkers headlined in their Russian newspaper, Rabochaya Demokratiya (October 1991), that ""Where We Were"" was ""On the Barricades in Moscow,"" i.e., on the side of Boris Yeltsin's imperialist-backed counterrevolution.

In stark contrast, the International Communist League fought in defense of the Soviet Union and its social gains, calling for proletarian political revolution against the Stalinist bureaucracy. Today, we uniquely uphold the program for new October Revolutions, the only program that will lay the basis for the full emancipation of women and the liberation of all humanity in a world communist society.

""'Liberation' is an historical and not a mental act, and it is brought about by historical conditions, the development of industry, commerce, agriculture, the conditions of intercourse.""

--Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The German Ideology (1846)

Today, millions of women even in the advanced capitalist ""democracies"" endure nasty and brutish lives of misery and drudgery. In the United States, to name just two instances of anti-woman bigotry, abortion rights are under increasing attack and quality childcare is scarce and too costly for most working women. Conditions for women in the Third World are worse by orders of magnitude. But even 15 years ago women in the Soviet Union enjoyed many advantages, such as state-supported childcare institutions, full abortion rights, access to a wide range of trades and professions, and a large degree of economic equality with their male co-workers--in short, a status in some ways far in advance of capitalist societies today.

The 1917 Bolshevik Revolution made these gains possible. No mere cosmetic gloss on the surface, the Russian Revolution was, in the words of historian Richard Stites, a

""classical social revolution--a process not an event, a phenomenon that cannot be fused, triggered, or set off by a mere turnover of power which confines itself to the center and confines its efforts to decrees and laws enunciating the principles of equality. True social revolution in an underdeveloped society does not end with the reshuffling of property any more than it does with the reshuffling of portfolios; it is the result of social mobilization. Put in plain terms, it means bodies moving out among the people with well-laid plans, skills, and revolutionary euphoria; it means teaching, pushing, prodding, cajoling the stubborn, the ignorant, and the backward by means of the supreme component of all radical propaganda: the message and the conviction that revolution is relevant to everyday life.""

--Stites, The Women's Liberation Movement in Russia: Feminism, Nihilism, and Bolshevism, 1860-1930 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978)

This thoroughgoing effort to remake society was made possible by the smashing of tsarist/capitalist rule and the Bolshevik-led seizure of power by the soviets--workers and peasants councils--in October 1917. The estates of the landed nobility were abolished and the land nationalized; industry was soon collectivized. The new workers state took the first steps toward planning the economy in the interests of the toilers. This brought enormous gains to working women. The Russian Revolution sought to bring women into full participation in economic, social and political life.

Since the counterrevolution that restored capitalism in 1991-92, women in the ex-Soviet Union face vastly worse conditions somewhat akin to the Third World. Massive unemployment, a plummeting life expectancy, and a resurgence of religious backwardness--both Russian Orthodox and Muslim--are just three examples. From 1991 to 1997 gross domestic product fell by over 80 percent; according to official (understated) statistics, capital investment dropped over 90 percent. By the middle of the decade, 40 percent of the population of the Russian Federation was living below the official poverty line and a further 36 percent only a little above it. Millions were starving.

Women's Liberation and World Socialist Revolution

The Bolsheviks recognized that without qualitative economic development, the liberation of women was a utopian fantasy. Working to maximize the resources at hand, the early Bolshevik regime did all it could to implement the promise of women's emancipation, including the formation of a party department that addressed women's needs, the Zhenotdel. But at every step their efforts were confronted with the fact that short of a massive infusion of resources, the results were limited on all sides. Leon Trotsky, the leader together with V.I. Lenin of the Russian Revolution, explained that from the beginning the Bolsheviks recognized that

""The real resources of the state did not correspond to the plans and intentions of the Communist Party. You cannot 'abolish' the family; you have to replace it. The actual liberation of women is unrealizable on a basis of 'generalized want.' Experience soon proved this austere truth which Marx had formulated eighty years before.""

--The Revolution Betrayed (1936)

The grim poverty of the world's first workers state began with the economic and social backwardness inherited from the old tsarist empire. Foreign investment had built modern factories in the major cities, creating a compact, powerful proletariat that was able to make the revolution in a majority-peasant country. The revolutionary workers were, in most cases, only one or two generations removed from the peasantry. The workers supported their cousins in the countryside when they seized the landed estates and divided up the land among those who worked it. The alliance (smychka) between the workers and peasants was key to the success of the revolution. But the mass of peasant smallholders was also a reservoir of social and economic backwardness. The devastation wrought by World War I was compounded by the bloody Civil War (1918-1920) that the Bolshevik government had to fight against the armies of counterrevolution and imperialist intervention, throwing the country's economy back decades. The imperialists also instituted an economic blockade, isolating the Soviet Union from the world economy and world division of labor.

Marxists have always understood that the material abundance necessary to uproot class society and its attendant oppressions can only come from the highest level of technology and science based on an internationally planned economy. The economic devastation and isolation of the Soviet workers state led to strong material pressures toward bureaucratization. In the last years of his life, Lenin, often in alliance with Trotsky, waged a series of battles in the party against the political manifestations of the bureaucratic pressures. The Bolsheviks knew that socialism could only be built on a worldwide basis, and they fought to extend the revolution internationally, especially to the advanced capitalist economies of Europe; the idea that socialism could be built in a single country was a later perversion introduced as part of the justification for the bureaucratic degeneration of the revolution.

In early 1924 a bureaucratic caste under Stalin came to dominate the Soviet Communist Party and state. Thus, the equality of women as envisioned by the Bolsheviks never fully came about. The Stalinist bureaucracy abandoned the fight for international revolution and so besmirched the great ideals of communism with bureaucratic distortions and lies that, in the end in 1991-92, the working class did not fight against the revolution's undoing and the restoration of capitalism under Boris Yeltsin.

The Russian Revolution marked the beginning of a great wave of revolutionary struggle that swept the world in opposition to the carnage of WWI. The October Revolution was a powerful inspiration to the working class internationally. Germany, the most powerful and most advanced capitalist country in Europe, was thrown into a revolutionary situation in 1918-19; much of the rest of the continent was in turmoil. The Bolsheviks threw a good deal of the Soviet state's resources into the fight for world socialist revolution, creating the Communist International (CI) for this purpose. But the young parties of the CI in Europe had only recently broken from the reformist leadership of the mass workers organizations that had supported their own bourgeois governments in WWI and were not able to act as revolutionary vanguard parties comparable to the Bolsheviks. The reformist, pro-capitalist and deeply chauvinist leadership of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) was able to suppress the proletarian revolutionary opportunity in Germany in 1918-19, with the active collaboration of the military/police forces.

Social-democratic parties like the German SPD and the British Labour Party bear central historical responsibility for the degeneration of the Russian Revolution. Yet they howl along with their capitalist masters that the early Bolshevik regime under Lenin inevitably led to Stalinist despotism, that communism has failed and that capitalist ""democracy"" is infinitely preferable to communism. They are echoed by many of today's leftist-minded youth, who equate communism with the Stalinist degeneration of the Soviet workers state. Anarchist-influenced youth hold that hierarchy is inherently oppressive, that small-scale production, decentralization and ""living liberated"" on an individual basis offer a way forward. This is a dead end.

Despite the triumph of the bureaucratic caste in 1924 and the consequent degeneration of the Russian Revolution, the central gains of the revolution--embodied in the overthrow of capitalist property relations and the establishment of a planned economy--remained. These gains were apparent, for example, in the material position of women. That is why we of the International Communist League, standing on the heritage of Trotsky's Left Opposition, which fought against Stalin and the degeneration of the revolution, stood for the unconditional military defense of the Soviet Union against imperialist attack and an intransigent fight against all threats of capitalist counterrevolution, internal or external. At the same time we understood that the bureaucratic caste at the top was a mortal threat to the continued existence of the workers state. We called for a political revolution in the USSR to oust the bureaucracy, to restore soviet workers democracy and to pursue the fight for the international proletarian revolution necessary to build socialism.

Heritage of Bolshevik Work Among Women

A host of books published over the last decade and a half speak to the enormous gains made by women in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution. The Bolsheviks immediately began to put into place civil law that swept away centuries of property law and male privilege. Wendy Goldman's valuable Women, the State and Revolution: Soviet Family Policy and Social Life, 1917-1936 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993) focuses on the three Family Codes of 1918, 1926 and 1936 as turning points in Soviet policy, serving as markers for the party and state program on the woman question. The 1918 Code, the ""most progressive family legislation the world had ever seen,"" gave way to the 1926 Code, which came into effect in a period of intense political struggle between the Stalinist bureaucracy and oppositional currents arrayed against it, centrally Trotsky's Left Opposition. The 1936 Family Code, which rehabilitated the family in official Stalinist ideology and made abortion illegal, codified the wholesale retreat under Stalin in the struggle for women's equality.

Goldman's book is only one among many publications since 1991 that have profited from the increased access to archives of the former Soviet Union. Another, Barbara Evans Clements' Bolshevik Women (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997) is a group biography, centering on selected longtime party members. Clements has assembled a database of several hundred Old Bolshevik (party members before 1917) women cadre, which she analyzes for trends in origins, education and party activity.

Bolshevik Women focuses on prominent party members such as Elena Stasova, a Central Committee member and the CC secretary in Petrograd in 1917. Another is Evgeniia Bosh, described by Victor Serge (a one-time member of the Left Opposition who later broke with Trotsky) as one of ""the most capable military leaders to emerge at this early stage"" of the Civil War (quoted in Clements, Bolshevik Women). Bosh committed suicide in January 1925 when the Stalin faction purged Trotsky as People's Commissar for War. Yet another was Lenin's close friend and collaborator, Inessa Armand, the first head of the Zhenotdel until her death in 1920.

Less well known are Konkordiia Samoilova, another longtime party cadre, whose work after 1917 focused on Zhenotdel field activities; Klavdiia Nikolaeva, removed as head of the Zhenotdel in 1925 due to her support to the anti-bureaucratic Opposition; Rozaliia Zemliachka, who became a stalwart bureaucrat and the only woman to sit on the Council of People's Commissars under Stalin; and Alexandra Artiukhina, who headed the Zhenotdel from 1925 until its liquidation by Stalin in 1930.

The International Communist League's work among women stands on the traditions established by Lenin's Bolsheviks. Some of the earliest issues of Women and Revolution published original research on the Russian Revolution and Bolshevik work among women by Dale Ross, W&amp;R's first editor, based on her PhD dissertation, The Role of the Women of Petrograd in War, Revolution and Counter-Revolution, 1914-1921 (1973). The second and third issues of W&amp;R (September-October 1971 and May 1972) published in two parts the Bolsheviks' ""Methods of Work Among the Women of the Communist Party"" from the Third Congress of the Communist International (1921). [A new English translation of this document, ""Theses on Methods and Forms of Work of the Communist Parties Among Women,"" was published in Spartacist No. 62, Spring 2011.]The new information available has further confirmed and enriched our solidarity with the Bolshevik road to the emancipation of women.

Subsequent issues of W&amp;R explored other aspects of the fight for women's liberation in the USSR. Of special significance is ""Early Bolshevik Work Among Women of the Soviet East"" (W&amp;R No. 12, Summer 1976). This article detailed the heroic efforts of the Bolshevik government to transform conditions for the hideously oppressed women of Muslim Central Asia, where Zhenotdel activists themselves took to the veil in order to reach these secluded women. It is beyond the scope of the present article to deal with this important subject.

Marxism vs. Feminism

For Marxists, the special oppression of women originates in class society itself and can only be rooted out through the destruction of private property in the means of production. The entry of women into the proletariat opens the way to liberation: their position at the point of production gives them the social power, along with their male co-workers, to change the capitalist system and lay the basis for women's social independence from the confines of the institution of the family. Marxism differs from feminism centrally over the question of the main division in society: feminists hold that it is men vs. women; for Marxists, it is class, that is, exploiter vs. exploited. A working woman has more in common with her male co-workers than with a female boss, and the emancipation of women is the task of the working class as a whole.

The Marxist view of the family as the main source of the oppression of women dates from The German Ideology, where Marx and Engels first formulated the concept that the family was not an immutable, timeless institution, but a social relation subject to historical change. In the classic Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State (1884), Engels (working with the material available at the time) traced the origin of the institution of the family and the state to the division of society into classes. With the rise of a social surplus beyond basic subsistence, a leisured, ruling class could develop based on a private appropriation of that surplus, thus moving human society away from the primitive egalitarianism of the Stone Age. The centrality of the family flowed from its role in the inheritance of property, which required women's sexual monogamy and social subordination. Engels termed this ""the world historical defeat of the female sex.""

A collectivized, planned economy seeks to productively employ all adults with the goal of maximizing the wealth, including leisure time, available to all. In contrast, in the boom-bust cycle of a capitalist economy, each capitalist enterprise seeks to maximize its rate of profit. Inevitably, capitalist firms seek to reduce costs (and increase profits) by reducing both wages and jobs, leading to an impoverished working class, a pool of chronically unemployed workers and long hours for those who do work. Isolated in the family, women make up a large component of the reserve army of the unemployed, hired during economic booms and sent ""back to the kitchen"" during hard times. When women are drawn into the workforce in great numbers, the capitalists then try to reduce real wages for men, so that it takes the income of two working adults to raise a family.

The necessary role of the family--the function that must be replaced and cannot be abolished--is the rearing of the next generation. Under capitalism, the masses of youth are slated for wage slavery and service as cannon fodder in the bourgeois army, and the family plays an important role in training them to obey authority. It is also a major source for inculcating religious backwardness as an ideological brake on social consciousness.

While many aspects of the capitalist system serve to undermine and erode the family (the employment of women and public education are two examples), capitalism cannot provide a systematic solution to the double burden women shoulder, and must seek to bolster its weakened institution. Bourgeois feminists, whose quarrel with the capitalist system is their own subordinate status within it, address this by arguing for a redivision of household tasks within the family, increasing men's share of domestic responsibilities. Marxists seek to transfer housework altogether to the public sphere. As the Bolshevik leader Evgeny Preobrazhensky (later allied with Trotsky) said, ""Our task does not consist of striving for justice in the division of labor between the sexes. Our task is to free men and women from petty household labor"" (quoted in Goldman, Women, the State and Revolution). Thus one of the tasks of the socialist revolution is the full replacement of the institution of the family with communal childcare, dining halls and laundries, and paid maternity leave, free health care, and special efforts to draw women fully into social and political life.

In Russia, the feminist movement was part of a broader bourgeois-democratic current that opposed tsarism and wanted to modernize Russia as an industrial capitalist society. For example, in 1906 amid the continuing ferment of the first Russian Revolution, the three main feminist organizations, the Women's Equal Rights Union, the Women's Progressive Party and the Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, directed their efforts toward the passage of equal rights and woman suffrage bills in the newly established Duma (parliament). When the predominantly liberal First and Second Dumas were dissolved by the autocracy, the Russian feminist movement went into decline.

In 1917 the main ""women's issue"" in the eyes of the working woman was opposition to the bloody imperialist war that had been raging for three years. The war sparked the February revolt, which began with the mass outpouring of women on International Women's Day. After the abdication of the Tsar and the establishment of the bourgeois-democratic Provisional Government, most of the ostensible parties of the left and of reform--including the Russian feminists--considered the main goals of the revolution to have been accomplished. Therefore, they abandoned their opposition to the war and supported the renewal of the imperialist slaughter in the name of ""democracy.""

The Bolsheviks fought for the soviets of workers and peasants deputies to become organs of the rule of the exploited and oppressed, including women, and to end the war immediately without annexations of other countries. The best fighters for women's liberation were the Bolsheviks, who understood that the liberation of women cannot be isolated from the liberation of the working class as a whole. Nor can it be fully achieved, least of all in a backward country--even one with a revolutionary government--in political, social and economic isolation from the rest of the world.

Courageous Radical Lawyer Lynne Stewart 1939-2017,"https://archive.is/CXQ5I

Workers Vanguard No. 1108 24 March 2017

Courageous Radical Lawyer

Lynne Stewart

1939-2017

Radical attorney Lynne Stewart died in Brooklyn on March 7 at the age of 77. The immediate cause was a series of strokes which, together with metastasized breast cancer, finally drained the life out of this tireless fighter for the oppressed. Lynne's death will be keenly felt by the incarcerated opponents of the U.S. government, for whom she fought until the end. Without her, the world is a lonelier, crueler place for these prisoners and their families. We offer our condolences to Lynne's husband, Ralph Poynter, and her entire family.

Born in Brooklyn and raised in Queens, New York, the young Lynne Stewart worked as a librarian in an all-black school in Harlem, developing her political consciousness through direct exposure to and confrontation with the entrenched racism of this society. She went on to law school at Rutgers. A proponent of 1960s New Left radicalism, Lynne dedicated herself to linking struggles of those in the outside world with those behind bars, fighting to keep militant leftists and others reviled by the capitalist state out of the clutches of its prison system.

Paying tribute to the work of Lynne and Ralph, class-war prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal noted that they fought for decades for such groups as the Black Panthers and the Puerto Rican Young Lords, ""but mostly, they fought for the freedom of the poor and dispossessed of New York's Black and Brown ghettoes."" One of her most prominent cases was the defense of Larry Davis, a young black man in the Bronx who in November 1986 shot his way out of a murderous siege by cops and then became a folk hero for escaping an enormous manhunt for more than two weeks. With Lynne Stewart and William Kunstler arguing Davis's right to self-defense, in November 1988 he was acquitted of the attempted murder of nine police officers. This stunning legal victory on behalf of victims of racist NYPD terror made Lynne a marked woman in the eyes of the state.

Lynne was also part of the legal team for the Ohio 7, who were prosecuted for their roles in a radical group that took credit for bank ""expropriations"" and bombings of symbols of U.S. imperialism, such as military and corporate offices, in the late 1970s and '80s. Having already been sentenced to decades in prison, the Ohio 7 were further prosecuted by the Reagan and Bush Senior administrations under ""seditious conspiracy"" laws as part of an attempt to criminalize leftist political activity. The government spent over $10 million but failed to win a conviction--a victory for the working class and for all who would oppose the policies of the capitalist rulers. The Ohio 7's Jaan Laaman recalled: ""Lynne truly was fearless and could not be intimidated by prosecutors, judges or FBI and other gun-toting goons.""

With such a bio, Lynne found herself directly in the state's crosshairs. In February 2005, she was convicted of material support to terrorism and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government for her vigorous legal defense of Egyptian fundamentalist Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who had been convicted for an alleged plot to blow up New York City landmarks in the early 1990s. The purported ""material support"" was communicating her client's views to Reuters news service. The ""fraud"" was running afoul of Special Administrative Measures imposed by the Clinton administration that stripped prisoners of basic rights, including the ability to communicate with the outside world and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Her Arabic interpreter Mohamed Yousry and paralegal Ahmed Abdel Sattar were also convicted. As we wrote in ""Outrage! Lynne Stewart, Mohamed Yousry, Ahmed Abdel Sattar Convicted"" (WV No. 842, 18 February 2005):

""The verdict gives the government a green light to prosecute lawyers for the alleged crimes of their clients, thereby shooting the basic right to counsel to hell.... If nobody can get a lawyer to zealously defend him from prosecution, then fundamental liberties, from the right to a trial and an attorney, to even the right of free speech and assembly, are choked.""

The George W. Bush administration made Lynne Stewart's prosecution a centerpiece of the bogus ""war on terror,"" having seized on the September 11 attacks to greatly enhance ""anti-terror"" measures enacted by Democratic president Bill Clinton. Indeed, she and her codefendants were convicted under Clinton's 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.

Judge John Koeltl, who praised Lynne for representing ""the poor, the disadvantaged and the unpopular,"" gave her a 28-month sentence, far less than what the prosecution demanded. Outraged by such ""leniency,"" the government went to extraordinary lengths to appeal. At the instigation of the Obama administration, a ruling by a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals directed Koeltl to resentence her to ten years of hard time. On 15 July 2010, Koeltl complied.

We noted at the time that this was intended to be a death sentence for Lynne, who was suffering from Stage IV breast cancer. In prison she was taken to chemotherapy treatments in leg irons and handcuffs shackled to a chain around her waist; the weight of the chains was so heavy that guards had to essentially carry her from her cell to the prison hospital. In December 2010, she was transferred to the federal women's prison in Carswell, Texas, far from family and supporters. Lynne was being brutally punished for nothing other than standing up to the U.S. government.

It was through the Spartacist League and Partisan Defense Committee's work in publicizing and rallying to the defense of Lynne Stewart and her codefendants that we came to know and work with her and Ralph, who had differences with our Marxist views. The two of them later became regular honored guests at the PDC's annual Holiday Appeal benefits for class-war prisoners. Not ones to shy away from a good argument, Lynne and Ralph were quite happy to tweak our noses at the Holiday Appeals and get theirs tweaked in return. With a shared commitment to the fight for solidarity with victims of capitalist state repression, our mutual respect grew as we engaged in political debate.

Lynne's political principles included not throwing her codefendants under the bus for her own interests. At a Lynne Stewart Defense Committee meeting following her 2005 conviction, PDC supporters stressed the importance of fighting for freedom for her codefendants, Yousry and Abdel Sattar. Lynne applauded this statement. But the defense committee, run by the National Lawyers Guild, abandoned her codefendants.

Longtime ""movement"" lawyer Liz Fink, who quit the legal team days before Lynne Stewart's resentencing, filed court papers that despicably tried to exonerate her client by framing up Yousry. Fink accused him of conversing in Arabic with the sheik to further the latter's aims--a fabrication that the New York Times (7 March) repeated in its obituary for Lynne Stewart. Lynne rose up in court to disavow her attorney and announced that those were Fink's words, not hers. In fact, Yousry had been writing a PhD thesis on radical Islam in Egypt under the guidance of Near East historian Zachary Lockman, who had advised him to interview the sheik. Yousry's prosecution left his life in ruins.

In greetings read out by Ralph to a PDC Holiday Appeal in January 2011 in NYC, the imprisoned Lynne denounced the chilling effect of Justice Department witchhunting of political opponents, declaring: ""That message once again must be shouted down, first by the resisters who will go to jail and second by us, the movement who must support them by always filling those cold marble courtrooms to show our solidarity and speaking out so that their sacrifice is constantly remembered."" In another letter, she conveyed the deep human solidarity that continued to drive her even under the inhumane conditions of incarceration. She wrote that with the monthly stipend she received as part of the PDC's support to class-war prisoners, she was able to purchase books and, after finishing them, put them into ""circulation"" for other inmates. Lynne also used the stipend to help provide other imprisoned women with items like coffee, peanut butter and shampoo.

In 2013, as Lynne's health precipitously declined, more than 40,000 people signed petitions demanding her release. At the request of her attorney, a medical doctor associated with the PDC meticulously documented how Lynne met all criteria for hospice eligibility by the government's own guidelines. This played a role in procuring her release later that year when the Justice Department, after months of obstruction, finally allowed Koeltl to free her on the grounds of her ""terminal medical condition and very limited life expectancy."" Arriving at LaGuardia airport on New Year's Day 2014, Lynne, who could barely walk, told her supporters, ""I'm going to work for women's group prisoners and for political prisoners."" Being back with her family and back in the struggle literally added years to her life.

In honoring Lynne Stewart, we recognize a hard, effective champion of the oppressed. We salute her lifework, which is an inspiration to those fighting for social justice against the rulers of this racist capitalist society.

DISCUSSION: Batman v Superman Theatrical Cut Analysis,"So, I feel that the theatrical edition is actually marginally better than the ultimate edition, helped by a shorter run time, and I have a very long, winding analysis to show my thoughts on it, and how it portrays everything needed. Good luck getting to the end! 

I've talked a lot about scene transitions, because I know one of the main complaints against this cut, is that the editing is sloppy, but to me the choice of scenes makes sense, and I hope to illustrate that below. 

Bruce’s opening monologue, refers to himself as “fallen”, establishes his character’ radical departure. Running from the truth. Falls, world upside down. Falls further. Perfect things (pearls) fall. Bats “save” young Bruce. The light they lift him towards is a lie. Batman is a lie, and Bruce is fallen.

Scene transition: Kryptonian attack is Bruce “seeing” the lie.

Destruction from ground level. Establish personal connection to victims. Only Superman is seen entering and exiting the building. Heat vision established to witnesses. Bruce running towards the destruction signifies selflessness. Keefe established loss. Girl Bruce saves reminds him of his own parents demise. Superman is the instrument of this tragedy to Bruce and seeing him fuels his rage. Wayne Logo on the ground. Wayne is now fallen.

Scene transition: Cut from the attack to the world engine which played a part in it.

Recover bit of terraformed earth. Someone looking for samples. Green rock. Superman’s weakness (We don’t know this yet)

Scene transition: Cut to Lois Lane, Superman’s other weakness, on the job.

US is paying for contractors, and the drones (both sides of the war). CIA presence and tracker suggests they don’t know about the funding. Ignorance is not the same as innocence (Just because Superman didn’t know about the deaths during black zero, it doesn’t mean he isn’t responsible). Contractors act to put Lois in danger and make superman seem complicit in deaths. General is shaking when Superman appears. 

Scene transition: Survivor describing the aftermath of the attack

Superman is deemed responsible due to his interference. The view is that he answers to nobody, and that is unacceptable.

Scene transition: Cut to Lois, one of the few people he does answer to.

Discovers bullet, is traumatised by events, shaking, water = cleansing, hence bath. Clark home, flowers. Loves Lois (going to surprise her with cooking, smiles as soon as he sees her). Clark says he doesn’t care, he didn’t kill those men. Lois hides the bullet because she knows when she’s in danger, it means Clark might make a mistake. Cost to saving her. Can superman be superman with a girlfriend?  Clark tries to cheer Lois up.

Scene transition: Clark’s love life juxtaposed with Bruce’s abusive relationship with Batman.

Cops scared when they see batarrang. Victims are also scared. Trafficker is branded. Cops react shocked.

Scene transition: Branding is a new low for Bruce, cuts to descending even further in a lift.

Bruce is interested in one of the contractors at the desert. Bruce after White Portuguese because they’re brining a powerful weapon. New rules. Alfred knows something is up. Superman has made Bruce feel inadequate, angry, powerless, turned cruel.

Scene transition: Cut to Clark, the reason Bruce has turned cruel

Clark introduced to Batman’s activities and his disregard for life. Troubled by his disregard for the law.

Scene transition: Cut to senators who are troubled by Superman’s lack of oversight meeting Lex.

Lex’s dad grew up in Soviet Germany. Poor. Wave flowers at tyrants. Sets up immediate dislike of anyone with power and their potential to become a tyrant. Set up Kryptonite’s capabilities. We know it was Lex’s man at the Indian ocean. Lex spells out he wants the kryptonite for planetary security as a deterrent against superman, in the event he should become tyrannical. Says “Superman” with dislike, introduce meta humans, others like him. Need to defend against them too. Mock’s Finch’s accent, clearly dislikes her for not seeing a deterrent as necessary.

Scene transition: Cut to newspaper clippings of people who depended on the kindness of Lex’s “monster” (Superman), and then keefe, who was on the other side of that kindness.

Keefe uses Superman to lift himself up, and then defiles the statue because he blames him.

Scene transition: Crime of vandalism cuts to Lois talking to Crime Lab and main character reactions.

False God, Clark is troubled by this. So is Lois. Jenny isn’t happy either. They’re ignorant. 

Scene transition: Cut from Clark questioning the consequences of him helping, to senator helping Lex (Which will have big consequences).

Establish Lex’s newly acquired access to Kryptonian technology. Wants Zod’s body for weapon testing. At some point, he will notice he needs fingerprints to access scoutship. Senator eating out the palm of Lex’s hand.

Scene transition: Battle of wills to battle of fists.

Bruce gets closer to the info he wants. Good luck for one is brother’s misfortune. Actions have consequences.

Scene transition: Cut from Bruce on the job to Clark talking about Batman’s methods.

Clark cares about Batman’s victims. Wants to help them with coverage as opposed to sport. Lois gets caught up in journalism, accidentlly reveals to Clark she has the bullet. 

Scene transition: Lois bargaining for a decent seat on a plane, to Lex’s luxurious dwelling.

Magical thinking of orphan boys. Lex cracks and tries to unnerve senator Finch when she blocks the weapon. He believes she is foolish for choosing hearings over a weapon. Lex doesn’t like human contact. Oldest lie in America. Finch sees Lex as he really is. Doesn’t want Superman dead, Lex does. Lex spells out he sees Superman as a devil. 

Scene transition: Devils come from the sky, cut to world engine sound.

World engine haunts Bruce’s nightmares. Its his greatest failure. He never got over the death of his mother, that is where Batman stems from. The Bat is devouring him.
Women and alcohol to numb the pain.

Scene transition: Secretary Swanwick washing his hands, ridding himself of dirt whereas Bruce clings to it.

Lois has balls. Swanwick spells out Superman’s lack of oversight resulted in deaths. It was his fault, regardless of whether or not he meant it. Ignorance is not the same as innocence. 

Scene transition: Talking about rogue heroes, cut to the other.

Learn Lex is involved with the White Portuguese. Alfred tries to convince Bruce he doesn’t need Batman. The need for Bruce to suit up is removed by an invitation, but he still goes and looks at the suit anyway. Batman is consuming Bruce. Defaced Robin suit. Black Zero was not Bruce’s only failure. Ascends upstairs, away from the suit. Wayne Manor is derelict and ruined, just like Bruce.

Scene transition: Bruce arrives at Lex’s residence.

Clark is covering the event as a reporter. Lex puts on a façade in public. Gets nervous. Philanthropist, lover of humanity. Lex feels it is unfair for Prometheus to be punished for sharing the gifts of the gods. (He disapproves of great power being kept). Father couldn’t afford books (Lex was poor).  Knowledge is power. Superman has rendered Lex powerless once again. Clark knows there is more to Bruce due to earpiece. Probes about Batman. Bruce points out Superman is incredibly dangerous so going after Batman seems hypocritical. Clark stops following Bruce to see the news, shows he’s more worried about those people. 

Scene transition: Factory fire on TV to Superman saving someone from the same factory fire.

He’s happy he’s made a difference. Worried when he sees how people revere him. Visual symmetry from Man of Steel in Zod’s dream sequence. The skulls remind Superman of all the people he has failed. Superman is just a guy trying to do the right thing. The media questioning everything he does and his motives is juxtaposed with the people he saves. Finch wants Accountability! Clark is troubled by all of this.

Scene transition: Discussing the consequences of Superman’s actions, cuts to keefe, a literal consequence of superman’s actions. 

Lex is using Keefe to further his Platform against Superman.

Scene transition: Keefe wants Superman to answer for what he’s done, cutting to Clark neglecting work because he wants Batman to answer for what he’s done. “You don’t get to decide what the right thing is”. Clark disagrees with Perry.

Scene transition: Clark’s black and white view of “the right thing”, cuts to sword of Alexander, a king and tyrant who is the result of never questioning his actions.

This scene shows Bruce’s experience, but otherwise it’s purely plot. 

Scene transition: Told where the hard drive is, cuts to the drive being decrypted.

Scene transition: Cut from decrypting a drive with info about a potential nightmare scenario for Bruce, to the world engine sound letting us know we are in Bruce’s literal nightmare.

Earth is toast. Batman has a gun (Desperate times). Superman soldiers show Bruce’s fear of him taking over.  Bruce’s own demons overwhelm him. Superman has become everything Bruce feared. 

Scene transition: Bruce dies in his dream, then wakes up.

Mysterious stranger appears with warnings. Lois lane is the key. Bruce is right about him, fear him (Bruce takes this to mean Superman). Floating papers in mid air showed this actually happened. Wasn’t a dream.

Scene transition: Cut from Bruce’s growing paranoia about Superman to Clark being shown the criminal from earlier is dead as a result of the bat brand. Cuts between them a couple of times.

Scene transition: Discovery that the White Portuguese is a ship cuts to Bruce explaining it to Alfred.

We learn the weapon Bruce is after tis actually kryptonite, and he wants it to kill Superman. Alfred tries to talk Bruce out of it, but “How many good guys are left?”. Everyone falls. Even Bruce.

Scene transition: Talk of ending Superman cut to Clark’s disappearance.

Scene transition: Clark has disappeared to take action, cut to Lois trying to tone for actions in the desert.

Scene transition: Swanwick doesn’t believe Superman is a killer, cuts to unloading of the weapon that can kill him.

Batman has a gun? How far will he go for the kryptonite?  Thank goodness it’s only a tracker. Wait the Batmobile is here too? Bruce wants the kryptonite ASAP, and the tracker is planning ahead for if he doesn’t get it now. Bruce is fallen and cruel. Criminals are like weeds.  Only the kryptonite matters. He’s not going out of his way to ensure the people protecting it are okay. Superman stops Batman’s rampage and isn’t happy as several people have most likely just died, but he doesn’t take it any further, respecting the fact it’s not up to him to do so. This only exacerbates Bruce’s fear and anger.

Scene transition: Bruce is furious, cuts to a damaged batmobile (representing Bruce) descending into the batcave.

Bruce immediately searches for where the Kryptonite has gone. This is all that matters.

Scene transition: Bruce after the kryptonite cuts to Lex observing the convoy has been attacked.

He knows that Batman is desperate for it. Lex has the crate opened to reveal the kryptonite, which is here illegally, and admires the weapon that can kill Superman. 

Scene transition: The weapon cuts to the other means of dealing with Superman, a call to the hearings.

Clark is still troubled and Lois is concerned, while Lex continues to admire the kryptonite, clearly believing the hearings are pointless.

Scene transition: Lex admiring a way to kill superman cuts to Martha Kent saying people fear what they don’t understand.

Superman has gone to his mother for advice, she just wants her son to be happy, letting him know the choice to be Superman is his and his alone.

Scene transition: Superamn doubting himself cuts to Secretary Swanwick revealing the desert was a setup. Someone is deliberately turning the world against Superman.

Bullet revealed to be Lexcorp. Also had contractors at the compound. We realise Lex knows the identity of Superman and his attachment to Lois Lane, which the desert incident was designed to test, with the added benefit of being able to start discrediting superman immediately if Lex was right.

Scene transition: Cut from discovery that Superman was set up to a public event that is a direct result of that setup.

Bruce is watching because he wants to see if Superman will show up. Lex voices his discontent with the deliberate sabotage of a weapon against Superman by Finch. Evidence of tampering with Keefe’s support money being returned every month with antagonistic writing. Martha is watching too, hoping everything is alright. Lex takes a jab at Finch. “You are going to be on the hot seat in there.” “Power can be innocent” Oldest lie in America. People celebrating and protesting Superman, who shows up because he wants to do the right thing. People are in awe and scared of him inside the capitol. Peach tea is Lex’s cruel idea of a joke. Finch realises what has happened before she dies. Lois and Ma Kent are immediately worried and empathetic for Clark. Clark is wretched with himself because he just let all these people die when he was trying to do the right thing. Bruce is furious because yet again, it would appear Superman is implicit in death and destruction that claimed innocent lives during the Black Zero event, the Desert, and now Washington. 

Scene transition: Cut from Bruce shaking with rage to Lex Corp compromised.

Lex is pleased to learn the kryptonite has been taken by Batman.

Scene transition: Cut from Lex being pleased at the results of the bombing to Lois being worried.

Clark didn’t see the bomb. He should have known to be aware, but he wasn’t and people died. He doesn’t think he is capable of being Superman. Painful lesson that Superman’s current black and white vision of the world is wrong. “My world doesn’t exist anymore”.

Scene transition: Lex is proceeding with his plan after the consequences of the bombing have taken their toll.

The only way to rationally explain this part is Lex is an opportunist, and now that he knows he has Batman all riled up, he’s going to see what funky Kryptonian tech he can learn about in order to have some backups.

Scene transition: From Lex preparing to Bruce preparing.

Bruce becomes aware of metahumans. Lex would have invited Bruce to his party knowing that he would try something like copying info. The metahuman files are there to give Bruce new targets if he kills Superman.

Scene transition: Lex’s plan is in full swing. We go from the Batman facet to the Scout ship facet,

Got to be honest, this is where things fall apart slightly. It feels like Lex should have discovered the Kryptonina Archives much earlier in the film as opposed to one scene prior. It would make himknowing what he’s doing more believable.

Scene transition: Nothing special about this one.

Public discontent with superman is spelled out, along with the belief that he was complicit in the bombing by not acting against it.

Scene transition: Cut from burning effigy of Superman to Clark searching for answers.

Has a conversation with Johnathon Kent in his head. Clark internalises the fact that actions will always have unforeseen consequences, and that’s part of being Superman. He learnt the cost of inaction during Man of Steel, now he’s leant the cost of action here.

Scene transition: Clark thinking about his dead father cuts to Bruce thinking about his dead father.

Alfred tries one more time to talk Bruce out of his rage. Bruce’s whole purpose has been redefined by Superman. He needs to kill him, because otherwise, nothing he has done will matter, and he would have failed in his quest for justice spurred by his parent’s death.

Scene transition: Talking of fathers to Clark’s mother.

Kidnapped.

Scene transition: Martha’s kidnap is part of Lex’s plan, now we see Bruce putting his plan to kill Superman into action by setting up the battlefield and luring him with the batsignal.

Scene transition: Batman is ready, cuts to Lex’s plan in answer.

Lois is also kidnapped! (Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little inside plays here)

Scene transition: Lois recognises henchmen and is helicoptered in to meet Luthor.

The straightest path to superman is a pretty little road called Lois Lane. (Not important, just a fun bit of wordplay. Lex has so much of this, its great). Superman is back, now understanding the responsibility of being Superman. By the way, he doesn’t have to be pleaseant to criminals. Lex did just push his girlfriend off a building. Lex spells out his motivation here. His experiences in life have taught him that either Superman is evil because he is all-powerful but does nothing, or he is good, but not all powerful. Either way, he can be killed or revealed to the public for what he truly is. Lex wants people to see the Fraud. Power can not be innocent. 

More evidence for Lex being opportunist here. He discovered Bruce was everything he needed so he just manipulated him slightly, as opposed to finding some other highly trained fighter with the resources and the grudge necessary to take on superman. There’s also evidence for the desert setup being very well thought out here. Lex uses it to determine if Superman will come to the rescue of a loved one or not, on top of everything else, meaning he knows Superman will do what it takes to save his mother and it is safe to continue with his scheme, as opposed to wasting resources. 

I like to think the heat vision eyes here were just to intimidate Lex into telling him where his mother was, but its questionable.

Scene transition: Superman has the threat to his mother revealed, cuts to Ma Kent in an undisclosed warehouse with henchmen.
Okay, from this point on I’m not going to bother pointing out how the scenes transitioning make sense unless its something people haven’t necessarily thought of before.

Activity at the ship adds urgency.

Superman looks disgusted with himself while telling Lois Batman has to die, and I believe this was intended more as Clark thinking out loud rather than saying he would kill Batman. “No one stays good in this world” 2 ways to look at this. Clark comes back from soul searching, finally thinking he knows what it means to be Superman, only to have his faith shattered again. The other is Clark is referring to Bruce, and he now understands why Bruce is so violent, now that the world has torn him down too.

Justice league teasers. I believe their placement can actually be justified as raising the stakes for the Batman Superman showdown. If Bruce kills Superman, do you really think he’s going to stop there? He will hunt the other meta humans, because they’re too powerful. Just like Superman.

Throughout the fight, Bruce is dehumanising Clark (You’re not brave. Men are brave), who has seen enough of Bruce’s actions to know he won’t listen so he tries to subdue him. “Stay down” etc. It then becomes a fight for Clarks’ life when Bruce gasses him. The fight is not filmed to look pleasant or make you cheer. Clark is in pain. You’re supposed to want Bruce to stop. There’s more falling imagery. Bruce decending through the building with Clark at the bottom.

I’m not even going to talk about the Martha scene. You know what it’s supposed to represent. It depends on the individual whether or not they buy that explanation.

I would like to point out this doesn’t mean Bruce has been saved from himself yet. He’s been falling ever further throughout the course of the film and now Superman has stopped his decent, but he has a long way to climb. Bruce’s obsession has shifted from killing Superman to saving Martha. That is all that matters now, hence him not going out the way to if it means some criminals get hurt.

To me, KGBeast not cooking Martha when he realises something is wrong is justified, because, if you were him, would you really want to kill the only leverage you have stopping the most powerful man in existence from potentially throwing you into the sun? He doesn’t know its Batman until its too late.

Lois discards the spear in the pool because she doesn’t trust the man who just tried to skewer her boyfriend. And she also won’t trust the government, as they were involved in covering up the desert incident. Who knows what else they might do?

Its annoying they used the blood of my blood line to show Lex thinks he controls Doomsday, who looks like a cave troll because the made his face into a monstrous version of Michael Shannon, who has a pretty cave trollish brow himself. Doomsday even has the same scar.

As much as I dislike the super lightning storm, it does help establish Doomsday as an uncontainable threat that must be dealt with. 

Superman literally gets beaten over the head with the names of victims from the Black Zero event.

Superman chose to sacrifice himself in order to ensure the nuke hit Doomsday.

Lois knows to go back for the spear because she saw heatvision going everywhere, and assumed Doomsday was Kryptonian. Seriously, you could see it from space. She would have also seen Doomsday laser Batman out the sky.

Batman taking Doomsday to the spear as opposed to the other way around might be justified by him trying to contain Doomsday to an uninhabited area, rather than just letting him wander off wherever.

Superman didn’t give the spear to Wonder Woman because he doesn’t know her, and he’s not the sort of person to make someone else risk their life instead of him.

Fun fact. Zod stabs Jor El with a blade on his right arm. Guess which arm Doomsday uses to stab Superman with?

Superman’s death inspires Bruce to be better. Hence the men are still good speech, and we see the start of his redemption when he refuses to brand Lex. I actually feel its far more affecting to have Superman save Bruce from what would normally be considered beyond the point of no return as opposed to stopping him crossing that line in the first place. It shows Clark has faith in everyone. No matter how far they’ve fallen.

And that’s my very haphazard analysis/defense of the theatrical cut. I would say it’s a solid 6/10, with argument to be made for a 7/10. I also think it works better if we interpret the desert setup to be about Superman being complicit in people killing other people as opposed to getting hung up on the details why people believe Superman killed them with bullets. I know the ultimate edition makes it seem like he used heat vision, but to me, this interpretation feels more in line with the themes of the film. Congratulations if you made it to the end!

Discussion: The Snyderverse may be done after justice league,With the announcement that Joss Whedon has joined the DCEU along with the rumored pursuit of Jordan Peele for flash I believe WB is following through on a course correction. Add in the fact that the only movie scheduled for 2018 is Aquaman who stole the justice league trailer with humour and it seems pretty evident that's what's happening.
