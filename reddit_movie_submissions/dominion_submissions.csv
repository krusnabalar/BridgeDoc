 I didn't buy this keyboard for gaming. I am a college student and I enjoy typing on a mechanical keyboard. I have been using this Keyboard for around a week with my MacBook Pro.

Once I opened the box I was enlightened by the weight of it. Its not too heavy and it's not too light. Seems like the right amount. The build quality is great at this price point. The plastic seems strong and sturdy. I did a flex test and little to no flexing. I haven't taken it apart but it feels like they have a metal plate inside for structural support and what gives this little guy that extra needed weight.

The plastic for the key caps seem a little thin to me. When typing on the keyboard you can feel the quality of the caps. Slightly thicker keys would make this product perfect for me.

The switches are great! I am no expert at all but from what I have read they compare to Cherry MX Blues. These switches are very loud. I live alone so I don't have to worry about disturbing anyone. This switches are of great quality in my opinion. They feels sturdy and they do not seem cheap.

The led lights are great and it makes this keyboard look sexy. Each key has its own led and they are bright enough for everyday use. I do like how you can adjust the brightness of the light or you can just turn them off. I have noticed the LEDs will not stay at your setting once you turn your computer on. You will need to adjust it every time.

Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this keyboard to anyone looking to save a few dollars.

 Glorious and epic
Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2018
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
So I was hesitant to purchase this at first.
I had read some review somewhere on another redragon product, claiming that it was not true mechanical switches, blah blah blah.

I gotta say, this is probably one of the best keyboards I have owned so far.
I don't usually spend a lot on keyboards with the exception of a Razer DeathStalker Ultimate that I had bought one day to use for work (and it worked out perfectly, it literally did like 30% of my job for me lol, but it was $300 so .. IT BETTER :D ).

Back to the keyboard...
I was how they say. FLUUSSSHH WITTHHH CASHHH.
And thought what the hell I'll try one of their ""Mechanical"" keyboards, and if its a flop, then lesson learned...

Once I had the box in my hand I was already impressed.
The box it comes in is nice, and I can tell the product was heavy, which is usually a good sign.
Once I pulled it out, I knew that it was meant to be (that's what she said...)

It is pretty thick (doesn't bother me one bit)
It is heavy, (also doesn't bother me).
And because its heavy, it doesn't go sliding around the desk when I type at my nutty typing speeds.

The build quality is excellent, honestly, I don't know how they are making money because this thing is solid, and I bet I can weaponize it..
There is no bend or give to this thing, its literally like a rock, its a thing of beauty and brings a tear to my eye.

The red glow is intense and clearly visible even under the high-intensity interrogation style lighting they use at my office.
And the ominous red glow looks amazing, it fits my offensive IT role perfectly (I deal mostly in heartbreak, and ""Like A Boss"" situations)

The flip tabs on the bottom are heavy duty, and are super solid, like crazy solid, you flip them back and they sound like someone cocking a gun.
They literally SNAP! into place, I love it, I have been known to break these things off.. That is just not happening with this keyboard..
I think I might just snap them back and forth now if someone comes to bother me in the middle of an intense keyboard bonding session.

The keys themselves are beautifully designed, I love the font, it's not your typical boring look.
This thing says I break all the rules,
And its the type of font you want to send an email with, but know you can't because you will get fired when someone realizes that you've gone beyond their realm of times of new roman, and into a whole new dimension of professionalism...
They are crystal clear, no blemishes, and the glow comes through the keys perfectly, the glow underneath the keys makes it look that much cooler.

The mechanical keys are solid and work exactly as you expect, whether the actuation force is exactly what it should be, I don't know.
But they do the damn job, and I like to use my keyboards, not measure them in a full-on anal manner.
The click is fairly loud and obvious, and there is no volume knob on it, so that is something to consider if you buy a mechanical keyboard for the office.
I feel like this really does give me confidence in my high-speed typing ability as I am no longer wondering if I hit the key I wanted or if my keyboard had a derp moment (cause I don't make mistakes! YOU HEARD ME! {ok sometimes I do}).
I really do blast through my typing though, with ease and a sense of accomplishment ( cause I feel accomplished when I hammer out a memo and it literally feels like I hammered it out... That is mission accomplished right there!)
I am sure there are going to be moments when someone asks me questions whilst I am typing, and I am just going to keep slamming away while staring at them as I give them the look of ""I know what I am doing"", while confident clicking noises radiate from the dominion that is my office.

My boss came in and just immediately went wow mode on it, he loves it and stated that it makes him want to get rid of his laptop and switch to a desktop just to have a badass keyboard like this one.
I didn't mention that he could just hook it up to his laptop (MUAHAHAHA)
And thus my reign over awesome keyboards stays unchallenged (as planned).

Overall this thing is solid, and it makes a statement.
It says, now mechanical keyboards can now be owned by anyone and not just those who are less impulsive with their money.
I love it and I am going to buy 2 more, one for home (or should I call it my lair o.0) and one for my coming Mad (IT) Scientist Lab.

To the manufacture: good job on an excellent product!
I honestly didn't have confidence in your brand when I first made this purchase, I have never used your products but now I am a believer.
And don't change the price, I am still a cheap impulsive bastard and will have to panhandle if you do.

 An ACTUAL Mechanical Keyboard.
Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2016
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
Lets keep this review short and simple, You want a mechanical Keyboard, you can't really afford a mechanical keyboard, but hey this one is only a few bucks more than a similar membrane keyboard? why not this one?

Pros :
It's cheap AF. seriously, $30? that's like 6 pumpkin spice lattes.
It's actually mechanical, not like mechanical feel keyboards, you do actually get that sweet sweet clickity clack!
Backlit! Not only is it mechanical it's actually backlit too! and it's not too bright, just right, easy to see even with the monitor right infront of it.
Raised keys, a simple little touch, but makes the keyboard look that much better.

Now onto the cons:
There aren't that many cons really, at this price point it's bettery tactile wise than literally every keyboard out there, due to the fact it is an actual mechanical keyboard.
But the only real Con that I can find is that it says the switches used are a Cherry Green Equivalent, but they're not. They're a Cherry MX Blue clone if even that, a real cherry MX Green has about 70grams of actuation force, this keyboard has 55grams. I measured using quarters, it took 10 quarters to make the switch depress. But more on these switches, they say that they're Greetech switches, however I can't find the same or similar switches anywhere online! These switches might be a knock off of a knock off.....

but lets be honest, it's a $40 mechanical keyboard. that's actually mechanical. The only thing that would make this better, would be, slightly larger keys, I don't have little child hands. and possibly a wrist rest, but honestly? This keyboard is an incredible value and I would highly recommend it!

How do I play this Danger deck?,"I blindly made this Danger! deck I found because it seemed fun, played a few matches and somewhat understood the mechanism.
What I don't understand is the best combos / the best cards to end my turn on, and when to summon specific Extra Deck monsters (or what some of these even do tbh). Would appreciate anyone who could help me with this.

(suggestions on card changes would also be awesome)

Deck list:

1x Cyber Stein
3x Broww, Huntsman of Dark World
3x Snoww, Unlight of Dark World
1x Gokipole
2x Danger! Jackalope? 
3x Danger!? Tsuchinoko?
1x Armageddon Knight
1x Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite
1x Fairy Tail - Snow
3x Danger! Chupacabra!
3x Danger! Mothman!
1x Shaddoll Beast
3x Danger! Nessie!
3x Danger! Bigfoot!
1x Danger! Ogopogo!

1x Card Destruction
2x Pot of Avarice
2x Dark World Dealings
2x Beginning of the End
3x Magical Hats (no idea why this is in here)

 I didn't buy this keyboard for gaming. I am a college student and I enjoy typing on a mechanical keyboard. I have been using this Keyboard for around a week with my MacBook Pro.

Once I opened the box I was enlightened by the weight of it. Its not too heavy and it's not too light. Seems like the right amount. The build quality is great at this price point. The plastic seems strong and sturdy. I did a flex test and little to no flexing. I haven't taken it apart but it feels like they have a metal plate inside for structural support and what gives this little guy that extra needed weight.

The plastic for the key caps seem a little thin to me. When typing on the keyboard you can feel the quality of the caps. Slightly thicker keys would make this product perfect for me.

The switches are great! I am no expert at all but from what I have read they compare to Cherry MX Blues. These switches are very loud. I live alone so I don't have to worry about disturbing anyone. This switches are of great quality in my opinion. They feels sturdy and they do not seem cheap.

The led lights are great and it makes this keyboard look sexy. Each key has its own led and they are bright enough for everyday use. I do like how you can adjust the brightness of the light or you can just turn them off. I have noticed the LEDs will not stay at your setting once you turn your computer on. You will need to adjust it every time.

Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this keyboard to anyone looking to save a few dollars.

 Glorious and epic
Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2018

So I was hesitant to purchase this at first.
I had read some review somewhere on another redragon product, claiming that it was not true mechanical switches, blah blah blah.

I gotta say, this is probably one of the best keyboards I have owned so far.
I don't usually spend a lot on keyboards with the exception of a Razer DeathStalker Ultimate that I had bought one day to use for work (and it worked out perfectly, it literally did like 30% of my job for me lol, but it was $300 so .. IT BETTER :D ).

Back to the keyboard...
I was how they say. FLUUSSSHH WITTHHH CASHHH.
And thought what the hell I'll try one of their ""Mechanical"" keyboards, and if its a flop, then lesson learned...

Once I had the box in my hand I was already impressed.
The box it comes in is nice, and I can tell the product was heavy, which is usually a good sign.
Once I pulled it out, I knew that it was meant to be (that's what she said...)

It is pretty thick (doesn't bother me one bit)
It is heavy, (also doesn't bother me).
And because its heavy, it doesn't go sliding around the desk when I type at my nutty typing speeds.

The build quality is excellent, honestly, I don't know how they are making money because this thing is solid, and I bet I can weaponize it..
There is no bend or give to this thing, its literally like a rock, its a thing of beauty and brings a tear to my eye.

The red glow is intense and clearly visible even under the high-intensity interrogation style lighting they use at my office.
And the ominous red glow looks amazing, it fits my offensive IT role perfectly (I deal mostly in heartbreak, and ""Like A Boss"" situations)

The flip tabs on the bottom are heavy duty, and are super solid, like crazy solid, you flip them back and they sound like someone cocking a gun.
They literally SNAP! into place, I love it, I have been known to break these things off.. That is just not happening with this keyboard..
I think I might just snap them back and forth now if someone comes to bother me in the middle of an intense keyboard bonding session.

The keys themselves are beautifully designed, I love the font, it's not your typical boring look.
This thing says I break all the rules,
And its the type of font you want to send an email with, but know you can't because you will get fired when someone realizes that you've gone beyond their realm of times of new roman, and into a whole new dimension of professionalism...
They are crystal clear, no blemishes, and the glow comes through the keys perfectly, the glow underneath the keys makes it look that much cooler.

The mechanical keys are solid and work exactly as you expect, whether the actuation force is exactly what it should be, I don't know.
But they do the damn job, and I like to use my keyboards, not measure them in a full-on anal manner.
The click is fairly loud and obvious, and there is no volume knob on it, so that is something to consider if you buy a mechanical keyboard for the office.
I feel like this really does give me confidence in my high-speed typing ability as I am no longer wondering if I hit the key I wanted or if my keyboard had a derp moment (cause I don't make mistakes! YOU HEARD ME! {ok sometimes I do}).
I really do blast through my typing though, with ease and a sense of accomplishment ( cause I feel accomplished when I hammer out a memo and it literally feels like I hammered it out... That is mission accomplished right there!)
I am sure there are going to be moments when someone asks me questions whilst I am typing, and I am just going to keep slamming away while staring at them as I give them the look of ""I know what I am doing"", while confident clicking noises radiate from the dominion that is my office.

My boss came in and just immediately went wow mode on it, he loves it and stated that it makes him want to get rid of his laptop and switch to a desktop just to have a badass keyboard like this one.
I didn't mention that he could just hook it up to his laptop (MUAHAHAHA)
And thus my reign over awesome keyboards stays unchallenged (as planned).

Overall this thing is solid, and it makes a statement.
It says, now mechanical keyboards can now be owned by anyone and not just those who are less impulsive with their money.
I love it and I am going to buy 2 more, one for home (or should I call it my lair o.0) and one for my coming Mad (IT) Scientist Lab.

To the manufacture: good job on an excellent product!
I honestly didn't have confidence in your brand when I first made this purchase, I have never used your products but now I am a believer.
And don't change the price, I am still a cheap impulsive bastard and will have to panhandle if you do.

 An ACTUAL Mechanical Keyboard.
Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2016
Color: BlackVerified Purchase
Lets keep this review short and simple, You want a mechanical Keyboard, you can't really afford a mechanical keyboard, but hey this one is only a few bucks more than a similar membrane keyboard? why not this one?

Pros :
It's cheap AF. seriously, $30? that's like 6 pumpkin spice lattes.
It's actually mechanical, not like mechanical feel keyboards, you do actually get that sweet sweet clickity clack!
Backlit! Not only is it mechanical it's actually backlit too! and it's not too bright, just right, easy to see even with the monitor right infront of it.
Raised keys, a simple little touch, but makes the keyboard look that much better.

Now onto the cons:
There aren't that many cons really, at this price point it's bettery tactile wise than literally every keyboard out there, due to the fact it is an actual mechanical keyboard.
But the only real Con that I can find is that it says the switches used are a Cherry Green Equivalent, but they're not. They're a Cherry MX Blue clone if even that, a real cherry MX Green has about 70grams of actuation force, this keyboard has 55grams. I measured using quarters, it took 10 quarters to make the switch depress. But more on these switches, they say that they're Greetech switches, however I can't find the same or similar switches anywhere online! These switches might be a knock off of a knock off.....

but lets be honest, it's a $40 mechanical keyboard. that's actually mechanical. The only thing that would make this better, would be, slightly larger keys, I don't have little child hands. and possibly a wrist rest, but honestly? This keyboard is an incredible value and I would highly recommend it!

Hello! Welcome to this Chaos Lightsworn decklist for the February 2022 format. With Fairy Tail - Snow and Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson no longer banned, these cards have added more extenders to the deck. Obviously, the deck's plays are based on what is milled, so I cannot provide any specific combos. Instead, I've provided some very basic tips on how to play this deck.

# Tips

* The combos should always start off with going into either Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon, Minerva, the Exalted Lightsworn, or Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion to mill as many cards as possible. This will allow getting everything in the graveyard.
* When you banish 3 light monsters to summon Chaos Dragon Levianeer, also banish Chaos Valkyrie too. Activate Chaos Dragon Levianeer as chain link 1 and Chaos Valkyrie as chain link 2. Since chain links resolve backward, use Chaos Valkyrie as chain link 2 to send Archlord Kristya from the deck to the graveyard, then use Chaos Dragon Levianeer as chain link 1 to special summon Archlord Kristya from the graveyard.
* If siding in Knightmare Gryphon, also side in one of the continuous trap cards (Crackdown, Summon Limit, Anti-Spell Fragrance, Royal Decree, etc.). That specific continuous trap card can be sent to the graveyard by being milled or Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion. Then link summon into Knightmare Gryphon to set that card directly from the graveyard.",yugioh,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/sp8vv9/chaos_lightsworn_deck_list_tips_for_the_february/,Rate/Fix,Muphenz,sp8vv9,/r/yugioh/comments/sp8vv9/chaos_lightsworn_deck_list_tips_for_the_february/,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/sp8vv9/chaos_lightsworn_deck_list_tips_for_the_february/,7,2022-02-10

Regarding the Dominion Series Events,"I saw a lot of accusations in the comments of the post about the disqualified players. Accusations that are not based on evidence but rather on what some members of the community heard. That's nothing more than hearsay. 

In my opinion the mods should make a post collecting all the official and confirmed information and take a stance against throwing around untenable accusations and against witch hunts. Something that already started on Twitch yesterday.

Esperienza come attivista con Anonymous for the Voiceless,"Mi è stato segnalato che potrebbe essere interessante parlare della mia esperienza come attivista per strada con [AV](https://www.anonymousforthevoiceless.org/), in quanto interagire di persona con dei passanti è di sicuro diverso dal discutere con i propri conoscenti od online. La prima bozza di questo testo si è trasformata in un papiro che si perdeva in dettagli poco interessanti, quindi mi limiterò a riportare i punti chiave per poi rispondere ad eventuali domande nei commenti.

#####Cubo della Verità

È il principale metodo di attivismo di AV. Degli attivisti vestiti di nero che indossano maschere di Guy Fawkes formano un quadrato rivolto verso l’esterno, tenendo televisori/portatili che riproducono filmati provenienti da macelli, allevamenti e attività simili ([Dominion]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko) è un buon esempio del tipo di video). A questi si aggiungono altri attivisti a volto scoperto, esterni al cubo, che interagiscono individualmente con i passanti che si fermano a guardare i video, cercando di intavolare discussioni e spingerli verso la scelta vegana.

#####Il metodo

Già solo mostrare i video ha un suo perché, visto che la maggior parte della gente non sa/non vuole sapere da dove vengono *davvero* i prodotti che consumano, ma la massima efficacia sia ha parlando con chi si ferma a guardare. L’approccio standard consiste nell’utilizzare il metodo socratico, ossia ascoltando e ponendo domande (in tono sempre cordiale, mai accusatorio) per far sì che le persone si “freghino da sole”, trovandosi costrette a dover risolvere la contraddizione tra quello che affermano di ritenere giusto e quello che poi effettivamente fanno. In questo modo l’accusa allo stile di vita proviene da loro stessi (quindi non scatta la protezione dell’ego) e implicitamente riconoscono che è il consumo di prodotti animali a dover essere difeso, non l’astensione. Preciso che la posizione di AV è antispecista e abolizionista, quindi la discussione verte sempre sulla morale: le argomentazioni ecologiste e salutiste sono grasso che cola, ma non il cavallo di battaglia (eccetto “non muori se non mangi la carne”, che almeno dalle mie parti è una convinzione diffusa).

#####Contro

I pro sono abbastanza ovvi (rendersi parte attiva del cambiamento, imparare cose nuove, conoscere persone con vedute simili,…), ma ovviamente non tutto è rose e fiori. Il metodo non è perfetto: la maggior parte della gente non si ferma a guardare (sarò sincero, neanche io l’avrei fatto ai tempi) e non tutti i passanti sono cordiali, provocando o insultando gli attivisti; allo stesso tempo non potrai mai avere la certezza matematica che le persone con cui hai avuto una conversazione positiva effettivamente decidano di diventare vegane. Anche tra i volontari si possono trovare tutti i tipi di persone: ci sono quelli che mantengono sempre la calma e hanno la risposta pronta a tutto, e quelli che si mettono a parlare di complotti/pseudoscienze e urlano alla gente, facendo più danni che altro; fortunatamente questi ultimi restano una minoranza, ma nel caso il gruppo della propria città non dovesse soddisfare i propri standard si può sempre tentare con quello della città limitrofa (il vantaggio della struttura a capitoli).

Di sicuro ho dato per scontate un sacco di cose che magari da fuori non lo sono, quindi chiedete pure se qualcosa dovesse interessarvi!",veganita,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganita/comments/sp7j28/esperienza_come_attivista_con_anonymous_for_the/,Attivismo,mpteenth,sp7j28,/r/veganita/comments/sp7j28/esperienza_come_attivista_con_anonymous_for_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/veganita/comments/sp7j28/esperienza_come_attivista_con_anonymous_for_the/,13,2022-02-10

"I am a Dunmer refugee in Skyrim during the fourth era, ask me anything.","[Created with approval from the moderation team. Intended to provide an interesting means of fielding questions and to give a ""first hand"" account of life.]

Good day. My name is Elvasea Andrano, and I live in the province of Skyrim during the 4th Era.
This is a time of bubbling anger and disruption.
The Aldmeri Dominion has defeated the Empire, and as a concession to peace, Talos has been stricken from the Temple of the Eight.

Though I am a native of Skyrim who hasn't stepped foot in Morrowind, I can tell you much of Dunmeri customs and my ancestral homeland, as well as House Redoran. My father Berela was a savant in service to the Great House and as well read as he was, he passed much information down to me.

I'm very happy to ask any questions you may have. Ask me anything!

"#115 Here are several facts that form the foundation of the Gospel, most of which are confirmed in the New Testament, when we accept the straightforward and obvious meaning of the text","Previous Post - [We must listen to the advice of Aleksandar Solzhenitsyn](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDaySaints/comments/sieau0/114_we_must_listen_to_the_advice_of_aleksandar/)

• God created all of the different kinds of creatures *ex nihilo* in six days or less for mankind. 

• Adam was created before Eve, who was formed from Adam’s side. 

• God created a perfectly harmonious world for Adam and Eve. There was no human sickness, death, disease, harmful mutations or man-harming natural disasters prior to the Fall. 

• With the creation of Adam and Eve on the sixth day, God finished His work of creating new kinds of creatures and instituted the order of providence which has continued to this day. (The creation of human souls at the moment of creation is not the creation of a new kind of creature. Human nature is essentially the same today as it was in the beginning.)  

• Prior to the Original Sin, all of nature was under the dominion of Adam and Eve and was subservient to them. 

• Original Sin brought human death, disease, harmful mutations, and man-harming natural disasters in the world. 

• There was a global flood in Noah’s day which killed all of the people and animals on the earth except for those on Noah’s ark. 

• Early man was physically and mentally, superior to modern man. The patriarchs lived to the long ages ascribed to them. 

• All of the basic language-families complete were instantaneously created by God during the Tower of the Babel incident—except for the original language of mankind. 

• God became man to atone for the sins of mankind and to restore the original holiness and harmony of the first-created world. 

 • Through His Passion, death, and resurrection Our Lord Jesus Christ atoned for the sins of the whole world. Then He founded the Holy Church, sent the Holy Spirit upon Her, and gave St. Peter and the Apostles and their delegates and successors the power to transform them into the perfect likeness of Christ through prayer, the sacraments, and acts of love, so that they could share eternal life with Him. 

• Through the work of the Holy Spirit in and through the Church, God will restore all things in Christ, things in Heaven and things on earth.

My arsenal designs so far.,"Most of these are based around what I've dubbed Doomspire, mostly using dominion parts.

With the dual blades, we have Mempo.

After that, Verdant Angel, those missile wings are great but only useful in open areas.

Doomspire V1 -Blaster, with all that beam energy.

Doomspire V2 - Striker Configuration, focusing around multi-range combat.

Doomspire V3 - Shrike, mostly focusing on missiles with basic close-range firepower. 

Doomspire V4-Volt, pure energy config. 

Doomspire V5 - Razorwing, Acid/Bazooka is a great combo. 

Doomspire V0 - Prototype

Dragon V1- All the fire and acid.

Roughneck V1 Primary.

Roughneck V2 Secondary

Gunslinger Prototype

New Jurassic World Dominion Lego Sets revealed!,"https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/two-new-lego-jurassic-world-dominion-sets-revealed-for-april-2022/ 

My thoughts:

- I’m not a huge fan of the Triceratops set, it’ll be nice to get the Triceratops in a cheaper set but I think they could’ve remodelled the head and used it for a Nasutoceratops.
- The Pyroraptor and Dilo set is a must buy for me, that Pyroraptor looks awesome and the truck + minifigure selection is great too!

Royal standard for a British-colonized Argentinian dominion,"&amp;#x200B;

I found this flag while perusing DeviantArt and thought it looked cool, so I remade it at a larger size. My understanding is that the flag comes from an alternate history scenario where the British successfully took control of La Plata and the region evolved in a Canada-style situation. The link to the original DeviantArt post is below.

 The conclusion of the trilogy is being treated as the end of a story by tying it to the original films in a big way. The film stars Mamoudou Athie, Scott Haze, Daniella Pineda, Campbell Scott, Justice Smith, DeWanda Wise, BD Wong, and Dichen Lachman. The sequel is set to arrive in theaters on June 10 and will feature the main characters from the first two films.

I’m really happy right now,"I posted a leak a while back for dominion that seemed legit. Saying they were phasing out the classic dinosaurs in favor of the new ones and that it made retcons to things like hammond not actually caring about the dinosaurs and things like that. I was not a happy camper

Turns out it was bullshit. It got multiple things wrong that the trailer showed. It said dilophosaurus wasn’t in the movie at all, you know who we see in the trailer?

There was another leak that predicted things like that giant locust swarm that’s actually a very key plot point.

How to prevent the Dominion of Canada from getting ass-whacked by the CSA?,"So it's 1943, I'm playing as Germany, and I finally start to break through the Russian Frontline and encircle all the divisions in the Caucasus; however, the game, looking to screw me over in one way or another, decided to have the CSA (Recent winners of the ACW) join the 3rd International and declare war on the Reichpackt and Entente. I thought Canada might be able to hold on for a bit, but they immediately started to crumble to pieces. I can't spare any divisions either because they are all holding one front line or another. My only one saving grace is that I have completely blockaded the west coast with my navy; however, I don't think that accomplishes much when the east coast is wide open.

The Next Lego Game After the Skywalker Saga,"From the beginning from when it was announced the new Indiana Jones Movie which was also the last one seemed like the perfect game that would come after because of it’s release for 2022. The delay made the idea tough after that because nothing would come to mind unless it would be a completely new idea that TT games hasn’t came up yet. Now a new idea has risen from the new Jurassic World Domination Trailer that just came out recently which is also officially releasing in June 10th of 2022. It would be a perfect idea of doing this as the next game for many reasons. These reasons are TT games exploring bigger open world like we saw from the Skywalker Saga which the Jurassic  universe has in general, on top of that details in the trailer show it being the end of the Jurassic Era. This could only conclude me to believe that this new game would be The Jurassic World Trilogy because of the fact that it’s the end of the Jurassic Era for this universe and is moving onto a completely new environment we can see within the future. Evidence to prove this further is the fact that this was seen very similarly to the Skywalker Saga which is releasing in the upcoming months here. We saw that DC Villains released the same year The Last Skywalker film and shortly after TT games did announce that the full story for Star Wars would be making it’s way. As strong as this idea may be for Jurassic World one other idea has came into contact which could make it’s way for how loved the idea is by the community. I’m referring to The Marvel Infinity Saga which has been a big idea for a while now and could make it’s way since a game like Marvel hasn’t popped up in 5 years now. Degrading evidence to the Jurassic World Lego release would be TT games has already mentioned after the Skywalker Saga releases new news to the next Lego game will be revealed. Jurassic World Dominion releases June and Skywalker Saga comes out April which means unless they wait till sometime around June or past to reveal the news The Marvel Infinity Saga is very possible. Other new series never seen before could be capable but TT games has seen to be listening to the community lately similar to wanting the Skywalker Saga which just makes this all the more possible. We’ll have to see but this is all I could think of for now.",legogaming,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/sqci2q/the_next_lego_game_after_the_skywalker_saga/,Discussion,KoolTKat,sqci2q,/r/legogaming/comments/sqci2q/the_next_lego_game_after_the_skywalker_saga/,https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/sqci2q/the_next_lego_game_after_the_skywalker_saga/,8,2022-02-11
Ten Forward weekly 2/10/22,"* Terran bundle will be revealed this Sunday.
* No plans announced for turning the new bridges into player bridges, though Kael is beating the drum to have it done.
* There might be top hats on things coming in the future, but Kael can't mention what it is, only that it might not happen for being too outside the normal aesthetic of Star Trek, which many of the devs are protective of
* Cryptic is looking into the black box ship explosions.
* Other recruitment events will return this year. Delta is already on the schedule to get blogs. Andre has plans to rerun the recruits every year.
* No plans to make new recruitment events for Romulan or Discovery captains any time soon.
* Cryptic is looking into getting DSC captains be Delta or Temporal Recruit, though not actual work has been put into that.
* There is news, but none Kael can share, about DSC Andorian captains
* Kael does believes that the uniform in the Terran bundle is the inquisitor uniform, but he hasn't seen it so don't quote him on that
* Kael has asked about getting the golden Grand Nagus ship put out as part of giveaways and such, but has been shot down because of the negative reaction to the ship's initial release which has caused the devs to be wary on it. Asks twitch chat if if was hypothetically put up for sale/as a give away would people riot to want to get it.
* The Zhat Vash and Far From Home lockbox contents will be put in the infinity box, Kael isn't sure when.
* No update on Dilex fixes. Kael thinks a really good idea came up on Noah's stream recently, and he passed the idea along, but Kael isn't sure anything is going to come of that quickly.
* Kael doesn't know if they will ever go back and add more races to the Dominion faction. He wants to, but they would have to rewrite the story for it to make sense.
* Terran faction unlikely since not too many people really like playing the badguy.
* New ships in the bundle are not legendary ships, but they will have their own stats.
* Kael will ask about getting the Borg parts from Mirror Janeway's made available if they aren't already.
* Cryptic wants to do Prodigy stuff but has to see if they need permission from Nickelodeon to do so/hasn't gotten said permission yet.
* Cryptic studios is fully remote now, so much of the team has left the area of the old offices and now live in Texas or the East Coast.
* Cryptic made something to allow console players to look at their ships closer/better, but it broke like 15 other things so it never came out. They hope to update it soon.
* Kael will ask if DSC Andorian parts, if/when they come out, will be added to 2409 Andorians for use, about the TNG anniversary event being turned back on, about having admiralty/endeavor tokens being added back as free drops.
* STO is going to be 2411 stories for the foreseeable future, rather then trying to directly tie into any of the TV shows.
* Sale of Cryptic to Embracer has finalized.
* Kael believes the actor they want for the Terran Emperor has signed the contract to do it.
* Kael says if you opened the box for Wen's raider HUD before they put in the patch to fix it, and didn't get the costume even after the patch, contact support because they need to know.
* Things like transporter effects are bound to character, so its harder to change them. It may happen at some point in the future.
* The 12th anniversary bundle ships will be made available separately in the zen store except the Mirror Engle which is only available in the way its already available. Mirror Uniforms are exclusive to the bundle. The ships are not legendary. Price will be announced on Sunday.
* Can't custom nameless people on your ship because the bridge map is just a generic map everyone uses and the generic NPCs are just a generic NPC pool not a custom pool for you. Same as a generic map in any mission.
* In response to a chat question, its unlikely past legendary bundles will have their ships broken up into individual sales.
* Cryptic has had a lot of meeting talking about ways to fix the Dilex.",sto,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/spu2mn/ten_forward_weekly_21022/,,TheSajuukKhar,spu2mn,/r/sto/comments/spu2mn/ten_forward_weekly_21022/,https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/spu2mn/ten_forward_weekly_21022/,188,2022-02-11
Sharing/Brainstorming for my LMoP campaign!,"Hey all! I'm running Lost Mines of Phandelver for a group of five newbies and am looking to share what I've come up with as well as hopefully glean some insight from yall! Here is the party and some context for each: (Minor Mentions of Spoilers for that LMoP btw)

A Reanimated Human Barbarian who doesn't remember much of his past. It's been thirty years since he died and has been a mercenary ever since. The PC has largely given me complete control over the reveal of information, with some predetermined information. His overall vibe is a to the point violent man who gets the job done even if he has to get his hands dirty. Sildar is apart of his backstory as a longtime friend and ally who got him the job with the Rockseekers.

A Silver Dragonborn Rogue from off-continent- they were run out of their guild during session 0 when they accidentally discovered their guild master had several members of the guild killed to secure his own power.  He would shortly meet Gundren and Sildar looking for a job to make ends meet now that he's in Faerun.

A Gold Dragonborn Fighter whose clan was wiped out after they invited a strange dragonborn and their human comrades into his home as a child. He takes a job as a guard for Gundren's Wagon after meeting two of the three Rockseeker brothers. This PC is playing up walking the bravery/foolishness line and later plans to become an Eldritch Knight, something I'm keeping in mind. 

A Half-Elf Warlock who's village was destroyed as a child by a bunch of radical humans opposed to the elves' gods. She escaped when fleeing by ""accidentally"" traversing into the Feywilds. Her patron is the Prince of Frost and she had a vision in the Feywilds that foreshadowed danger for the brothers and Phandalin. After some convincing the Rockseekers hired her largely due to Sildar's curiosity as to her insistence on going.

A Human Cleric of Ilmater who was forcefully expelled from his monastery after discovering its possible involvement with the destruction of local villages. He has since joined with the party as a guard after traveling to Neverwinter.

Overall the party dynamic is already very interesting, and the party spent the downtime between turns of truly decimating the goblins in Cragmaw Hideout with a philosophical debate over the value of goblin lives. Ultimately the only goblins that survived were the ones on Yeemik's side, as the cleric parleyed with the goblin to keep the party from fighting on both sides of the cave at once (sneaking did not go as planned). I have some ideas for the grander scale picture after Phandalin (the Players are currently interested in something longterm as long as our schedules allow) so here are some bullets of what I have so far:  


\- The Crimson Hands (I derived the name from the symbol of Ilmater- a pair of white hands with a red cord) are the group directly behind three of the PC's backstories and have spent decades growing from a group of radical clerics to a faction seeking to take control of the sword coast in their ambition to ""save humanity"". I'm thinking these guys see themselves as the heroes and are directly behind the events of the module, using the increased fear of bandits and goblins as an excuse to insert themselves into Phandalin. 

\- One of their agents, the Black Spider (either no longer a drow or perhaps a hired drow mercenary they have full intentions of betraying later) caught wind of the discovery of the lost Forge of Spells and now seeks to waylay the dwarves and the party. The forge would be quite the prize for the faction, as they could supply their agents and soldiers with magical equipment for an even greater edge in their pursuit of dominion over the Sword Coast. I still used goblins for the first encounters because the group certainly doesn't mind utilizing non-humans in their goals, especially if doing so undermines them or plays up to harmful stereotypes of that race. The Redbrands could be Glass-staff's way of buttering up to the Crimson Hands by giving his group a similar name and aesthetic.

\- I know I want to involve Waterdeep and the Rogues Guild at some point for the final two players whose backstories currently don't intersect with any of the other players. Both could feature some fun potential for more political intrigue play and Waterdeep especially could lead to the discovery of the current goals of the Crimson Hand is my current thought. The Rogues Guild will likely be hired on by the Crimson Hands or a third party to go after the PC's.

\- I also want to include the Fae court, so ideas/tips about running the Feywilds will be appreciated! Currently I have an idea about an artifact that was used to create the echo that is the Feywilds, and that being something that the Crimson Hands want. That would be one of their current end goals, to acquire this artifact and create another echo of existence to shunt all non-humans into. Another would be gaining influence in each of the major cities along the coast, either by planting members in the courts or just outright gaining leverage over nobles.

\- I haven't solved the question of where the group is acquiring their divine powers from. There are definitely layman in the order who don't have them, the grunts of the organization. But the higher ups definitely do. One idea I had was that they captured some natural wells of divine power, similar to the necrotic energy that occurs in the Redbrand hideout (I thought that could be a neat bit of worldbuilding I could use) or maybe they captured a life domain god and are somehow stealing its power?

Ultimately I'd appreciate any feedback/criticism/ideas that yall have if you care to spend the time! Thanks much in advance!",DnD,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/sprbs0/sharingbrainstorming_for_my_lmop_campaign/,DMing,RedMage95,sprbs0,/r/DnD/comments/sprbs0/sharingbrainstorming_for_my_lmop_campaign/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/sprbs0/sharingbrainstorming_for_my_lmop_campaign/,2,2022-02-11

Reptilian shapeshifting is physically impossible -- a psientific rebuttal,"## Icke &amp; Wilder

This is an Arizona Wilder interview that is unfortunately conducted by David Icke, the only man crazy enough to take her seriously.

If you hate David Icke, I understand.  Recently he said the coronavirus doesn't exist or something, so now he's radioactive.  Clearly the man is not a biologist.  I think he was a football commentator originally.

I appreciate Icke's fearlessness in taking this interview, especially back then.  That said, I skipped his 37 minute preface.  I am only interested in Wilder's testimony.  Like any journalist, I prefer primary sources.

If you love David Icke, please understand that I have never listened to a word he said, for the same reason as everyone else:  Shapeshifting Reptilians **isn't biologically plausible**.

Even Earth's masters of shapeshifting, such as the octopus, are nowhere near the level required to do a full-time human to reptilian transformation.

It's just insultingly bad sci-fi.  You want a shapeshifter?  The Thing that [tore apart Thule Station](https://thething.fandom.com/wiki/Thule_Station):  Now there's a @\*$% shapeshifter.  Totally implausible, but fun.

It turns out I wasn't thinking sufficiently outside the box.

## Implausible or impossible?

Somehow this week, I stumbled across Wilder's interview.  A year ago, I would've instantly dismissed it.  But a recent esoteric contact has turned my skepticism into urgent investigation.  So I skipped Icke and started watching at 2x speed.

I couldn't turn it off.  The details kept adding up, fitting into what I'd already researched.  There was just one problem:  shapeshifting is impossible… right?  Time for some Sherlock Holmes.

## The damsel in deepest distress

* [David Icke - Revelations, Arizona Wilder (1/2)](https://youtu.be/s9y8weOxrFM?t=2223)
* [David Icke - Revelations, Arizona Wilder (2/2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XC3SQSR1o4)

Haunted eyes tell a tale of murder, witnessed too close.  Her PTSD looks fresh from a warzone.  Her voice bites when she says ""Satan"", with a working familiarity I've never witnessed.  I've snoozed my way through countless phony sermons, but this witch gives me nightmares.  Something bad happened, happens, to her.

The question is, what?  Is her brain fried on psychedelics, depression and domestic abuse, or are there really Reptilian royals?

No, of course the Royal Family are not reptiles.  They are mammals, homo sapiens to be specific.  I believe they may actually be French, so at least that detail is correct.

But Wilder doesn't claim they're reptiles.  She merely states that she's **seen them shapeshift**.

Many people have seen ghosts.  Some have even been touched by them.  Are they all crazy too?  Did all those ancient religions practice human sacrifice for no reason?  Are there hungry ghosts?

## Flesh and illusion

I looked for ways to dismiss the shapeshifting as illusion or psychic projection.  It wasn't possible.  The physical descriptions made clear that the transformation had to be physically real.  Height increased, claws rent, teeth gnashed, maw devoured.  Jesus proved his substantiality to the disciples in the same way:  by eating.  It's a dark miracle.

But dark miracles do occur.  They merely require sufficient power, and a sufficiently powerful practitioner.  A temporary manifestation of a Reptilian ectoplasmic body around a permanently-possessed human host is quite possible, when powered by ritual human sacrifice.  This is the only time Reptilian ""shapeshifting"" can be captured on camera, which lacks the discernment of the mind's eye.

The Emerald Tablets of Thoth say precisely the same thing:  That dark spirits can walk among men, when the blood flows.  That serpent-headed monsters can wear the faces of men, until the illusion is dispelled.  These are two different phenomena, as I will explain.

## Draco dominion

To make sense of Wilder's full testimony requires contextualizing it in Dr. Michael Salla's alternative history of Earth.  Arizona Wilder, despite her title as one of three Illuminati goddesses, is merely a minor figure in one faction out of many, albeit one of the worst.

Wilder's handler is more prominent:  the deservedly-departed Dr. Mengele.  He was as evil as they say, and he continued practicing in the USA for the CIA, but he wasn't quite human.  Certain Aryans of a Merovingian psychic bloodline are compatible hosts for Reptilian possession.

These Merovingians are often redheads, which is no coincidence.  Reptilians are atavistic creatures, predators obsessed with blood.  They associate red scales with dominance, and consider red hair the most delicious prey.  Obviously this has no basis in biological reality, but the Reptilians make it a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Submissive red Reptilians do not survive, and human redheads are bred for tastiness, or psychic ability.

Reptilians are 4th and 5th Density, whereas humans are 3rd and animals are 2nd.  This means Reptilians are psychic and interdimensional, with powers that appear magical to our science.  Draco Alliance and Orion Group Reptilians are Chaotic Negative.  Cut off from God, they sustain their longevity by energy vampirism.  This means feeding on the vital energy of sapient beings, the field that knits body and soul together.  As Reptilians are predators, this takes the form of ritual killing and devouring of terrorized psychic humans, usually children.  Lamb beats mutton.

## Conquest of the West

Open First Contact (OFC) between aliens and this iteration of humanity is still prohibited by government treaties concluded at the end of WW2, in which the USA effectively surrendered to Negatives in order to prevent the panic OFC would cause – such as the collapse of religion, obsoletion of fossil fuels, replacement of the US government by a 4th Reich puppet state, etc.  After Eisenhower refused the offer of the Positive Arianni of protection in exchange for giving up nukes, the Negative New Swabian 4th Reich did flyovers of DC in Haunebu vimana until the USA surrendered.  The effectiveness of the Haunebu had already been demonstrated by their effortless defeat of Byrd's Antarctic invasion fleet.

Notice the curious end of the Age of Exploration after WW2.  The mysteries of the deep ocean, poles and Moon remain unlocked, mankind given mere keyhole glimpses.  The reason:  ""Trespassers will be shot.""

After WW1, the Nazis turned to the Negative Reptilians, pushed into a corner by Communism's rise.  So with Eisenhower's surrender, Draco/Orion Reptilians now ruled the ""free"" West.  Thus explaining why there is no escape for Arizona Wilder, whose tormenters operate with Gestapo (CIA) sanction.

## Ectoplasmic manifestation

David Icke interviews the horror-drowned woman without understanding the mechanics of Reptilian possession.  True shapeshifting is gruesome and rare, a South American rumor.  However, ectoplasmic manifestion is a common paranormal phenomenon.

5th Density beings regularly manifest complete bodies for themselves, with great variability of form.  4th Density beings are much more limited.  Often paranormals use a living human as a source of vital energy to generate ectoplasmic constructs.  This is what occurs in the apparent ""shapeshifting"" that Wilder witnesses during human sacrifices.

The Earth is neither hollow nor solid, but a honeycomb.  Dimensionally-phased vimanas can fly straight through rock, and carve great tunnels of smooth densified walls at comfortable cruising speed.  The lithosphere is the natural redoubt of intelligent life, safe from the vicissitudes that surfacers suffer, sheltered by nothing but thin air.

In certain Reptilian deep subterranean bases, many Negative 4th Density Reptilians float in transparent biogel tubes, while their dark spirits go forth to trouble the minds of men.  ""Possessed"" Illuminati elites have a Reptilian assigned to them full-time.

Probably this task is low-ranking, which is why even the Queen of England transforms into an unassuming brown beast, rather than a royal White, for example.  Reptilians are obsessed with status and royalty, and a royal White Reptilian does live in the Queen's palace, in a dimension just out of sight.  But she lives in luxury, feasting on the hearts of hybrid children, not floating in a darkened tube.

When a scheduled Illuminati ritual occurs, a Reptilian shaman sacrifices a human slave before the biogel tanks, in synchronization with the surface ritual.  This creates a dark portal, through which the shaman may step to the surface.  It also transmits energy, allowing the floater Reptilian to ""shapeshift"" the possessed, building an ectoplasmic Reptilian body around the human host in an instant.  This body is not biologically logical; such constructions do not need to be.  Its only purpose is to facilitate the energy vampirism of the ritual, as the Reptilian rips and devours the blood and organs of the victim.

(Ectoplasm is not really the right term; I use it as analogy to establish the concept of manifesting temporary matter by spiritual energy.)

At this time, the Reptilian can be photographed as a monster, and his teeth and claws are quite real.  At other times, the possessed merely shows flashes of Reptilian influence.  These are not visible on camera, but only in the mind of the acute perceiver, whose latent psi abilities reveal the Reptilian presence riding a human mind.  This is why people often claim to see a flash of Reptilian eyes in an evil elite's face.

This crude trick of transformation is nothing special.  Positive Sasquatch, our long-suffering nature ally, can take the form of Brother Wolf, Brother Bear and Brother Elk at will.  These kind 5th Density shamans put Reptilian tricks to shame, and crush them in combat.  Humans will be even more powerful, once we ascend – something Reptilians very much wish to prevent.

[Bigfoot - Patterson/Gimlin Film | Stabilized | 10/20/1967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q60mSMmhTZU)

Reptilians rarely visit Earth's surface in our dimension; the proliferation of cameras has rendered doing so impractical.  Reptilians can fool the human eye through psi mimicry, because humans are programmed to be easily duped by psi mimicry, so that our ""gods"" may walk among us.  But psi doesn't affect cameras.

Secrecy and lies are essential to the Negative agenda.  The USA, having lost its faith in God, surrendered to a bluff, believing Hell stronger than Heaven.  Butchered children pay the price.

Now you know why the Illuminati insists on calling the rest of us cattle:  Projection.  Their gnosis is nothing more than Reptilian shamanic nonsense, like a goatherd's signals to his herd.

Imperial Alfheimr is under attack.

As it defended itself from the Italian Papacy, it was struck by the vicious Slav. The most hated enemy now 

Several emergency laws have been quickly rushed through the Imperial Council, granting the Aesir supreme and absolute power. The Imperial Government has thus been imbued with what the authority to defend the empire by any means necessary.

The Aesir’s first move was to pass “The Edict of Absolute Autocracy”, which confirmed his unofficial control over the nation. 

Only he would be able to prevent the absolute destruction of the absolute prosperity the Alfr had enjoyed for decades. The hordes of the world would surely converge upon Europe in a bid to rape, pillage, and destroy the beacon of civilization. There would be no bureaucracy, red-tape, or half-measures before the Aesir. 

The Aesir is the state.

Consequently, the Aesir began to direct Alfheimr towards a state of total war. Countless programs would receive temporary budget cuts and taxes would be raised as trillions of marks were directed towards military spending.

Rather than subject his people to the horrors of war, the Alfr will activate the war protocol of the Álfr: Replicant Program. As of right now, there are a total of 36,000,000 civilian units and 4,000,000 combat units throughout the empire. Imperial High Command will designate a total of twenty legions as  production for 2055 and 2056 as the next 8,000,000 units are transitioned into military grade units for the additional cost of $2 million per unit.. 8,000,000 units are prepared for immediate combat. With this being completed as latest as spring of next year, the 2050 series will continue to produce civilian units until otherwise stated. 1,000,000 current units be redirected to completely shore up the defense and construction industries. This will have the effect of shortening emergency military procurement. 

Additional efforts costing nearly $25 billion over 2 years will be taken to expand current Blitzjaeger production lines by 50%, allowing for 144 to roll out of industrial sites per year. Other than that, an estimated 1,000,000 civilian production units will be sent to the Dominion of North America to assist in its transformation. 

_____

Military Procurement

Although less experienced and advanced, the Eastern Union’s military force is far more numerous than Alfheim’s own. This gap widens when looking at recent Bandung Pact military expansion, which would see the military alliance quickly overtaking Alfheim in military strength. 

With Alfheim now in a state of total war, an effort will be attempted to construct as much as possible before a massive confrontation takes place. **Every resource of the state** will be dedicated to the needs of the Wehrmacht.

Right now, the Imperial Armed Forces must prioritize its own defense in Europe. If the war in Europe is lost, then everything will have been for nothing.

Though it hasn’t acted much on it, Imperial High Command has noticed particularly large procurement attempts from the Eastern Union and Bandung Pact. Alfheim’s military is slowly declining to one of the smallest among the great powers. This must change immediately.

##Imperial High Command

###Imperial Fleet

With the acquisition of North America, Alfheim has more or less secured a strategic advance over the Atlantic Ocean. 

Raytheon Technologies

Lockheed Martin

General Dynamics

Bath Iron Works

General Electric

With these companies and many more, Alfheim has secured a vast trove of technological capability and prowess. Despite the stagnation of Washington, America’s sheer advancement will propel Alfheim to the forefront of the world.

In lieu of recent Japanese greed, Russian attacks, and rapid Bandung military expansion, the conquest of America will prove useful to the construction of a new fleet. No longer will Alfheim have its growth limited and its pride insulted by Japan. 

Along with this, Alfheim will also be upping its shipbuilding and holding capacity. Allies in both the Old World and the New World will be asked to lease bases as Alfheim consolidates its global reach. 

The Imperial Space Force will also receive additional space ports as Alfheim prepares to catapult itself to the head of the space race.

With Alfheim slowly passing by pre-collapse states such as the United States of America and the People’s Republic of China, the Imperial Navy will aim to field a total fleet of 300-400 highly-advanced ships of various roles and purposes. 

With the absorption of American systems, all Japanese equipment will be phased out within the decade.

_______

##Naval Infrastructure Scheme

The Imperial Navy of Alfheimr has the potential to be the greatest on the planet. With solid funding, initiative, and hefty reform, it can transition away from its current bloated and unorganized state.

The Naval Infrastructure Scheme will rely heavily on automation and the procurement of advanced technologies. This will be accomplished through a number of factors.

Extensive utilization of replicant units around the clock will completely do away with labor cost and drastically improve efficiency. In total, over 200,000 replicant units will be designated for naval production in various regions. Replicant units will extensively utilize the valkyrie-lite and the alfr mobility walker to significantly improve individual performance. 500 alfr mobility walkers will be allotted for this effort. 

Most importantly, the Naval Infrastructure Scheme will extensively utilize dozens of autonomous spider droids capable of wielding. Geoje Shipyard via Samsung Heavy Industries has remained at the forefront of shipbuilding in the past. [Automation efforts via 68-70% have seen a drastic increase in productivity. Similar methods via Inrotech have also improved manual welding speed](https://www.ship-technology.com/features/feature-the-digital-shipyard-robotics-shipbuilding/). The unison of the two methods, backed by Alfr supercomputer technologies, will allow for better efficiency. 

Naval shipyards will incorporate these plans completely, significantly lowering the amount of time to produce top-of-the-line ships. 


##Sparrows Point Shipyard - Expansion of the Delmarva Canal 

The Imperial Dominion of America is by far the most worthy possession in Imperial Alfr.

Pennsylvania will confirm this with the construction of Sparrow’s Point Naval Shipyard, which is meant to emulate and even exceed Norfolk Naval Shipyard as the largest of its kind in the Americas. 

Not only that, but it will also be Alfheim’s largest dockyard in the New World. Although not necessary due to the logistical sidesteps, it’ll be able to host an over 500 acres of land will be set aside in north Sparrow’s Point. Submarine pen facilities capable of hosting 10-20 of Alfheim’s largest classes will be constructed at Sparrow’s Point, as well as on Delaware coast opposite of the base. Additional dockyards/pins capable of hosting formations of of 5-10 ships will be constructed at Guantanamo, Porto Rico, the Bahamas,  Jamaica, Veracruz, Punta Cana, Barbados, Grenada,  Antigua,  Cosiguina, Cabo San Lucas, Cedros Island, Puerto Vallarta, and Panama City. 

The planned dockyard at Sparrow’s Point will be capable of hosting 50-100 ships of various roles. 

This Naval Infrastructure Scheme will cost $50 billion over 5-6 years, with minor ports being completed in half the time.

big jacob. Mad Dog. (fictional),"&amp;#x200B;

**January 15, 2022 - Nighttime 10:42-11:11 PM**

My wife and I recently moved to College Station. I have lived here before, two years ago I moved up here for my freshman year of college. My college is Texas A&amp;M University and I am studying Mechanical Engineering. I am going to be completely honest here because no one else is going to read this unless you are a therapist, a psychiatrist, or someone in the future looking for something in the past. If you haven’t noticed, I have “delusions”. Well, I don’t think they are delusions, but that may be the point. I feel like I am going off track a lot here. Here is what you need to know, this story won’t be lucid or make a lot of sense, mostly because I am writing this high and possibly slightly drunk. ( I don’t know, drank hours ago and am 175ish pound man at this point). I’ll give backstory as needed, but no full-on origin story yet. 

Anyways, I just took a medium hit off the vape pen while writing this sentence. I start classes in a few days, Hard Classes! You see in high school I was what you call a literal fucking genius. You're going to notice I am quite arrogant. I understand this may be a bad character flaw that people won’t like, but I need to be myself. Anyways, I have failed classes now, a big hit to my confidence. But hey, maybe I shouldn't be too hard on myself, I mean I got married as a freshman in college during a pandemic. Ahhhhh, so much to explain, but we are going to try to stay on fucking track. I am nervous, very anxious about these classes. I want to become like I was in high school and study like a damn robot until I know the information backwards and forwards. I am going to do that, but I just don't want to be who I was then. Unfortunately, that may just be who I am. You see, I am also very anxious. I worry about the scale of my life compared to the scale and vastness of this universe. You know the quote from Jimmy Neutron, “WHy be so smart if it just makes me miserable.” Yeah, well that’s an accurate statement. I am unmedicated and probably highly mentally ill. I am not just saying this for edgelord shit, hell this is an extension of my mind on paper. **I don't talk to people like this, I have a weird feeling about being “special”.** I fear it feeds into my delusions. It's hard for me to admit when I need help because of this “weird arrogance”. Take this, a month ago, early December, my dumbass wakes up and feels sick as a dog. Granted, where I was working at the time made me feel this way, but I am not ready to talk about that yet. Bad habit I know is don't push shit down…. Whatever. Anyway, I stayed home and feel horrible about it because I felt like I could go in…. Turns out I had a 102.9 fever and two strains of the flu. Maybe it was just the stress, but damn was I sick. But I couldn't admit that right then.

Last thing before I close off tonight, my mind feels like it's in constant torment. I mean this and no I am not being dramatic. Ever since I was about 7-8, it has been like this. You will understand why soon. But it hurts, like actually hurts. I want to find the solutions to relieve my mind because the constant influx of Delta 8 and 10 products is not helping anymore. I don't really enjoy the effects unless I am near catatonic. I don't even realize how high I am most of the time because of how used to the state I am in. Only when I am forced to confront reality outside the bubble of this townhouse when high do I realize how fucked up I am actually am. I need help. Maybe this is dramatic, maybe it's not. It's more for someone else like you to decide. But I want to try, I feel like this is going to be a success story. I want what's best.

One more thing, there is someone in my life who holds my heart in her hands: Jean BreAnnah Pope or Jean BreAnnah Green now, but I am progressive so it doesn't really matter. She is tall and beautiful like an amazon. She radiates with pure power and the presence of someone like Wanda Maximoff or Jean Gray. I mean this, she is strikingly beautiful. 5’7”, dark brown eyes and hair. She is slim and curvy. She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen and I knew this from the first time I saw her back at GCHS. 

My name is Jacob Orion Green. I am 21 years old. Right now, I am high and you need to know this to understand this story, you may like me, you may not, you probably won't.

**1/22/22 8:54 PM - 9:42 PM**

I think trauma can be difficult. The statement sounds obvious but I don't think we ever stop and realize what that means. Today, I got crossfaded again and I realize I have more trauma than I let on, mostly because I didn't even realize it. As a child, we are conditioned to believe certain things about our life. The “normalcy” of the situation can make bad things look normal as an adult until you peel back the layers. When I was younger, the life of animals was considered less than important. Now I'm not an animal lover or vegan type, but the empathy we learn is important. Empathy is important. I’ve seen my family take the life of animals in disgusting ways, I didn't realize the effect it would have on my mental state. The more and more I grow up I see almost all the factors that make someone who they are. Take my wife for example, she grew up in a household of pure lunacy and abuse, because of this her mind can be locked to feel certain about something and it causes her a lot of pain…… I'm rambling. TBH, I've had a traumatizing 24ish hours. Whenever my wife gets sick it causes me immense psychological pain. It frustrates me because usually we don't even know what was wrong til later, it just feels out of my control and it makes me angry. But at the same time it makes me angry at her. Part of her health issues are caused by her own stupidity at times. Like she can't eat because she gives herself eating disorders, i try to help but certain times she is just so set in her ways that i know will hurt her that i frustrates me because i now have to feel psychological pain. But it's not her fault, it's her parents. Jean’s parents are three of the dumbest people I know. First, her mother, my MIL is a fucking retard. Yeah I know that's not politically correct to say, but I swear to God the first time I met her I thought she actually had mental issues. Her stepdad Darryl is just the standard “my daddy beat the shit out of me growing up because I showed an ounce of emotion and now I'm republican and don't have common sense or empathy” , he doesn't really bother me. Jean’s parents both know I hate them.. And tbh i think they respect me more for it, not to brag on myself but i've done more for Jean than anyone else on the planet has. Now her biological dad Dejuan, i've never met but he molested her so i want to kill him. I may still be drunk, I'm aware enough to know what I am writing doesn't make any sense but I really don't care at the same time. My mind is a powerful thing, smart enough to figure any equation or problem that it needs too, but at the same time it causes me immense torment. I dont like going back to peel the layers of my childhood to understand why i am fucking crazy. I just wish my mind could give me peace for once, but it is always something. Maybe that's just called being an adult, probably is. I think a lot of people must feel this way, but my “delusions of grandeur” cloud my judgment regularly. But at the same time, they don't. I look back at my wife, she is currently to the side of me in pain, I hope she can sleep and start eating again. I hate when this happens. I just don't understand what the point of all this is, like I get my life has a purpose but the “character development” kinda pisses me off. I mean haven't I proved I can do what I need to do. I can be the perfect student, a good husband for my age, a hard worker doing physical labor with ignorant men. I've proven my point haven't I. I just want peace, equilibrium to just feel in that moment the calming nothingness. But I don't think I can have peace, i dont think it's really in the cards for someone like me. I may be wrong and delusional, but why do I feel like there is so much more I will have to deal with. I want to just be held, but I can't be. I have to be the rock, I have to be the one to suffer so we can continue on. I think I should go drink some more, the only bit of calm I felt was when the high drunkenness took over. Look, to anyone reading this I'm going to try to be more consistent writing, my life is high highs and low lows and I usually only write when I'm low. I just want to be honest in what I say, even if when people analyze this text they say “well, that motherfucker was crazy” I don't care. If I can't find peace, but someone who has a similar life to me can because of writing this, then it's worth it. I'm not a bad guy, I would do anything to help someone and I mean that. I just feel like no one cares about me sometimes except for Jean and my little family. It is sometimes hard to find worth in myself but then i feel like because im “so gifted and intelligent” i have lots of worth. But only for superficial reasons. I want people to like me because they think I have a good heart, I think I do. I know I'm not perfect, but I do care.

New paragraphs because I forgot to do them. I think I'm still more messed up than I thought. I feel kinda zoned out and my mind can't keep a grip on things. My biggest fear is because my mind is so powerful, as I get older it will plunge my mental state into hell. It hurts to be me sometimes…. People aren't going to like me. I'm too privileged to be talking like this. I'm sorry. I'm going to keep writing anyway though. I know this still isn't a fully accurate depiction of who I am yet, but I am getting there. I want to get medicated, but right now i don't think I can really focus on my mental health, I should still try though. But for now, I am going to make another “nuclear screwdriver” and vape that pen until I don't recognize this version of me right now. But maybe I deserve this, I deserve to feel this pain. God people are going to have a field day reading this shit, “Priveldge handsome white boy syndrome: just shut the fuck up”. Or the more accurate is nobody will read this, because i am not nearly as important as my mind thinks i am. 

I guess I just wish if I am suffering, it should mean something in the end, maybe to help someone else. I just hope I get to experience some of that positivity. 

**2/5/22 10:28 PM**

No good deed goes unpunished.

My hardest lesson still I can not learn. Tell me Jacob. Oh so wise one, maybe the girl who steals your heart will steal your mind, life, and sanity as well.

The past fucking five days have been a damn nightmare. No one can know, fucking feel, or even pretend to know what I am dealing with right now. I have watched my beautiful, sensual, soulful, and can’t live without my wife's mind spiraling like crazy. She and the College Stationpolice department are now great friends as they have met with each other multiple times each day until the second ambiance she had been to that day took her to a competent hospital that is keeping her tonight… and until her commitment.

I feel sick. Is it time to cut the cord, to live for myself, to be fucking selfish, but no. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

I fucking love that bitch. But she ruins all my fucking plans, my life on purpose. For it is her reality, I must “understand”. She has lost her fucking mind, playing with shit she cant begin to understand… Gotta pass out.

**2/9/22 9:37 AM**

Youve done more to fuck up my life in the last week then you ever have before. I don't want to abandon you, I love you. I can't even talk to Jean, she isn't even in her right mind currently. Everyone wants me to get a divorce. I am about to have to start the proceedings. This has taken so much out of me, she has , whether willfully or ignorantly, ruined me. I hate what she has done and feel so much guilt for blaming someone who is technically mentally incompotent. But I know her. I know her manipulative sides, her willingness to do anything to survive. She is so fucking selfish. I have given her everything and she has given me nothing. I fear for my life, not the safety of my being. (she did hit me but it didn't hurt) I don't want to hate my wife. But damn, she is making my life miserable in every possible fucking way. This is torment, constant torment. This entire mental health system in Texas  is so fucking stupid. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I want this all to pause, I have so fucking much to do. And more and more and more, I can’t fucking stand this. Like I have fucking lab today and I have to start divorce proceedings. I don't know if I am going to survive this. I really don’t know.

I do not want to divorce my wife. She may be dependent on me, but I feel responsible. I always told her I would take care of her. I made her dependent. I’m losing it. Whether it's my fault or not. I still am hurting. I hurt so fucking much. Jean may not be a great wife, but I love her. I really fucking love her and she helps me in ways I can’t begin to understand. But now I feel like i am being forced into a divorce, but I literally have no fucking choice. She has called me everyday making me miserable. She is half there, half not. I want to fucking die, but I dont. I could and still could have a great life, but Jean is a fucking nightmare. This entire system is a fucking nightmare. WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO!!!!!!!!! 

**2/9/22 - 8:22 PM**

I don't know if I deserved it. But I got a break. I know it sounds cliche and I'm pretty sure it violates a new movie stereotype, but a sweet big black woman saved my ass today. And i do fucking mean saved it. She dropped Physics 2 and got me an easy A course that starts next month. God bless that woman. I mean that. It tells why I am the way I am. I want to help people like she helped me. That's why I had Jean to begin with, and loving her doesn't help things. But also, because of her my Modeling and Manufacturing teacher allowed me the necessary time to complete my assignments. Also, I can just take Physics 2 this summer, along with Cal IV and Differential Equations. Thank you God. If you exist, you meet my anger with blessings. Thank you. Thank you so much. Because I am not perfect, at all. But I am tired.

And I do need to seek counseling. I have a lot of guilt tied to this divorce. I don't want to do it. It makes me sick and filled with dread. But she is quite literally ruining my fucking life. But damn, do I love her. Shes fucking toxically perfect, with the tightest creamiest pussy. Maybe there is something wrong with me, but she is my wife so i dont think it's a sin to describe her that way. And she did help. Well every now and then. I think my immense unconditional love blinded me. It filled me with a false sense of someone caring while also admitting to me how they can't help but sabotage things. **I can't build a life with someone if they are actively destroying it. And that fucking sucks.**

**2/10/22 - 3:19 PM**

It's been a decent day. I try not to think of Jean. But this fucking cat reminds me. It ruined my beanbag, like her owner EMMA is destructive. But I'm not exactly the best owner. I tried calling a few vet hospitals, but it's gonna be like 16  dollars a night to keep her. Hell, I don't have that type of money, I'm not even sure what money I do have. Jean fucked me. But I tried a friend of mine who owns a lot of cats and she gave a little bit of advice. Its just hard, I dont like particualry like the animal, but i dont want it suffer because im a fucking idiot. 

I think I'm getting off the point. I am not even sure if there is one. I know this sounds depressing but I'm actually pretty chill writing it. Kinda just procrastinating. But I really don't have anything to do tonight. I know I know stupid mothafucka. But look im tired, i'm really fucking tired. I don't want to do anything. I think I may be depressed, and I don't think the delta 10 is helping. 

On more positive news, Peacemaker was good. Really like what James Gunn is doing with that shit. I can really only handle a more subdued Gunn, some of his shit gets very very irritating quick, but he's super talented nonetheless and a very necessary force for GOTG and DCEU. Also, DAMN that Jurassic World: Dominion trailer was good. I love Jurassic Park, it's like one of my comfort films. But strangely for all that I claim to love movies, I rarely watch them unless I am drunk or with someone.

I loved being a little drunk and watching movies with Jean. I loved her, I know we had bad habits together. But they were fun. I loved getting high with her, I loved holding her. I just dont even know if anything is gonna be the same. Like intentionally or unintentionally Jean fucked us. Not that she will take any accountability for it, Which won't help my guilt complex. But damn. I mean she isn't great at a lot of stuff, but those good and many many good moments were great, phenomenal even. I could live there forever, but that was the problem. Trying to live in a high, trying to keep it sustainable. It was inevitable and strangely, my extreme earth shattering fear of losing Jean resulted in me holding her tighter these last few months. Gripping her and enjoying those moments like I would never feel them again. I don't know what is going to happen. I'm scared, but also relieved.

Jean is not great. If I did half the shit she did to me I would be considered insane. She was jealous and manipulative. She knows every little word and emotion to hurt me in just the right ways. She even has admitted this. It's like she is proud of her destructive nature. Why the hell am I attracted to 5’3” - 5’8” brunette women? Better yet, who don't have any contact with their biological dad named Micheal. I feel like that fucking Doofensmritz meme, two nickels….. Strange it happened twice… you get the picture. I am high if I haven't guessed, helps my writing tbh, makes me more creative.

I really hope no one hacks my account. They don't need to read any of this, it's just sad and pathetic. Man up Jacob.

**2/11/22 - 3:08 PM - Drunk/High**

So last night my mind drove me to curiosity. A few weeks back, an old friend texted me that he saw me on GRINDR back in December, I was in Abilene apparently. NOW, i was in fact not on Grindr, so apparently someone was using my likeness, well could still be using, to trick people. Whatever, I really don't care.. I think I had to gently turn down my friend without hurting him, pretty good at that. Anyway, I wanted to see how the app was set up so I quickly set up a burner profile with NOTHING on it. Fake name, fame, everything. I SHIT YOU NOT less than two minutes on being on the app someone messaged looking to hookup. I HAD NOTHING ON THERE. Anyways, quickly deleted my profile as quickly as it took to make it and pretended that little enlightening experience didn't happen. 

I don't know even how I would actually try to hook up with people if this divorce goes through. I mean I've always wanted a bigger body count…. But at the same time really dont know if I could have sex with anyone else. My senior year of high school, I was “dating” this girl named Vel. **Velma Rose Green**. You're gonna hear a little bit about her, not so much because I want to write about her, as much as she is unfortunately a member of this story. And I mean unfortunately for a lot of reasons.

Anyway, Velma’s body was literally perfect, I mean like juicy thighs, sweet soft lips, perfect ass, and just overall just an innocent personality. Yeah I know that sounds creepy, but this is unfortunately what I wanted in high school.  I'm not proud of it. I genuinely loved Velma. I wanted to protect her. But I now realize I am more like Nate Jacobs, not really a hero. But Velma wanted to have sex with me. God I wanted her as well. I fantasized about it often, I remember the first time I successfully seduced her. On the back of a church bus, I gripped her body and pulled it into mine. I spooned her and made her feel safe as her hands gripped my hands. We heard something and she was sitting in my lap. I remember running my hands up her thighs and then gripping her pussy. I could fucked her right then, she then grabbed my cock and started jerking me off. I think she was surprised by how big I was….. Yeah. Yeah I know. Judge me. But it was actually a sweet memory I have of her. I loved holding Velma. I loved protecting her. But i realize now how stupid that was. Making excuses for someone because I wanted them to still be innocent. But I'm not even innocent. I hate judging people. I blame it on my religious trauma, but I think one day I'm just gonna have to blame it on myself.

Jean called me twice today through the hospital, it really fucking hurt. You see I might have genuinely loved Velma, but what I feel for Jean is intoxicatingly and infinitely more powerful. And she knows that. I didn't answer the phone when she tried to call early this morning, almost midnight. She called twice today while I was in Walmart. I listened to the voicemail knowing it would break my fucking heart. Shes still crazy, I fucking hate that. I fucking hate that. She’s “Jean” again, but only in name. She said there’s people that remind her of her dad and brother in here. She said she’s scared. But I couldn't get her out, even though I wanted to. I committed to her. I just want to hold her. I just hold her so badly. **I know she is placing the knife in my back, but it feels so good to be drained of life when it comes to her.** I need to go to therapy.",u_bigJacob-MadDOG,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bigJacob-MadDOG/comments/sqalxo/big_jacob_mad_dog_fictional/,,bigJacob-MadDOG,sqalxo,/r/u_bigJacob-MadDOG/comments/sqalxo/big_jacob_mad_dog_fictional/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bigJacob-MadDOG/comments/sqalxo/big_jacob_mad_dog_fictional/,0,2022-02-11

Brainstorm Idea: Turning the Star Trek roleplaying campaigns Shield of Tomorrow and Clear Skies into an animated show a la Amazon’s The Legend of Vox Machina,"Hello!

To those who don’t know, Critical Role, a fun roleplaying group that was formerly affiliated with Geek and Sundry, was taken up by Amazon to turn their D&amp;D adventures into The Legend of Vox Machina – an animated production that has seen a lot of critical success.

Out of Geek and Sundry came a roleplaying scenario based on the Star Trek Adventures RPG system by Modiphius: Shield of Tomorrow, which is the tale of the Interpid-class starship U.S.S. Sally Ride. After that finished, the group migrated over to the channel QueueTimes to do Clear Skies, which follows the journey of the starship U.S.S. Ross.

While these two productions were smaller than the legendary Critical Role, they both were run by passionate Trekkies and have ties to other productions – Star Trek Online added the U.S.S. Sally Ride as an unlockable Admiralty card ([https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/U.S.S.\_Sally\_Ride](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/U.S.S._Sally_Ride)) and the U.S.S. Ross is purchasable as a Legendary Galaxy-class starship variant ([https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary\_Ross\_Command\_Exploration\_Cruiser](https://sto.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_Ross_Command_Exploration_Cruiser)). 

On top of that, Bonnie Gordon, who was the Bajoran Ensign Lark Sage in Shield of Tomorrow and the Caitian Dr. M'Qrell on Clear Skies, is a part of the Kurtzman-era Star Trek shows as the Protostar’s computer on Star Trek: Prodigy: [https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bonnie\_Gordon](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bonnie_Gordon). 

XX

So what do you guys think, especially those who followed these campaigns? I think it would be a good idea for a few reasons:

\-It cashes in on the success of The Legend of Vox Machina as a roleplaying-focused animated show. The reviews are in and there is a market for such things from the masses.

\-It brings more material that line up with the canon of the current timeline. Shield of Tomorrow takes place during the 2370s (Gowron’s declaration of war is mentioned in the plot as well as the destruction of the Odyssey to the Dominion) and Clear Skies takes place a few years after Voyager returns from the Delta Quadrant: the 2380s.

\-It is filled to the brim with passionate Trekkies who did very well in their roles. Side characters can get additional voice actors – something they did with The Legend of Vox Machina.

\-It gives Paramount + more ready-made Star Trek material since the campaigns are done. All that is left is to animate them to bring the tales to life. The fact that the production will be animated can help the live-action shows continue to work as this production is on-screen – no dead time and more Trek on the streaming system.

\-It occupies a unique type of animated show for Kurtzman-era Star Trek – one that is less childish than Prodigy and more serious than Lower Decks. Both campaigns are more in line with the classic Berman-era shows, so more space adventure overall. 

\-The productions already have ties to existing Star Trek products, most notably the MMO Star Trek Online and the officially licensed Star Trek Adventures RPG book. The tie-ins will further increase profit for a multitude of Star Trek products.

All in all, I think it is a win-win for everybody involved.

"Presuming TES VI takes place at a later date than Skyrim, how will the conclusion of the Skyrim civil war play out?","Effectively, do we think Bethesda will declare a winner through lore,

Pull another dragonbreak and say that somehow everyone won (idk maybe ulfric becomes high King of the imperial autonomous zone of Skyrim kinda like morrowinds status in the empire pre argonian invasion. 

Or maybe Bethesda will just leave it vague and claim it doesn't really matter who won as they are functionally the same side when it comes to opposing the third Aldmeri Dominion. 

I kind of hope it's the former. I've never really understood people who cry about the fact that their decisions weren't represented in a games sequel, as obviously there has to be a canonically true storyline to make story telling possible. (At least in most games, TES' view of canon is pretty transient).

whilst I'm an empire supporter, in the event that the Devs chose a stormcloak victory I prefer a concrete story line more than having my players decision to have the empire win represented in the lore just for the sake of it. Makes for far more interesting and immersive stories. 

I'd like to hear other people's thoughts on this.",skyrim,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/spz6ir/presuming_tes_vi_takes_place_at_a_later_date_than/,,Lantimore123,spz6ir,/r/skyrim/comments/spz6ir/presuming_tes_vi_takes_place_at_a_later_date_than/,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/spz6ir/presuming_tes_vi_takes_place_at_a_later_date_than/,10,2022-02-11
"1D to 6D, Explained","There are dimensions of consciousness. There are levels to this. If you’ve ever been in a deep state of meditation, or been hypnotized, or been intoxicated, you’ve felt yourself ascending or descending the ladder of consciousness. These levels are represented by the chakra system, also known as the rainbow bridge.


1D
The first dimension is the Earth Star chakra, or what some call the “Super Root.” It is below our feet, making up the mass of energy known as Earth. After all, that’s what stars and planets are. They’re masses of energy. We are energy, and as living creatures on this planet, we are Earth.

The ancients called this dimension “the Underworld” or the “World Soul.” Carl Jung called it “the collective unconscious.” We are one, and your individual unconscious or Earth Star chakra contributes to the collective, for better or worse. Your individual unconscious is what Freud referred to as “the id.”

Until you do shadow work to reclaim your unconscious emotions, repressed desires, rejected or denied talents, and buried traumas, they’ll all continue to unconsciously motivate your actions and contribute to the darkness of the world.

These talents, desires, and traumas that block self-actualization are often generational, and this chakra is related to ancestors and DNA. Science is now proving we inherit trauma.

It is up to each individual to do the inner work, not only to heal themselves, but also to clear their bloodline and contribute to society in a way that is beneficial rather than harmful. Shadow work is our only hope for a brighter future. However, most people will not do it, hence a pandemic. Repression causes extreme mental, emotional and physical health problems as well as weakened immunity, and science has proven this too.

Fun fact—when mediums speak to your ancestors or deceased loved ones, they’re actually speaking to this unconscious version of YOU. When they say a loved one has crossed over, that means you’ve made peace with an unconscious aspect of yourself that you had in common with the loved one—it is you who has crossed over. Mediums read energetic thought forms that have been repressed, which can “haunt” a traumatized person or physical location where trauma occurred.

Also, when you drink alcohol, you tap into this dimension. Alcohol lowers inhibitions and makes a person’s true nature come out. It makes emotions you’re ashamed of resurface, and leads you to drunk dial your ex you’re only pretending to be over. It can also make you unconscious or “blackout drunk” in a literal sense, and some people choose to not remember things they did the next day because they find it shameful. All repressed memories make up the individual and collective unconscious.

If emotions are represented by the element of water, think of the first dimension as an underwater cave to explore.


2D
The second dimension is the Root chakra, which is the chakra of our basic human needs. This dimension rules the natural world, which is overlapping the man-made world. Both are physical, but only one is eternal while the other is temporary.

Oddly enough, the more spiritual people are, the more ungrounded they tend to be. Many spiritual people claim to love “nature” while despising their own human nature. They are obsessed with divinity and ashamed of being made of flesh. This internalized self-hate and condemnation causes them to deny themselves their basic human needs as they try to transcend them.

Many of them have eating disorders under the guise of being “natural.” Since their dietary needs aren’t being met, and they’re perpetually experiencing a low grade starvation, their Kundalini or life-force is tightly coiled around the base of their spine at the Root chakra. It cannot rise. They’re living in survival mode.

Nothing is more grounding than food, and a well-fed body can relax. People not eating well aren’t sleeping well. They cannot meditate. Their bodies are wanting them to go hunt or gather or prepare food. They cannot enter higher states of consciousness, or ground those higher frequencies, so they feel like they’re losing their minds if they try. Their brains are starving as well. The human mind requires adequate protein, nutrient rich calories, and healthy fats to function properly. Rest and relaxation are a basic need, and someone who lives in hunger cannot know calm.

Other spiritual people refuse to be successful in a way that would be financially rewarding, or to enjoy any creature comforts. They never fulfill their life purpose they were born for because they feel unworthy of it, or fear worldly success would transform them into a bad person. They will even say things in sessions with me like, “I don’t want wealth. I would just donate it all to charity.” They’ll never have money to donate to philanthropic causes, because they’ve made up their minds to struggle.

The truth is, they are insecure and fear failure, so they never pursue their dreams at all. They tell themselves they don’t want it, and that their struggle to get by is noble. They sometimes invest what little energy they have left after busting their asses at their thankless jobs into supporting other people’s dreams. This can manifest as them trying to save, fix, rescue, or heal others as lost as they are, calling themselves “lightworkers”—or celebrity worship, living vicariously through those who are actually living.

Some are so attached to a narrative of hardship because it’s the only way they know how to receive attention and emotional support. Misery loves company, and they fear that if they start to do well, they’ll no longer be relatable and they’ll lose people. (Spoiler: they will. You have to be okay with leaving certain people behind in your personal advancement, but many cannot bring themselves to do it.)

Then there are those too busy saving society or their twin flame to practice self-care and be somebody. They don’t have time to do inner work when they’ve got so many conspiracy theories to share so they can wake people up. It’s a deep-rooted insecurity that manifests as covert narcissism, and they’ll often blame others, saying that they’re empaths and it’s everyone else who is toxic or low vibrational. Whenever I see this kind of mindset in my clients, I know I can’t help them. I can’t want better for them than they want for themselves, just like they can’t want that for the people they’re choosing to focus on to avoid self-reflection.

Ungrounded people are responsible for the economic imbalance and abuse of power by those who have all the resources. They’ve disturbed the natural order. Mankind was meant to thrive, and to have dominion over the animal kingdom, but not to have dominion over one another.

There would be equality for all if all became personally empowered and fulfilled their needs—but first, one has to stop denying themselves those needs and feel entitled to LIFE.

Women have a harder time with all of this. Their internalized misogyny causes them to follow strict diets, to make themselves small and pretty and soft-spoken and agreeable, and to believe it’s their job to mother and nurture everyone but themselves. I have news for you—the wage gap wouldn’t be a thing if women stopped putting their loved ones first and themselves last. Women who don’t have family or friends or lovers to selflessly devote themselves to often end up fighting some cause. I’ve seen too many social justice warriors who can’t pay their rent.

Your reputation as a good and righteous person will never grant you permission from others to live the life you want. You must give yourself permission. You have nothing to prove and need no one’s approval. Take note of all the other animals on Earth. They follow their instincts and play their roles. Deep down you know what you’re here to do, so do it.


3D
This dimension is the Sacral chakra (emotional feelings), Solar Plexus chakra (physical feelings/touch), Heart chakra (attraction), Throat chakra (taste/smell/sound) and Third Eye chakra (sight). The third dimension is the dimension of conscious awareness, and how we navigate the material man-made world while cocreating it, and/or coexisting within it. It is the five physical senses as well as emotions we’re choosing to feel. Remember, repressed emotions are unconscious, and part of the first dimension.

This is why people resist shadow work and healing. It is painful. It triggers all the emotions they’re actively avoiding in order to be functional, hardworking, productive adults. We’re trained to do this. Nervous breakdowns are not allowed.

Unfortunately, the spiritual community has a huge hand in this type of repression as well, because they want to “ascend” the 3D and promote escapism through spiritual bypassing. People are encouraged to “think positive” and have “good vibes only.” They’re even encouraged to “be in the now” instead of healing their past, and to “control their thoughts”—which is a batshit insane thing to believe one is capable of.

Please don’t try to control your thoughts, gaslight yourself, or “silence your mind” if you don’t want to lose your grip on reality. What you resist persists, and trying to silence your mind just makes it louder. Your job is to tune in and listen to that internal monologue.

The goal shouldn’t ever be to control. Control is an illusion, and control freaks are egocentric delusional people. Life happens, okay? And when it does, you have to process your very human emotions and thoughts. Otherwise, you become a dissociative sociopath without a conscience.

The goal should be self-awareness. Self-awareness is enlightenment.

We can become self-aware through observation. Physical pain indicates something is wrong with your body. Emotional pain indicates something is wrong with your life. Your emotions are your internal guidance system and personal truth. If it doesn’t feel right, it’s not. If a person or situation or life choice is causing you pain, it’s out of alignment with your destiny.

It sounds so simple because it is. Over time, the repression of painful emotions leads to physical pain and health problems. Even doctors will tell you this, and in the famous words of Dr. Henry Maudsley, “The sorrow which has no vent in tears may make other organs weep.”

We can also become self-aware through who we’re attracted to. Relationships are our mirrors. We can see ourselves with greater clarity when looking at our chosen partners. It’s up to each of us to fix ourselves instead of making another human being a personal project.

Remember the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope? There was nothing wrong with it! The Manic Pixie Dream Girl was a character in films who existed solely to inspire the protagonist, and teach them some invaluable life lessons that would further their personal expansion. I don’t want to burst any bubbles, but that’s what dating is for, regardless of gender and sexual orientation. If you find a life partner who wants all the same things you do, and neither of you is compromising yourselves in any way, that’s beautiful. But until that happens, your relationships are meant to help you find yourself.

Lastly, self-awareness is gained through observation of your physical environment, because you put yourself in it. The external world is a reflection of your internal state. Take a look around. You will always have exactly what you feel you deserve, so if you’re living a life you don’t value, you need to work on your self-worth.

Some people think they can evade the 3D by living off the grid, but this only works if you’re able to do that while also contributing to society somehow… which isn’t living off the grid, is it? We all have a purpose. We are in this together, and want to leave the world a better place than we found it. Refusing to participate in the world (which is again something I see in spiritual people wanting to “leave the Matrix” or fundamentalist cults who think everything human is sinful), is an internal war. People who don’t utilize their unique gifts have no sense of fulfillment.

There is a way to “be in the world but not of the world.” It requires you to be grounded in the 3D while also expanding your consciousness beyond the hive mind and social conditioning. When freethinkers choose to lead by example rather than conforming or hiding, we evolve as humans. That’s how positive changes are made for future generations.

The Third Eye chakra is interesting in that it’s part of the 3D, but also leads to all other dimensions of consciousness. The Third Eye is the portal. It rules the physical eyes, and eyesight, as well as the mind’s eye. The mind’s eye is how we imagine, visualize, and remember, all of which we’re consciously aware of.

Chapter 364,"A path of rich red paver stones led up to the Denoir estate, flanked by thigh-high bushes that were currently blooming with bright blue flowers despite the chill from the mountains. The mansion itself was huge, easily three times the size of the Helstea estate where I had lived in Xyrus, and the grounds around it rivalled the yards of the royal palace from my previous life. 
 
After taking a moment to make sure that Regis was still well within range of me, I strode forward. 

Floating light artifacts began to blink to life throughout the gardens as we approached, bathing the grounds in a soft yellow glow. One of the oversized double doors into the estate opened, and a woman in an ash-gray uniform came rushing out, moving quickly to meet us. Her bright orange hair was pulled up in a bun, just as it had been when I'd seen her outside the Relictombs descension portal. 
""Lady Caera!"" she said warmly, stopping in front of us and bowing. ""And Ascender Grey."" She bowed again. ""Welcome to the Denoir estate."" 
""Thank you,"" I said, returning her warm smile. ""And you would be Nessa, correct?"" 
The woman was clearly surprised, but made an effort to hide it, bowing a third time. ""You honor me."" Although her tone was steady, I could just see a red blush spreading onto her cheeks. 
""No need to be so humble,"" I said, gesturing for her to straighten. ""Caera expressed that you are half the reason she stayed sane under the highlord and lady's roof."" 
Nessa's blush deepened, and she seemed unsure how to reply. Caera saved her by reaching for the woman's arm and continuing toward the house. 
After a few steps, Caera shot a glance back over her shoulder, her expression both playful and scolding. 
She had prepared me for the evening, telling me everyone's names and explaining the evening's protocol, even outlining the likely topics of conversation should her adoptive parents attempt to wrangle me into some political debate. 

Caera most likely viewed me as some sort of unsociable brute who preferred picking fights with mana beasts to being sociable—and I guess she wouldn't be entirely wrong—but she didn't know that I had been a king in my previous life, which had given me years of practice dealing with people like the Denoirs. 
A few more servants were waiting in the entrance hall. Although most kept their eyes down in a respectful bow, a younger woman glanced a peek only to meet my eyes. I flashed her a polite smile, which she responded with a panicked look before averting her eyes back to the floor. From there, we were led to a posh sitting room. Lavish furniture was arrayed in small groupings throughout the large room, which burst with color, and an entire bar ran along the far wall. 
Standing at the bar was Lauden Denoir, who I'd met at the culmination of my trial. A woman in a sprawling maroon dress with brilliantly white hair that draped over her shoulders was leaning back in a lounging chair—Caera's adoptive mother, Lenora Denoir. The blond swordsman, Arian, stood in one corner. 
Lenora stood gracefully as we entered, practically floating up out of her seat and giving us a well-practiced but welcoming smile. Her eyes took in everything from my boots up to my wheat-blond hair in a single glance, and I could practically see the gears turning behind her perceptive eyes. 
Nessa bowed and stepped aside. ""Lady Lenora of Highblood Denoir. Lady Caera has returned. She brings with her a guest, Ascender Grey."" Then she straightened and backed up so she was nearly pressed against the wall next to the sitting room door, still as a statue. 
""Please,"" Lenora said, gesturing to the closest couch. ""Join me and my son for a drink while we wait for my husband. He should be down any moment."" 

Lauden carried two glasses from the bar, one of which he handed to his mother, then he turned and held out his hand to me. I took it firmly, meeting his eye. ""How nice to see you again, Ascender Grey. Or do you prefer professor, now?"" His manners were impeccable, but they couldn't completely shroud the obvious tension that he carried in his shoulders and brows. 
""Please, Grey would be more than adequate,"" I answered. 
Lauden handed the second glass to Caera. As soon as her adoptive brother's back was to her, she wrinkled her nose and set it down surreptitiously. Lauden didn't seem to notice as he returned to the bar. ""Well then, Grey, what would you like to drink? My father takes no little pride in the quality of our collection. Here you will find only the finest and most potent drinks, specifically tailored to be enjoyed by those with the elevated metabolism provided by strength in magic."" 
""It's only proper that I wait for the highlord, as tradition dictates he has the first drink when imbibing with guests,"" I answered properly before giving him a wink. ""But I would enjoy the opportunity to sample your fine collection, of course."" 

Lauden chuckled. ""A man of culture. My father will no doubt appreciate your adherence to the social norm, although I hope you'll forgive me for starting without you."" 
With this formality out of the way, Lauden continued to make small talk while Lenora questioned Caera about the academy. Lady Denoir and Caera's attitude toward each other was stiff and businesslike, and I caught Caera glancing in my direction more than once. 
After a few minutes, the noise of heavy, unhurried footsteps in the hall announced Highlord Corbett Denoir's arrival. 
We all stood as the highlord entered the sitting room, appearing from whatever preoccupation he had feigned in order to keep me waiting, a common tactic among these noble types. His clever eyes jumped to each of us in turn, though they lingered on me the longest. His white and navy suit looked like it cost as much as some people's houses, and he wore a golden-hilted saber at his side. 
Crossing one arm over my chest with my fist just below my shoulder, and the other behind my back, I bowed slightly, just the gentle inclination of my back. It was the type of bow one gave to show respect, but not subservience. This simple gesture—I had all but shouted that I saw our positions as equal—would set a spark to the questions in his mind, since the Denoirs already suspected I was secretly a highblood. 
""Welcome to our home,"" he said, unperturbed, before moving around behind where his wife was sitting and resting a hand on her shoulder. ""This meeting has been too long in coming, hasn't it my love?"" 
""Indeed it has,"" she replied, beaming up at him. To me, she said, ""You've given us such a novel experience, as neither of us are accustomed to having our invitations rejected."" 
Her execution was flawless—politefully teasing with barbs hidden between her words and a blade in her smile. 
""You have my apologies,"" I replied with a weary smile. ""It was my selfish desire to express to the other professors at Central Academy that I had rightfully earned a position there."" 
""Come now, we only jest,"" Lenora said with a chuckle. ""Regardless, Corbett and I are quite curious about you. Why don't we move to the dining room, and you can tell us about yourself over a wonderful dinner our cooks have prepared in your honor?"" 
Standing, I held out my arm to the Denoir matron, who took it with a curious smile. ""Lead the way, Lady Denoir,"" I said politely. 
She did so, with the rest of the Denoirs following after us. Corbett spoke quietly with Lauden about some business dealing while Lenora showed off the mansion, telling me about the many items on display throughout the estate, including several very fine paintings and tapestries, and at least a dozen different accolades returned from the Relictombs.

A long table dominated the dining room, with seating enough for at least thirty people. Three chandeliers hung from a high ceiling, filling the space with a brilliant light. Another small bar ran along one side of the room, while the other was covered up by cabinets and shelves filled with fine dishes and silverware in dozens of different stylings. It was clearly a valuable collection, and likely something Lenora took great pride in, a fact I filed away for our conversations. 
The table was already set, and Lenora led me to the far end, gesturing for me to take the seat just left of the head of the table, where Highlord Denoir sat a moment later. Lenora sat across from me, with Caera to my left, and Lauden across from her next to his mother. It was a position of honor, to be sat at the left hand of the highlord, which I assumed was normally reserved for his son. 
Lenora continued to chat away while hors d'oeuvres were served, and I grinned and laughed freely between bites of spiced figs topped with crisp bits of meat. The conversation shifted to Corbett over an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms, but he avoided any serious topics, expressing interest in my class at the academy and telling me about his interest in literature as he subtly bragged about the Denoirs' donations to the Central Academy library. Caera kept a cool kind of silence, not interjecting in the conversation unless she was addressed directly. 
It wasn't until the salad arrived that the conversation shifted into something more serious. 
""So, Grey,"" Corbett began, stabbing his fork into his bowl, ""I was hoping to learn more about your blood. It's no mean feat, securing a position at Central Academy. It speaks highly of your blood's connections."" 
I gave the man a wide smile and shrugged nonchalantly. ""I'm sorry to disappoint, but there is no mystery to uncover, whatever rumors might be flying around. My parents are from a remote village, and they were both simple people. My father was killed in the war,"" I said passively, my voice devoid of emotion. ""After the war was over, I turned to the Relictombs and became an ascender instead, trying to take care of my mother and sister."" 
Corbett listened as if he only half believed me, but Lenora's hand had moved to cover her mouth. ""Too many were lost fighting those savages in Dicathen."" 
Lauden grunted unhappily, turning away from the conversation and taking a long drink from his glass. 
Seeing an opportunity to take the reins of the conversation, I said, ""Indeed, far too many, especially in…what was it called? Dicathen's magic forests?"" 
""Elenoir,"" Lauden answered, staring down into his drink, his expression sour. 


""That's it,"" I said, rapping my knuckles on the wooden table. ""Poor souls. Although, from what Caera has told me, Highblood Denoir didn't have a presence there."" 
Corbett and Lenora exchanged a quick glance. ""No,"" Corbett answered after a moment. ""I recognized that we already had everything we needed in Alacrya. Maintaining a hold in such a far off land, and still full of turmoil, seemed an unnecessary complication."" 
""A fortuitous decision. Many others weren't so wise."" I turned to Lauden. ""You lost people in Elenoir?"" 
He tipped back his glass, finishing off his drink in one gulp. ""A lot of those who went to Elenoir to set up the holds were blood-heirs, or second sons. I knew many of them. Some entire bloods—those who dedicated the most to this effort—were wiped out, depriving Alacrya of many powerful voices and ending many potent bloodlines. And what did we accomplish—"" 
""Lauden,"" Corbett chastised, giving his son a subtle shake of his head. ""This isn't the time for such a conversation. Grey, I hope you'll retire with me to my study after dinner? A good fire and a Sovereigns Quarrel board make for a better backdrop to politics than the dining room, wouldn't you agree?"" 
Although disappointed—I wanted to delve more into this tension Lauden displayed, to see how deep it ran—I only nodded politely, and the conversation turned back to more mundane matters for the remainder of dinner. 
After we'd eaten as much roasted meat and fruit tarts as was polite—leaving the last bite on our plates to show that we'd been well fed and weren't gluttonous—the table was cleared and Lenora whisked Caera away. 
Lauden leaned back in his chair and gave me a curious look. ""Your star seems to be rising fast, Grey,"" he said with just a hint of a slur after several glasses of strong amber liquor. ""Best of luck at the Victoriad. It is the place to cement your position amongst the nobility—or to see yourself fall with all speed back to the ground."" 
""See to your mother and sister before retiring,"" Corbett said firmly, leveling a steady gaze at his son. He held out a hand to a side door out of the dining room. ""Grey?"" 
Wordlessly, I followed Corbett through the house and up into an office. I'd known people whose entire homes would have fit into the two-story study, and there were as many books as the Aramoor City library. The fire was already burning. 
""Have a seat,"" Corbett said, gesturing to a very fine leather chair resting to one side of a carved marble table, which had a game board etched into the surface and pieces already laid out. ""I assume you play?"" 
I nodded, then gave a helpless sort of shrug. ""I should say I have played. Caera enjoys reminding me that she has benefited from significantly more practice and training than I have."" 
Corbett's expression didn't change as he poured us both yet another drink and took the seat opposite me. I took a sip from the offered glass. It burned going down, but settled warm and heavy into my stomach. Some of my surprise must have slipped through onto my face because Corbett's lips twitched in a bare smile. 
""Dragon's Breath,"" he announced. ""I'm not surprised you've never had it. It's made with a rare spice that only grows along the banks of the Redwater near Aensgar. The warriors of Vechor will often drink it before a battle."" 
""And is that what this is?"" I asked, resting my glass on the edge of the board. ""A battle?"" 
The brief glint of a humorless smile returned. ""That depends on your skill."" 
He gave me the first move, and I started the game conservatively, moving a shield up the middle of the game board. ""Have the events in Elenoir soured the highbloods' taste for this war?"" I asked conversationally, although I watched Corbett's face carefully. 
He responded more aggressively than I'd expected, drawing a caster along the edge of the board. It was the same opening maneuver Caera often used. ""My son is headstrong, and has reason to be frustrated. Several of our friends and allies were lost in the asuras' attack."" 
""Although, to be fair, many more Dicathian lives must have been lost in the attack than those of Alacryans,"" I pointed out, continuing to inch forward with my shields. 
""All the more reason they should embrace the High Sovereign,"" he grunted, his eye on the game. Still, there was something in the lines around his eyes and in his stiff posture that told me he found the topic of Elenoir and all those deaths uncomfortable. 
""Perhaps,"" I replied, pretending to think about my next move as I took another drink of the fiery liquor. ""And yet, I can't help but wonder…if it meant avoiding further conflict between the asura, would it be worth giving up Dicathen?"" 
He frowned deeply, which highlighted his wrinkles and made him look about a decade older. ""You mean withdraw the forces there and abandon the continent?"" He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. ""That is a risky proposition. The blow to morale—"" 
""Let me phrase it another way,"" I said, dragging a striker across the board to take out his caster. ""If the cost of the war—the cost in highblood lives—had been made clear up front, would they still have supported it?"" 

We played a couple moves in thoughtful silence, although Corbett's eyes kept flicking away from the board to me. After a minute or two, he said, ""It is common for the lesser bloods to overestimate the power and authority of the highbloods."" 
I bit back an eager smile at his slip. ""Surely if a majority of the highbloods spoke together as one, the Sovereigns—"" 
""You have climbed far, and too quickly,"" Corbett said, taking his hands away from the board and leaning back in his chair. ""It is evident in the way you speak, like you have no experience with the higher levels of politics in Alacrya. You should be careful, Grey. The wrong word in the wrong ear can get you killed."" 
As if to emphasize his point, he took a striker through a gap in my shields and killed one of my casters. It left the striker piece open to a counterattack, but it weakened the inner circle of defense around my sentry. ""Rushing in, being bold…that is what those bloods who died in Elenoir did. And now many of them are less than the lowest unnamed."" 
When I responded by killing the striker, I noticed Corbett's knuckles were white as he picked the piece up, squeezing it between his fingers as if he could crush the carved stone to dust. 
""Why encourage such heavy investment in Elenoir if there was still such risk?"" I asked, my tone innocent and unassuming. 
Corbett set the piece down with a sharp clink and met my eye. ""Perhaps the Sovereigns didn't think the asura had it in them to break the treaty…"" But the truth was there, gleaming like a fire in his eyes. He didn't believe that the Vritra—deities themselves—could be caught so off guard. Which meant… 
""You think it was a trap,"" I said flatly, a statement of fact. ""Bait, to make the asuras break the treaty."" 
Corbett tensed. ""You are aware of the relationship between Caera and the Denoirs, correct?"" 
I nodded. 
""Did you know that, should we fail in our duty to the Vritra and to Caera, Highblood Denoir could be stripped of all titles and lands? Lenora and I could be executed."" 
Again, I nodded in response. 
""We are one of the most influential highbloods in the central dominion, even in all of Alacrya,"" he said, although there was no smugness in the statement. ""And yet, a misstep would mean our sudden and violent end. We do not serve kings or queens, as the Dicathians do. Our lords are gods themselves, and we are all subject entirely to their will, from the lowest unnamed to the wealthiest highblood. You would do well not to forget this fact, Grey. Do not think yourself untouchable because you have found some success."" 
Pondering this, I made a series of quick moves to end the game. Although I felt certain I could have ended it in a true win, taking my sentry across the board to Corbett's hold, my taste and patience for the game had faded. Besides, I doubted I would gain anything else from Corbett or his family that evening. 
When my caster finally killed his sentry, he gave a resigned sigh and held his glass up to me. ""Tell me, Grey, is it generally after you've beaten her that Caera reminds you of her tutoring in this game?"" 
I let a genuine smile show through the stoic calmness that I'd kept up for most of our conversation. ""How'd you guess?"" 
As soon as we returned to the ground level, Caera took me by the arm. ""Grey, I'm afraid we really should be going. Plenty to do still in preparation for the Victoriad."" 
""You're right, of course. Highlord Denoir and I—"" 
""Please, call me Corbett,"" he said, his tone shifting noticeably toward something approaching friendliness. He patted me on the shoulder and said, ""I enjoyed our game, although I'm afraid you distracted me with conversation—by design, I imagine,"" he said, giving me a sharp look. ""You owe me a rematch, which of course means you and Caera will have to return for dinner at a later date."" 
Caera was watching her adoptive father with unsuppressed surprise, and even Lenora seemed taken aback for a moment before sliding her arm around around the highlord. ""If anything, I'd say you owe it to us for keeping us waiting so long!"" Lenora and Corbett both shared a small laugh. 
I gave them another bow, slightly deeper than before. ""Thank you, both for the fine food and stimulating conversation."" 
Caera looked at me like a third eye had just grown in my forehead. ""Okay then, we'll see ourselves out, so…bye."" 
With that, the Denoirs bid us farewell, with Lady Lenora seeing us to the door herself while Nessa stood by. Caera gave a perfunctory farewell before leading us quickly away from the estate and out to the street where we could flag down a carriage to return us to the academy grounds. 
""What in the name of the Vritra did you do to Corbett?"" she said once we were well away from the doors. 
""What?"" I asked innocently, my mind already at work sorting through everything Corbett had told me. 
""I swear, you're like a handsome, mysterious onion,"" she said wryly. ""Every challenge that we face together reveals yet another layer to you. How exactly does a self-proclaimed nobody from the outskirts of Sehz-Clar learn to rub elbows with highbloods like you?"" Before I could answer, she kept going. ""No, never mind. Honestly, I don't want to know."" 
I laughed quietly as I threw the white cloak Kayden had given me around my shoulders. ""I've had reason to learn many skills. A dining room can be just as deadly as any battlefield."" 
""And your tongue is sharp as a sword,"" she scoffed as a carriage pulled by a bright orange lizard stopped for us. 
*** 
Black void. 
Just that, nothing more. 
What am I missing? I asked myself as I swam through the keystone realm. There is something here. I've felt it. 
The real problem was context. Djinn had handed down their knowledge in an esoteric way designed to spark insight, not to allow for memorization or the building of a skill. They likely had an instinctive understanding of their own teaching methods, much the same way that I had been able to read encyclopedias and tomes on magic when I was first born in this world. The Dicathian method for teaching and learning operated on the same principles as those of Earth. But the djinn's keystones did not. 
And yet I had gained insight into Aroa's Requiem from the first keystone— 
An idea struck me, sending my heart racing. I withdrew from the keystone and held up the black cube. If it was damaged somehow, perhaps… 
The golden rune flared to life on my back, glowing through my shirt, and amethyst motes of energy danced and jumped along my arm, flowing to the keystone until they swarmed over it like purple fireflies. 
But they didn't appear to be doing anything. 
There were no cracks to flow into, no damage to repair. More frustrating still, I didn't know if the godrune wasn't working because there was nothing to fix or because it couldn't repair the damage—like the exit portal in Three Steps' zone. 
Cursing my incomplete insight into the godrune, I released it, and the motes flickered and faded away. 
Several minutes later, I was still sitting there staring at the black cube when my office door opened suddenly, and Enola marched in and seated herself in the chair on the other side of my desk. 
""By all means, come in,"" I said, setting the heavy cube on my desk and looking at the precocious young woman. She was glaring down at her hands, which were clenched together in her lap. My voice softened slightly as I continued. ""You weren't in class after the bestowal. Did you receive such a powerful rune that they've allowed you to skip the rest of your schooling?"" 
She rubbed at her face then combed her fingers through her short golden hair. ""No. My blood matron recalled me to our estate for a couple days,"" she said stiffly. ""To discuss my future."" 
When did I become a teen counselor? I nearly said the words aloud, but bit my tongue. 
""I received a regalia,"" she said, her voice gravelly with restrained emotion. ""The only one in the academy to do so during this ceremony, even among the older students."" 
1
I let out a low whistle. ""That's serious."" 
With huff, Enola stood suddenly, nearly knocking over the chair, then winced and set it back in place. She stood behind it, her hands clenching the back. ""My blood has already arranged a posting for me in Dicathen after this season. I should have another two and a half years of academy, but they are moving me around like a piece on a Sovereigns Quarrel board, using my regalia to elevate our highblood."" 
""And putting you front and center if this conflict with the asura escalates further,"" I pointed out carefully. I considered saying more, offering her advice or a calming word, but I couldn't bring myself to comfort her; she was being sent across the sea to help keep my friends and family in check. 
Enola turned her chin up proudly. ""I'm not afraid to go or anything. I'm a warrior. But…"" She swallowed heavily. ""Is it really even a war, if we're battling asura? It seems more like an extermination to me. Regalia or not, how can regular soldiers make a difference in such a conflict?"" 
They can't, I wanted to say. Aldir had burned an entire nation like Elenoir had been built on the head of a matchstick. 
""My…"" She paused and slipped around the chair, taking her seat again. ""My brother was killed in Dicathen. In the early days, one of our first assaults. The same battle in which Jagrette, the Truacian retainer was killed."" She smiled bitterly, looking past me instead of meeting my eye. ""I remember because they announced it like dying alongside a retainer was some kind of honor."" 
I couldn't help but wince. I had fought and killed the poison witch Jagrette in a swamp near Slore, and a sudden realization hit me. While I was busy being angry about what these students' families had done, I hadn't even stopped to consider the fact that I could have killed their relatives in battle. 
""You must hate the Dicathians,"" I said, feeling somewhat guilty for my deception. 
""No,"" she said immediately, her answer firm. ""My brother died in honest battle. War is war. They were our opponent. Although I'll miss him, my brother was lucky to have such a war to fight in."" 
Enola fell silent, and I knew what she was thinking. 
""But fighting asuras…"" I probed. 
""I want to be a soldier, or maybe a powerful ascender."" She crossed her arms and sagged back into the chair. ""But I do not wish to be tossed away or burned up as kindling in a battle between greater beings."" Her eyes locked onto mine, then, like she was daring me to argue with her. 
Resting my elbows on the desk, I sighed. My gaze drifted to the keystone, and Enola's followed. ""Any one soldier can change the course of a battle,"" I stated. ""The strongest warrior can fall unexpectedly, while the weakest and most cowardly might stumble ass-backwards into victory."" I picked the keystone up and turned it over in my hand, recalling the djinn projection's words. ""But your path is your own, and only you can walk it. You might choose to give up your life, if necessary, but no one gets to throw your life away like it means nothing."" 
Enola tensed, her jaw visibly tightening as her eyes bore into me. ""Do you really believe that?"" 
I smiled and knocked the cube lightly against the desktop, breaking the tension. ""With every fiber of my being."" 
She gave me a single sharp nod, then looked again at the keystone. ""What is that?"" 
""Oh, this old thing?"" I said, flipping it in the air and catching it again. ""It's just a tool to help me meditate and channel my…mana."" 
As I stumbled over the word, very nearly saying aether instead, my mind connected two points of data I hadn't previously considered. Both times I saw the black-on-black movement within the keystone, it was when someone had approached me, interrupting my meditation. I had thought it was just bad luck, with the interruptions coming at exactly the wrong time, but what if… 
""Here, let me show you how it works,"" I said quickly, channeling aether into the keystone. 
My mind rushed into the darkness. It was alive with movement. All around me, subtle streams of inky black writhed and ran like oil over water. 
The keystone reacted to the presence of mana. Which explained why I couldn't sense anything within. 
Like a blind man trying to navigate a labyrinth, I thought, alive with sudden motivation in the face of such a challenge.

The Power of the Lord Souls,"I'm replaying DS1 and just remembered something that has always bothered me about the item descriptions for the Lord Souls. Each one, even the fragments, say that they can satiate the Lordvessel, but you are still required to get all four... 

Satiate is defined as filling to excess or fullness, so why do the individual Lord Souls not satiate the Lordvessel? Possibly a translation error? Perhaps, but I think it is more than that.

In DS2 it is said, ""Once the fire is linked, souls will flourish anew, and all of this will play out again."" We see this very obviously from the reincarnation of Gwynn, Izalith, Nito, Seath, and even Ornstein. Their souls stay intact, but find new bodies... almost like reincarnation. I want to talk more about this in another post, as it fascinates me, but as to why the Lord Souls were not enough...

My theory says that each of them would have been enough to link the flame. If Gwynn could do it with his soul, even after splitting it between tons of different people, the combined powers of Izalith, Nito, Seath, and the Kings was absolutely overkill. But I guess the powers that be (Gwendolyn and Frampt) wanted these souls to find new bodies. How likely would it have been for the Witch to be killed if she continued to grow in power? The demons would only have continued growing in both number and dominion had she been kept alive, and same with Nito. His servants would have continued to grow in number and wreck havoc across Lordran had he not been eliminated. My guess is that Frampt and Gwendolyn wanted for them to be assassinated by the chosen undead and their power used to fuel the flame. Even though it wasn't exactly necessary, it couldn't hurt to throw even more souls at it. At least, that's my theory. What do y'all think? I'm still curious, and am loving replaying DS1!",DarksoulsLore,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarksoulsLore/comments/spoxub/the_power_of_the_lord_souls/,,bubbatrain69,spoxub,/r/DarksoulsLore/comments/spoxub/the_power_of_the_lord_souls/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarksoulsLore/comments/spoxub/the_power_of_the_lord_souls/,0,2022-02-11

Technically, we could push the counter-attack now. The logistics bases and the war material stocks are above 50%. All units are at at least 80%, nearly 80% are completely refit and the personnel transfers and reinforcements are largely done. Nearly 75% of units have or are about to undergo force training.

Still, follow the logic chain here.

The Atrekna started with a single star system, they jumped forward to five others. From each of those five they jumped to five more. They repeated this, so from the initial star there is a fan five ranks deep.

Breket felt like he'd been turning inside out, folded, spindled, mutilated, and then yanked right side out. He could taste dirt, old blood, and that zingy feeling of metal on fillings. He lifted his head and shook it, looking around.

Half of his bridge crew was unconscious. Life signs above their heads showed they were all right, just suffering something called 'transit shock' and their breathing was getting better.

Grektik looked at his captain, then at his board.

""Everything's out. The only thing we have is internal coms, the internal computer network, and external cameras,"" he said.

""Can you see anything?"" Breket asked.

""Yeah. That big gray ship,"" Grektik said. ""We're snugged up under the primary hull, maybe a half kilometer from it.""

""Anything else?"" Breket asked.

""Yeah. Orange, yellow, and purple,"" Grektik said. He made a tossing motion at the main viewscreen and it winked on.

There were no stars visible from the camera angles. Just streaks of color that started nebulous and thickened until they were completely opaque.

TELKAN FORGE WORLDS

Before you ask, there isn't *any* stars you can pull luminosity and other data off of to get a cartographic check.

""So, we have no way of telling how far we've come? What about gravitics?"" Breket asked.

Grektik shook his head. ""Those big ships around us are messing it up too bad,"" he checked his scanners again. ""Yeah, the system is completely confused. It's recommending I do a low level reboot down in the server farm.""

Breket shook his head. ""Kretiker, anything?"" he asked the Assistant Chief Engineer, who had lifted his head up and rubbed at his eyes.

""A moment, Captain,"" the Engineer said. He frowned, tapped at his board, then leaned back. ""Everything's offline. Some kind of lockout.""

""I want to know how,"" Breket said.

""I can tell you,"" *Easy Jump*, the ship's DS, said, sliding out of her 'shock core' and into the holotank.

""Enlighten me,"" Breket said.

""When their combat VI jumped me, he grabbed access codes to everything, jumped back out, and apparently jumped back in,"" *Jump* said. She shook her head. ""He's got the DCC computers, the emergency bridge, and pretty much has control of the ship.""

Breket frowned. ""What's he doing?""

*Jump* shuddered. ""Chewing on bones. Well, that's what it looks like. He's decrypting secure files,"" she shuddered again. ""He's a combat VI, maybe a custom grown combat Dee-Ess. I don't want to go anywhere near him.""

The other holotank suddenly lit up and the marionette appeared again, hanging limp for a moment before straightening with a jerk.

""POSITIVE ASSERTION: TRANSIT SUCCESSFUL,"" the faceless, featureless mannequin stated in a loud voice. ""POSITIVE ASSERTION: SHIP INTACT. CREW INTACT. CARGO INTACT.""

It paused a moment. ""FORCEFUL WARNING: NEGATIVE ATTEMPTS TO REGAIN SYSTEM CONTROLS. ATTEMPTS DISCOURAGED. LETHAL BYPROCESS EXTREMELY LIKELY.""

Breket raised his eyetufts and looked at the rest of the bridge. ""You heard it.""

""POSITIVE INTERACTION REQUEST: TRADE."" the puppet said.

""If we trade you cats and dogs, will you at least take us back?"" Breket asked.

""POSITIVE QUERY RESPONSE: AFFIRMATIVE. RESPONSE EXPANSION: YOUR VESSEL UNABLE TO LEAVE WITHOUT ASSISTANCE&gt; POSITIVE REASSURANCE: WE WILL PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO ENABLE RETURN TO POINT OF INITIAL INTERACTION."" The mannequin was suddenly replaced by a timer, a little over two hours. ""STATEMENT DISPLAY: TIME UNTIL TRADE ENVOY ARRIVAL. MAKE READY.""

Breket looked around. ""You heard it. This might be weird, but if there's trade to be had, I intend on not only getting us out of this alive, but making a profit,"" he looked at the holotank and the timer and smiled. ""We have something they want. That puts us on the tighter gripping hand.""

Breket stood in his best trading vacsuit, watching as the bay doors of one of the secondary cargo holds opened. The permeable force field let the craft waiting beyond the doors through without evacuating the atmosphere, but Breket made sure everyone was in a basic vacsuit just in case.

The ship was not the basic shuttle that Breket had expected. He'd expected the standard Terran runabout. A short boxy body with a sloped front, two engines on pylons, and skids.

Instead, what came through was obviously armed and armored, turrets on the side and forward facing guns. Weapon pods on the underside of the short wings. All the weapons had covers on them.

""You can't even get an idea of the caliber or type,""  Helgret'tik said. Not only was she the sole female Telkan on the ship, she was also the ship's security and weapon's officer. ""Weapons are entirely wrapped. It's probably excused as being peaceful, but it keeps anyone from getting a good look at their weapons and sights.""

Breket just nodded.

The ship settled down smoothly, reminding Breket of a stinging insect settling down to make someone's day a lot worse.

The engines didn't cut off, just idled, and the side door slid open.

Terrans in heavy power armor jumped out, weapons held ready, and Breket gave a snapped command over his Captain's channel for everyone to stay calm. The armor was flat gray, a solid color, even the visors were the same color as the armor. Heavy shoulders, back collar, thickly armored legs and hands, thick torso.

Breket was pretty sure that everyone in the armor knew how to use it.

""Standard shipboard boarding sweep tactics,"" Helgret'tik mused.

One of the armors moved forward and Breket noted there was no rank insignia, nothing to make the armor look different than any other suit. The doors slowly closed and a half dozen of his crew moved forward with crates, setting them down.

""REQUEST QUERY: VISUAL CONFIRMATION OF FELINE AND CANINE SUBJECTS?"" was grated out. The voice was entirely electronic.

Breket knew that would be the first thing. He waved at his crew members, who lifted the crates and brought them forward.

""All immature. Capable of reproduction. Full medical checks, immunizations, and documentation,"" Breket said. ""Three cats, three dogs. I have multiple breeds, all young. No touching, their DNA is just as valuable as they are.""

The one that had spoke looked in each cage for a long moment before moving on to the next. After a moment they moved back in front of Breket.

""POSITIVE INTERACTION. REQUEST TRADE NEGOTIATION.""

Breket nodded. ""With the nanoforge and creation engine system, you know that trade value is less precious and rare or exotic materials and isotopes, but rather things with more esoteric value.""

""POSITIVE RESPONSE TO STATEMENT.""

""In light of that, I'm willing to sell you up to a third of my cargo of felines and canines,"" Breket said.

He tensed slightly. This was the sticking part. Too many times people had figured pulling a weapon was payment enough and Breket knew he wasn't in the position to argue at gunpoint with the armored figures in front of him.

""POSITIVE REACTION TO STATEMENT.""

""What do you have to offer to trade?"" Breket asked.

The armored figure held out a large datacube. One of the ones that usually acted as the main datastorage for a dreadnought's fire control system. On top was a standard datapad that lit up.

Schematics flickered by. Ships appeared and rolled and vanished.

""NEGATIVE STATEMENT: WEAPONS.""

""So, now weaponry schematics?"" Breket asked.

""NEGATIVE STATEMENT: MILITARY SURPLUS/EQUIPMENT.""

""So, everything is for civilian use?""

""POSITIVE REPLY.""

""I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking at,"" Breket said.

""POLITE SUGGESTIVE STATEMENT: PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED ENGINEER AND OR DAMAGE CONTROL OFFICER.""

Breket waved at Vutplent, the *What, Me Worry?*'s DCC officer. He leaned forward, looking at the schematics for a long moment. He turned to Breket.

""I'm not sure of the value, to be honest,"" he said.

Breket had a nose for a deal, just like he had good instincts of when to take a deal and when to run.

""One third of our feline and canine cargo,"" Breket said. ""It goes without saying that I expect them to be well treated and have comfortable lives.""

""POSITIVE AFFIRMATION TO FORCEFUL STATEMENT.""

""All right, we'll swap them for your data,"" Breket said.

Breket lifted his head up and looked around.

Everyone on the bridge was recovering quickly.

The external cameras were still fed to the viewscreen and he watched as the stars shifted, letting him know that despite the lack of vibration, his ship was moving.

One by one his crew stirred, most drinking a few squirts of water or fizzybrew.

He felt the sudden freefall feeling of that massive ship letting go of his trading vessel.

The holotank came back on, showing the puppet.

""FORCEFUL COMMAND: JOURNEY WILL BE PLEASANT AND SAFE.""

The puppet suddenly vanished and the holotank went dead.

Not before Breket saw a flicker move through.

""Oh, thank Enraged Phillip,"" *Jump* said.

""He left, didn't he? I thought I saw him,"" Breket said.

""Yeah, he's gone,"" she wrinkled her nose. ""Aux-Con smells kinda weird. Huh.""

""Check it,"" he turned to his crew. ""Go over *everything.* Compare the software to the OEM copies. Check all the logs. Turn off, recycle, and flush all systems,"" he looked at *Jump*. ""Let's make sure they didn't leave any nasty surprises for us or someone else.""

*Jump* nodded.

""Once that's done, plot a course for Telkan,"" Breket said. He leaned back in his chair. ""Confederate Intelligence is going to want to hear all about this.""

Anniversary Show III: Book Jay White in AEW | Breathe With The Switchblade,"**Prologue**

Following his loss of the NEVER Openweight Title in late 2021 to Tomohiro Ishii and missing out on a spot on the Wrestle Kingdom card, Jay White hadn’t been the same Grand Slam Switchblade since the pandemic began, almost exclusively appearing on NJPW Strong. Yet with a new year came a new Jay, and White made his thunderous return at The New Beginning in Osaka, standing side by side with his fellow Bullet Club stablemates and beating down CHAOS. However in his absence, the House of Terror, a Bullet Club subgroup, had formed and was making a dominant first impression in NJPW at Wrestle Kingdom 16, including EVIL’s NEVER Openweight Title win and a successful NEVER 6-Man Tag defense, whilst the rest of Bullet Club faltered, KENTA dropping his US belt to Hiroshi Tanahashi and Ishimori &amp; ELP failing to win the Junior Tag straps. And this division became clear upon White’s return, EVIL’s House of Terror refusing to stand with White’s Bullet Club. Tension between the two groups became evident, and the House of Terror started to show up less and less at ringside to support the likes of KENTA, The Guerrillas of Destiny, and even White himself. Jay made a successful in-ring return, defeating Tomohiro Ishii at Castle Attack, but was eliminated in the Semi-Finals of the New Japan Cup by none other than his fellow Bullet Club member EVIL. White eventually called out EVIL and the House of Terror on the Road To Sakura Genesis, EVIL defending his NEVER Openweight Title against Jay, along with a 6-Man Tag Title bout between the two sides, the battle lines officially drawn. And before New Japan Cup Winner Katsuyori Shibata took on Kazuchika Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight Title in the Main Event, EVIL went to war with the Switchblade, the present and ostensible future leaders of Bullet Club going head-to-head. However, it wasn’t EVIL who would be succeeding Jay, as after the ref was taken out and both White and EVIL were down, KENTA slid into the ring and nailed Jay with a GTS, before resting EVIL’s arm over him, the referee counting the 3 to end the match. KENTA sat cross-legged over White’s unconscious carcass, ushering in a new era of terror for Bullet Club. And in Jay’s final NJPW appearance before his departure, he was bested by KENTA at Dominion in June, the new leader of Bullet Club putting the previous one to sleep.

*All Out 2022*

*Kenny Omega vs Adam Cole* 

After months of tension between the two and the eventual betrayal from Omega, one year on from his debut, Adam Cole took on Kenny Omega at All Out, The Young Bucks and Paragon absent from ringside after a hellacious match themselves, retaining the AEW Tag Team Titles. Cole and Omega had been building to this match since Cole’s ostracizing from Bullet Club in 2017, and whilst Adam did fight his BC replacement in his departing match, he never got the chance to face Omega, a first-time-ever match happening live for the Chicago crowd. With no outside interference from their respective stables, the two were able to have an intense and personal matchup, 5 years of hatred for Omega built up inside Cole, ready to be released in a flurry of vicious offense. Yet as the bout reached the 30-Minute Time Limit, the desperation kicked in for both men, a great NJPW-esque sequence of high-action moves and finishers following, and after countering a One Winged Angel into a Canadian Destroyer, Cole was able to land a second Boom for the win, putting away his nemesis with only seconds to spare. 

*Adam Cole defeated Kenny Omega (29:48)* 

Cole was ecstatic, but his celebration was limited to what he could physically express, the adrenaline wearing off and the fatigue of the match catching up. Adam was helped to his feet by the ref and had his arm raised, yet the crowd started to cheer for a completely different reason, a figure making his way through the crowd and down to the ring! And before the ref could react, Cole turned around straight into a Blade Runner, Adam’s skull being drilled into the blood-soaked canvas. The official immediately checked on Adam before rolling out of the ring and out of danger, the hooded figure watching as Cole writhed in pain. And as the audience suspected, the attacker revealed themselves, Switchblade Jay White standing in an All Elite Wrestling ring only months after appearing in AEW. Smiling his sadistic smile again he had lost earlier in the year, Jay made his way over to Omega off to the right still recovering, and in a mirror image of White betraying Okada, he extended his hand to Kenny on the mat. But instead of lifting him into a Blade Runner, Jay simply helped Omega to his feet, former Bullet Club leaders coming face to face. The last time White and Omega shared a ring, Jay put away Kenny to win the IWGP United States Title, only weeks after denying Omega’s offer to join Bullet Club. There was most definitely bad blood between the two, but following Jay’s confrontation of Omega at Slammiversary in 2021 and their attempt to make amends, it seemed as if the pair were now on good terms, confirming it with a ‘Too Sweet’ in the ring. Jay White had joined All Elite Wrestling, and he was here to make sure everyone Breathes with The Switchblade.

*Full Gear 2022*

*Jay White vs Darby Allin*

*AEW World Championship Eliminator Tournament Final* 

Following his emphatic debut at All Out, siding with Kenny Omega and attacking Adam Cole, an attack that would later lead to Cole having to take time off, Jay White made his Dynamite debut, revealing that he regrets not joining forces with Omega earlier and betraying him in 2018, stating that he’d much rather have co-led Bullet Club together up until Kenny had decided to leave the company. Because Omega shares the same ideologies as White he’s come to find, and when two like-minded, and more importantly, incredibly talented and successful people team up, there’s little to nothing anyone can do to stop them. He made amends with The Bucks, who weren’t co0mpletely on board with this new alliance but shook Jay’s hand anyway, and White revealed himself as the first entrant in the AEW World Championship Eliminator Tournament, calling out the current champion Bryan Danielson in the process. Over the coming weeks, we’d see White make his in-ring debut against CM Punk in a massively hyped up first-round bout that lived up to the standards, Jay advancing in the tournament after pinning Punk, before besting PAC in the Semi-Finals to secure his spot in the Finals at Full Gear. And at the event, White faced off with fellow finalist Darby Allin, the two telling a great underdog story for Darby, whilst allowing White to put on a show in his PPV debut. Yet after catching a Coffin Drop into a Sleeper Suplex, a Blade Runner signaled the end for Allin, Jay White earning himself a World Title date with Bryan Danielson at Winter Is Coming.

*Winter Is Coming 2022*

*Bryan Danielson (c) vs Jay White* 

*AEW World Championship* 

Jay White continued his undefeated streak after Full Gear, calling out the babyface World Champion, Bryan Danielson, after each victory on Dynamite and Rampage and warning him for their match at Winter Is Coming. White put away the likes of Eddie Kingston, Jungle Boy, and most notably, Jon Moxley, going 2 – 0 against Mox after their G1 Climax clash in 2019. Bryan Danielson seemed unfazed and fairly confident, but Jay reminded him that he was in the same spot Bryan was only a year ago, and it was Danielson who failed to capture the World Title. Yet White promised to not make the same mistakes as Bryan, Danielson aiming to enter 2023 as World Champion. And after a brutal encounter between the two, it seemed as if Jay might prevent those plans, dodging a kick from Bryan that took out the ref before beautifully countering a Running Knee into a Blade Runner, however as he dragged himself into the cover, he was dragged out of the ring by none other than the returning Adam Cole! The Undisputed One nailed Jay with a swift Superkick before sending hi back into the ring, Bryan laying a single arm over White to get the delayed pin from the exhausted ref.

*Bryan Danielson (c) defeated Jay White to retain the AEW World Championship (24:35)*

Adam Cole entered the ring after Danielson had vacated it, standing over White and taunting him before lifting him up to a kneeling position by his hair, and he cracked White with the Boom, getting chased off by Kenny Omega afterward. Omega helped Jay to the back, but the challenge for Revolution was clear, and White would want nothing more than to accept. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Revolution 2023*

*Jay White vs Adam Cole* 

Adam Cole had gotten vengeance over White, costing him the most important match of his AEW career similar to how White had done so just a few months prior. White/Cole went on first on the stacked Revolution card, proceeding Paragon’s Roderick Strong competing in the Face of the Revolution Ladder Match, The Young Bucks interfering and sending him through a ladder that would sideline with him following the PPV, and later in the night, O’Reilly &amp; Fish continued their Tag Title reign with a successful defense against The House of Black. Jay and Adam set the standard for the show, having a great fast-paced bout, both men wasting no time in the opening stages and grasping onto their adrenaline as a lifeline fighting through the pain. Cole was back at 100% and proved it to the electric crowd, but ultimately, as he rebounded for a Last Shot, he ran straight into a swift Blade Runner from Jay, the Switchblade ending the bout from out of nowhere. 

*Jay White defeated Adam Cole (18:58)*

&amp;#x200B;

*Blood and Guts 2023*

*Jay White, Kenny Omega, and The Young Bucks vs Paragon and ???*

*Blood and Guts Match*

At Revolution, Jay White was able to rebound from his Winter Is Coming loss, putting away the man who cost him the World Title. But the two sides weren’t done after Revolution, as Paragon ambushed The Bucks, Omega, and White in their locker room backstage, seeking revenge on what Matt and Nick did to Roderick Strong at Revolution. A bout between Tag Team Champions Kyle O’Reilly &amp; Bobby Fish and Jay White and Kenny Omega was made for the following Dynamite, White challenging them to put the belts on the line, and they did so, having a spectacular television Tag Title clash. Omega revived his tag team move set from his time with Adam Page, whilst Jay had been competing in tag bouts with Bullet Club for years, the two working great together, but ultimately they were bested by the overpowering tandem of Kyle and Bobby, the champions landing a Total Elimination on Kenny for the win. However they were attacked after the match by The Young Bucks soon joined by White and Omega, yet with the help of Cole running down, they started to fight back, a massive brawl breaking out in the ring. As security attempted to separate the two teams, a strong British voice came from the stage, having not been heard since hen he was released in late 2019. Shouting that this chaos of faction warfare must cease, William Regal made his AEW debut, declaring that in two weeks time these two teams will go to war at BLOOD AND GUTS! The team of Jay White, Kenny Omega, and The Young Bucks would take on Paragon and a mystery entrant, William Regal set to oversee the fight on commentary. 

And at the show, the two factions did exactly that: go to war. Kenny Omega and Adam Cole started off, the two All Out opponents that began this whole rivalry fittingly beginning here, yet they were soon joined by Jay White, White and Cole immediately going after one another, Jay specifically asking Omega to step into the other ring as to let them battle it out themselves. As more and more entrants filled up in the ring, Paragon’s mystery partner came closer and closer, and as the buzzer sounded and Flight of the Valkyries played, Jay White and Kenny Omega turned towards the stage in fear. Out walked Bryan Danielson, receiving a huge pop from the crowd as he ran down to the cage. After losing his World Championship to Johnny Gargano in the Main Event, Danielson hadn’t been on AEW programming since, making his thunderous return here. And with the help of Danielson, what followed was another 20 minutes of hellacious action, neither of the two teams accepting defeat. However, it was Adam Cole who connected with the Boom on Jay White following a Danielson Running Knee for the win, Paragon and Danielson standing tall over their adversaries crimson-faced. 

*Paragon and Bryan Danielson defeated Jay White, Kenny Omega, and The Young Bucks (39:10)*

&amp;#x200B;

*Double or Nothing 2023*

*Jay White vs Bryan Danielson* 

*Lights Out Match* 

Up until Blood &amp; Guts, Bryan Danielson was the only man to have beaten Jay White, courtesy of Adam Cole, and once again, with the help of Danielson, White suffered his second pinfall loss, this time falling victim to the Boom from Adam Cole. Jay clearly wasn’t done with Bryan, calling him out in an erratic promo on the Dynamite after Blood &amp; Guts, calling out Danielson and blaming his involvement in a match he shouldn’t have been a part of as the reason why they lost. Bryan accepted the challenge for the match, setting the bout for Double or Nothing 2023. And after Danielson and Cole faced The Young Bucks on Rampage, White attacking Bryan afterward and hitting him with a Blade Runner onto a chair following their win, it was revealed that they would compete in AEW’s most prestigious stipulation: the Lights Out Match. 

And it was perfect for the pair, a limitless and unrestricted match allowing for both men to go all out and hold nothing back. White’s full sadistic potential was reached with every and all weapons at his disposal, and Bryan tapped into the dark and vicious side of Danielson he embraced as a heel, brutally beating down Jay at every opportunity. The only interference came from Kenny Omega mid-way through, Omega and Danielson having a brawl that led to Kenny being accidentally sent through a pane of glass by Jay White after Danielson dodged the move, yet Omega still had a Street Fight with The Young Bucks later on in the night against Paragon, being helped to the back by officials with blood smeared across his back. When it came to the Street Fight, Kenny refused help and despite being in evident agony, promised Matt and Nick he’d be fine, but Paragon saw through his reassurance, targeting his back and taking him out for the rest of the match with a huge Chasing The Dragon through a table. White got a near fall on Bryan though, reversing through Bryan’s roll-up and hitting him with a Blade Runner, but in a shocking kick out, Danielson got the shoulder up, becoming the first man to survive the Blade Runner in AEW! 

But later on in the match, after risking it all with a Flying Headbutt, Danielson willing to put it all on the line, White countered it with a Barbed Wire punch, a sickening image as crimson leaked out of Danielson’s skull, potentially concussed. Jay wasn’t done, a sadistic grin plastered on his face as he dragged Bryan over to where the thumbtacks lay in the corner, before lifting his carcass up and planting his neck down on them with a Kiwi Krusher. White hooked the leg but the crowd and ref knew it was already over, and Jay stood tall over Danielson, still smiling.

*Jay White defeated Bryan Danielson (33:15)*

&amp;#x200B;

*Fyter Fest 2023*

*Jay White and Kenny Omega vs The Young Bucks* 

Ever since his arrival in AEW and siding with Kenny Omega, The Bucks had always been cautious of Jay White, knowing his history of betrayal and disloyalty, yet in various segments, Omega had assured them that Jay had promised him his allegiance, Matt and Nick still unsure as to trust White. They had told Kenny that they thought he was becoming more aligned with Jay and less Jay being aligned with The Elite, White rarely at ringside for their matches whilst Omega was always at his, and in recent weeks, Omega showed up less and less to The Bucks matches. The Bucks should come first for Kenny, not White, but it seemed as if maybe Kenny only cared about the Switchblade. After Jay White bested Sammy Guevara on Rampage, Omega at ringside to support Jay, The Bucks ran down and confronted Omega, stating that they would’ve beaten Paragon easily if Kenny was at 100%, but instead, he prioritized Jay’s match versus Bryan, getting himself sent through a pane of glass by none other than White himself. Matt and Nick told Kenny that he needs to understand what loyalty means, because they don’t want to end up like Hangman, knowing full well Omega would leave them on the side if he could. Yet before they could continue, Matt was taken from behind and wiped out with a Sleeper Suplex, Jay sliding back into the ring and betraying The Bucks! Nick attempted to brawl with him but got hit with a Uranage, White wiping him out as Matt recovered in the corner. Jay had heard enough of The Bucks, and he kicked Nick out of the ring before kicking in Matt’s chest and dragging him over to a stunned Omega. Kenny was evidently conflicted, not knowing who to side with, but as White moved to the apron and held Matt in place on the ropes, shouting at Omega to hit him, Kenny had to make a choice, and he hit Matt with the V-Trigger, White laughing and smiling as Matt slumped into Kenny, Omega pushing away his former ally. Jay and Kenny stood tall, Omega with a new sense of allegiance. 

The inevitable but highly anticipated matchup between the former allies was set for Fyter Fest, and after watching his former friend stab his own twin brother in the chest with a V-Trigger, he knew that Kenny would’ve done the exact same thing if it was him up there instead of Matt. Nick started off the bout hot, running wild on Omega before Kenny frantically tagged out to Jay, Nick finally free and able to beat down Jay the way he’s wanted to since he first arrived in AEW. Both sides weren’t going to cease until the other fell, and the match broke down quickly, intense sequences and emotional encounters filling the gaps between the huge spots. However, to Nick Jackson’s disagreement, Matt offered Omega one last chance to turn back, extending his hand for Kenny to shake, and Omega took it, only to pull him in for a brutal knee to the face, sending Matt backward into Jay White who hit him with a Sleeper Suplex, a mirror image from when White betrayed them. Omega hit Nick with a One Winged Angel to get the win, putting an end to The Elite.

*Jay White and Kenny Omega defeated The Young Bucks (23:07)*

&amp;#x200B;

*Homecoming 2023*

*Jay White vs Adam Page*

The newly reformed team of Kenny Omega and Jay White made their return to Fyter Fest on Night 2 in glorious fashion, seen exiting a limo in three-piece suits, Omega returning to the pure cocky heel he thrives as. They stated that now that they’ve been freed of the chains of the weights that were holding them down, they’re ready to take over AEW for good. And in the Main Event, they made their presence known, attacking both Johnny Gargano and Adam Page in their AEW World Championship clash! Gargano was mid-way through celebrating his retention when White and Omega struck, beating down the champion and challenger to huge boos from the crowd. Yet as White set up Gargano for a Blade Runner, Bryan Danielson ran down for the save, chasing off Kenny and Jay! Having been out of action since Double or Nothing, Bryan made his thunderous return to AEW, standing tall with Gargano and Page as Omega and White escaped through the crowd. 

It was revealed that at Fight For The Fallen, we’d Jay White and Kenny Omega take on former Winter Is Coming opponents Bryan Danielson and Adam Page, a year and a half after their legendary 60-Minute Time Limit Draw for the World Title. Whilst we did get to see Jay White and Bryan Danielson interact, another pair of Winter Is Coming opponents and former Lights Out competitors, and Kenny Omega and Bryan Danielson interact, the two having not fought since their tie at Grand Slam in 2021, the main focus was on Kenny Omega and Adam Page, this being the first time they had stepped foot against one another since Full Gear 2021. For the majority of the match, they avoided one another, teasing the crowd with the eventual interaction and it came when Adam Page set up for a Buckshot Lariat on Jay, but as he flipped over, Omega stood in his way, blocking White from the Lariat! Page instinctively stopped before hitting Kenny, coming face to face with his greatest rival, but White shoved Omega into Page before attempting a Blade Runner, Bryan sliding into the ring and hitting Jay with a Running Knee! And after a few more minutes of reversals, counters, and finishers, Bryan Danielson nailed White with a Flying Headbutt, scoring the victory using the move that failed him last time.

And it was announced that at the upcoming Homecoming Dynamite special, we’d see a first-time-ever match-up in the form of Jay White vs Adam Page, as well as Kenny Omega vs Johnny Gargano vs Bryan Danielson for the AEW World Championship in the Main Event. White/Page started off the night hot, having a fast-paced and fun bout, the pair having given out equal offense and never having the speed of the bout cease. And in a great reversal, Page attempted to hit the Buckshot Lariat he never got to hit at Fight For The Fallen, but he ran immediately into a swift Blade Runner, Jay putting away Page in another blink-and-you’ll-miss-it finish.

*Jay White defeated Adam Page (16:48)*

&amp;#x200B;

*All Out 2023*

*Johnny Gargano (c) vs Jay White* 

*AEW World Championship*

And in Homecoming’s star-studded Main Event, Johnny Gargano successfully retained his World Title, tapping out Omega in the Garga-No Escape. And whilst Omega/Danielson II was made official for All Out, Jay White vs Johnny Gargano for the AEW World Championship was announced as the Main Event, a dream match occurring on the new grandest stage. Jay had been rising up the Rankings throughout the year with wins over Adam Cole, The Young Bucks, and now Adam Page all boosting his win record higher and higher. And following Homecoming, White was #1 on the leader board, earning his shot to become the true #1 of AEW. After failing to capture the gold at Winter Is Coming from Bryan Danielson, later beating Bryan at Double or Nothing, White wasn’t going to lose his second opportunity at becoming champion, going all the way up to 4 on the referee’s count and using whatever legal foreign weapons available such as a brutal Blade Runner into the ring post and a vicious Kiwi Krusher on the barricade. He even attacked Gargano before the bell during his entrance, wanting to get the upper hand at any cost, and this led to Johnny having to fight his way up from the bottom, telling an underdog story as the sadistic Switchblade continued to beat him down. Johnny would have bursts of energy but would be quickly shut down by White, yet after he countered a Kiwi Krusher into a Small Package, followed up by a Superkick and Hurts Donut, Jay only just managed to kick out, the match shifting as Gargano got the upper hand. 

Jay was no longer in control, and Johnny was free to run wild, putting on spot after spot to the crowd’s delight. White and Gargano were exhausted as they reached the 30-Minute mark, and desperation kicked in, pulling out all the stops to beat the other. However, after Gargano reversed a Blade Runner into a Garga-No Escape, it seemed as if White was forced to tap, but he repeatedly bashed Johnny’s skull into the canvas busting his nose open as blood poured from his face! Gargano let go of the hold and made his way to his feet for a Superkick, yet Jay caught the leg, pulling him in straight into a Kiwi Krusher! And as Jay set him up for a Blade Runner, he smiled one last smile, before planting Gargano down, spiking his head on the mat. The ref counted the 3, and Jay was handed his new title, cementing himself as King Switch. 

*Jay White defeated Johnny Gargano (c) to win the AEW World Championship (36:03)*

After beating Bryan Danielson earlier in the night, Kenny Omega ran down to celebrate with White, still limping from his match with Danielson, yet as he raised his arm, in a mirror image to the 5th of January 2018, Omega made Jay’s signature hand gesture across his throat before pulling in White for a Kamigoye! Jay slumped to the floor as Omega stood over him, and Kenny retrieved the World Title from his grasp, Omega proving where his loyalty lies: with the gold. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Full Gear 2023*

*Jay White (c) vs Kenny Omega* 

*AEW World Championship* 

A year on from Jay White’s debut at All Out 2022, attacking Adam Cole and siding with Kenny Omega, Omega betrayed that alliance by attacking Jay, wanting the AEW World Championship for himself. A match between the two seemed inevitable, and it was made official for Full Gear, their only other bout occurring similarly after Jay White turned down Omega in 2018. Grand Slam 2023 was announced to be happening once again in between All Out and Full Gear, and a bout between Omega and White was set for the show… in a Tag Team Match. Both men would bring along mystery partners ahead of their Full Gear clash, and as the show got closer, speculation about who they’d be started to grow. Would Omega enlist the help of Adam Cole? Could Jay White bring in a former Bullet Club member? Would Johnny Gargano side with Omega against Jay? None of those came to fruition however, as White revealed his partner to be none other than Bryan Danielson, the two former blood enemies teaming to take down their common nemesis. But in Kenny Omega’s corner, reforming a once-unstoppable team, was Hangman Adam Page, the crowd popping huge for the one-night-only pairing of the former Tag Team Champions! Both teams went all out in Grand Slam’s Main Event, an absolute stacked match worthy of the spot, and after 25 minutes of non-stop action, the famous Buckshot Lariat/V-Trigger combo put away Danielson, White leaving him for dead is Omega and Page stood tall. Yet Kenny wanted to make it clear this alliance was temporary, stabbing Page in the back once more with a literal V-Trigger to the spine. Omega was done with allegiances, and he kept his eyes on the prize over Jay’s shoulder as White retreated. But in Full Gear’s Main Event, following an insane bout complete with high-octane spots and near falls, White countered a final V-Trigger into a Blade Runner, walking away as champion and leaving Omega behind him, defeated.

*Jay White (c) defeated Kenny Omega to retain the AEW World Championship (27:20)*

Jay White stood atop All Elite Wrestling, having beat their ace, and now, with the World Title over his shoulder, he smiled his sadistic grin for the crowd, everyone now truly breathing with The Switchblade. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Epilogue**

It wouldn’t be long before Jay found his next challenger, as after beating out MJF in the World Title Eliminator Tournament Finals, Jungle Boy staked his claim to the belt for Winter Is Coming, White putting away Jungle Boy in another great installment in White’s extensive list of fantastic AEW matches. Yet he was attacked after the match by a hooded figure, and it was none other than IWGP World Heavyweight Champion KENTA, the man that caused White to join AEW and the man who took over as Bullet Club leader. A match between the two was made for Wrestle Kingdom Night 1, in a non-title Champion vs Champion bout, Jay making his return to NJPW after a year and a half. And at the event, White put away KENTA in a brutal bout, finally defeating the man who took all his power. In the coming months, Jay would take on previous rivals such as Adam Cole, Bryan Danielson, and even Adam Page, as well as some other challengers such as CM Punk, his first AEW opponent, and Jon Moxley, however, he would eventually drop it to Darby Allin, calling back to their Full Gear 2022 match, White returning to NJPW to conquer once more.",FantasyBookingElite,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyBookingElite/comments/sqe0n3/anniversary_show_iii_book_jay_white_in_aew/,Firestorm Booking,ImThatWrestlingGuy,sqe0n3,/r/FantasyBookingElite/comments/sqe0n3/anniversary_show_iii_book_jay_white_in_aew/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FantasyBookingElite/comments/sqe0n3/anniversary_show_iii_book_jay_white_in_aew/,0,2022-02-12
(SPS) Small Filters,"Small Filters are flash fiction stories that capture moments of cataclysmic change, inspired by Fermi's Paradox which, it should be noted, is neither Fermi's nor much of a paradox really. More like a regular old mystery. In any case, you can check some of them out or follow me for more on [Medium](https://medium.com/small-filters). In the meantime, here's the first one. I call it...

[**Fern Leaf's Paradox**](https://medium.com/small-filters/fern-leafs-paradox-2af0bb128c2)

“They call it a paradox”

“Who does?”

“The new guys. ‘Fern Leaf’s’ paradox or something. Apparently they thought it was the reason no one spoke to them” One-Of-Many from the Centaurus Super Cluster dropped a larva in its soup and slid back in its chair, betraying what looked like, and probably was, knowledgeable self satisfaction.

The table fell silent for a moment, before amused rustling from an incomprehensible orifice of the Germanium Entity sent the usually reserved Laniakea diplomats into a flurry of what could loosely be described as raucous laughter.

“Those fools!” squealed the Nitraxi Limefish.

“Oh come now. We’ve all been there…” Fluffles the Annihilator was perched peaceably on the rim of it’s feeding cannon “…and we all found our way here. Let us not judge too harshly. After all, shouldn’t we be the least bit curious?”

There were murmurs, scratches, screeches and beeps of reluctant agreement.

“The Napping Entitlement concur,” came a series of vibrations from their virtual ambassador. “My bewhiskered wards, entitled as they are to dominion over the infinite depths of emergent realities, have relayed in conspicuous uniformity a desire to understand how these creatures have managed to emerge from the funnel unscathed, with complete intraspecies contact and zero interdiction”

“Impossible!” There was an unfortunately audible frustration in the Nitraxi’s voice, as it rose to a tenor that would melt most composites, were it not for the bowl.

The sound of a crowd yelling incoherently came roaring out over the elongated mandible of Pop Fizz Kadunkadunk, Chief Diplomat of the Whiz Bang Confederacy. It was followed by the approximated sound of petty squabbles, which peaked before slowly mellowing into exasperated agreement.

“It’s true!” said Fluffles, adding an appropriately inflected “Mmmm” to echo the onomatopoeic sentiment. “My progenitors had ascertained as much before dutifully downscaling. Apparently they worked it out, with only a brief period of annihilation. Though I find your indignance understandable Nitraxi…” Fluffles wobbled precociously. “…given your condition”.

A piercing shriek filled the room, briefly disorienting the more gelatinous representatives, before being muted by the intoxicating influence of the Nevermind. Fluffles cast a dubious set of eyes at his vacant looking counterpart, who sat staring blissfully at an empty plate.

“It is our understanding…” One-Of-Many interjected, with characteristically pleasant condescension “…that they first crossed the meta-data event horizon with primitive media and rudimentary scribblings only a few thousand generations ago. Less than half a degree of galactic rotation. A few undecillion jiffies”

“Which is theirs?” The larva had attained some modicum of sentience within the safe confines of the soup and was now compelling it’s maternal relay to multitask. One-Of-Many reconstituted the upstart with a slurp and continued “Despite the usual proliferation of cataclysm and even a peculiar fondness for self annihilation…” An antenna nodded respectfully at Fluffles “…they appear to not only have survived the gauntlet of mass communication, but embraced it!”

“Inconceivable!” screeched the fish.

One-of-many winced diplomatically before continuing again. “One and many would have thought so, yes. Yet, they have undertaken a persistent and invariably reckless campaign of ‘getting to know each other’”

There was stunned silence. A ball of iridescent gas asked if it could borrow a chair. “Certainly! Anyway, as we were saying, they actually made it through. A wilfully dense, pardon my language, network of independent beings, forcing a higher threshold of information tolerance”

“Clearly they have little regard for any reality, much less themselves” came a series of delicate rumbles from the Entitlement’s corporeal representative.

“Perhaps. They have essentially bludgeoned themselves with a meta-verse. It’s astounding really”

“Indeed, if at all true…” Fluffles interjected with a now contrarian swagger.

“Well yes. However, if true, then it means these creatures have achieved a hive *of* minds. Something we abandoned in favour of unification. Something we have each avoided in some fashion. *If* true it could pose a tremendous threat to all. To the Germanium Entity and its uncompromising denial of probability mechanics…” The ineffable blob rattled and hissed, before excreting a small mineral cuboid “…to the multitude of masters ensconced in their own personal realities” The Entitlement’s ambassador let out a noticeable purr. “Even to the eviscerated senses of the Uncertain Empire and their cold eonic dance with chaos” The group craned and articulated themselves towards the lone cylindrical metallic figure at the end of the table, which blinked it’s single red diode once in confusion. “You see,” One-Of-Many continued. “There’s a good reason we keep these meetings, and contact in general, to a minimum”

“What about you?” demanded the Nitraxi gratingly, gesturing towards the Nevermind with an obnoxious polyp. “What do you say?” There was no response. No movement. No thing from the Nevermind. Typical.

“It’s no use. They never say anything. Always show up, but never contribute” Fluffles was visibly disappointed, but understood. “At least they stick to their…”

“We…” The table fell silent again. “We *ARE* curious”

It was about to begin.

“Good equinox and welcome to the twenty seven million six hundred and twelfth meeting of the Cosmic Filter Survivors Society. Please keep exchanges to a minimum. We’re content to be welcoming a new member today. All the way from a small blue-green planet in the outer spiral arm of what they call the ‘*Milky Way*’ galaxy. Sentient lifeforms, please mobilise your appendages for the Humans!” The room erupted in something resembling applause as an opaque meaty looking biped strode confidently onto the stage.

“Hi everyone, I’m Alex and I just want to say how wonderful it is to be here and how much I and *ALL* my fellow humans are looking forward to meeting each and every one of you!”

“Oh shit” Fluffles muttered. “We might have to do something about that”",scifi,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/sqwtmk/sps_small_filters/,,DjinnMorrison,sqwtmk,/r/scifi/comments/sqwtmk/sps_small_filters/,https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/sqwtmk/sps_small_filters/,0,2022-02-12

&gt; TORONTO, Feb 12 - Toronto-Dominion Bank has frozen two personal bank accounts into which C$1.4 million had been deposited to support protesters fighting the Canadian government&amp;#039;s pandemic measures, a bank spokesperson said on Saturday.

&gt; Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comTD applied to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on Friday to take the funds, which were sent through GoFundMe and bank transfers, so they can either be sent to the intended recipients or returned to the donors &amp;quot;Who have requested refunds but whose entitlement to a refund cannot be determined by TD,&amp;quot; the bank said in a statement.

&gt; One of the bank accounts received a lump sum of C$1 million through GoFundMe, while the rest was sent to the second account through multiple bank e-transfers, the TD spokesperson said.

&gt; GoFundMe took down the protest convoy&amp;#039;s donation page on Feb. 4 after it reached $10 million, prompting most of the protesters to turn to Boston-based GiveSendGo.

&gt; The Ontario Superior Court on Thursday ordered GiveSendGo to freeze all funds sent in aid of the protest.

&gt; Canada&amp;#039;s other major banks did not immediately respond to emails asking if they were taking steps similar to TD.The country&amp;#039;s anti-money-laundering agency told a parliamentary committee on Thursday that it has not seen a spike in suspicious transaction reporting from the banks in recent weeks.

"Behind the Mask, Chapter 19 [fm] [Incest] [Cousin/Cousin]","So. My boyfriend had almost killed himself. I’d given him a proper chewing out afterwards, and like before he apologized profusely. It seemed he was feeling better now about the whole situation with Jordan. He had freaked out when he thought that many emotions were stemming from Jordan and not himself, and I’d finally opened up to him and talked about my relationship with my cousin.

It was cathartic, much like when I’d told Coco. This time, though, I was telling it to the person that had a part of Jordan inside him. August realized how similar he and Jordan were, that anything he was feeling wasn’t necessarily foreign. He wanted to see how he would handle any intrusive thoughts or feelings now that he was armed with the knowledge of where they came from, but he made me promise to love him for him, not for Jordan.

I smiled. The two of them might have been the best of friends. How I felt about them now was different. It was so hard to describe. Maybe the One didn’t exist. It really was possible to love another as deeply, without pushing them to fit the hole the other had left. Leon had certainly overcome that hurdle. His words came back to me. *It’s accepting the person as they are.* I realized I’d already passed the point of trying to mold August into Jordan. I loved him for him. God, this was so corny.

“Alex?” said the little girl on my lap. “Are you okay?

“Hm? Yeah, sorry. Where were we?”

“The big bad wolf was just visiting the first piggy.”

Outside, a car pulled up to the house, and I peeked through the curtains. Two people, a man and a woman, presumably returning from a date. They couldn’t go out in public, and they weren’t going to my club, so it made me wonder just where they’d whisked themselves off to. I grinned, shaking my head at my own curiosity.

“Ah, yes.” I patted the girl’s head and continued the story.” So the big bad wolf went to the first piggy, who had built his house out of straw. And he called out and said, ‘Little pig, little pig, let me come in!’ ‘Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!’ said the first piggy.” I could hear movement in the house now, footsteps approaching the room. “And so the wolf said, ‘Then I’ll huff, and I’ll puff–’”

The door opened, and Senator Barnes stared at me, his eyes near bugging out of his head. The woman with him, Krista, gasped and almost rushed forward, but I fixed her with a stare so cold that she froze. I pulled their daughter closer to me, adjusting the storybook in my hands.

“‘–and I’ll blow your house in!’” I finished, closing the book. “We’ll finish later, okay Lisa?”

“Okay!” she said cheerfully. “Hi mommy! Hi Uncle Bill!” She waved to the two adults, cute as a button. “Alex said she was your friend!”

“What are you doing in my house?” Barnes growled, holding Krista steady.

I let an innocent smile spread across my face. “I just came to play with little Lisa here. She was so alone, especially after her babysitter left.” Immediately, Krista took out her phone and began dialing, either to the cops or to the babysitter. “Ms. Barnes.” She looked at me with wide eyes, which darted to her daughter and then back to me. I leaned down, putting my face right next to Lisa’s. “Let’s not be hasty, alright? We wouldn’t want to do something we all regret.” Terror wreaked her face, and I sighed. “Don’t worry. I’m just here to have a little chat with your brother. He’s a very difficult man to get ahold of. Could we have a moment alone?”

Krista gulped and nodded, then held out her hands as she crouched. “Come on, Lisa. Mommy’s going to–”

“Can’t you see Lisa and I are having fun?” I raised a brow, and Krista began trembling.

“Please. She’s just a child.”

Ol’ Billy Barnes pulled his sister to her feet, whispering in her ear. “Just give us a moment, babe.” With great reluctance, Krista continued down the hall, and we heard her door shut.

“Wonderful,” I declared. “Wow, it’s been a hot minute since we saw each other, Bill! Can I call you Bill?”

“No,” he said stiffly, entering Lisa’s bedroom and closing the door behind him.

“You see, Bill, we had a deal. Do you remember that? Either you agreed to terms, or you walked away. If we’d left it at either of those choices, we’d still both be sitting pretty right now.” I pulled Lisa closer into my lap, and she seemed to enjoy the cuddles. She was bouncing her head gently off my boobs and giggling, which suited me just fine. Better that she wasn’t really listening to our conversation. “But instead I had to speak to our mutual friend. You know the one, right?”

Barnes swallowed and nodded. “And where is our mutual friend right now?”

“Well, the fact that I’m here should give you some idea, shouldn’t it?” I sneered, pushing the curtains aside to gaze nonchalantly out into the night. “But if you want specifics… Lisa, do you like nursery rhymes?”

“Yeah,” she replied.

“Alright, well you probably remember this one, right? Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.” I made eye contact with Barnes, who was visibly sweating. “All the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t put Humpty together again.” I gave him a humorless smile. “He’s probably a can of *chili con carne* by now.” Barnes stiffened, clenching his jaw. “Yeah. You bet on the wrong horse, buddy.”

“So what do you want?” he almost whimpered.

“I want what we agreed upon,” I said casually. “Except throw in the other half as a late fee. I’m a forgiving person, but after everything that’s happened, I don’t think you should be governor after all. We need to set a good example for your… niece, don’t we?”

After a moment’s hesitation, after glancing at Lisa on my lap, he finally said, “Fine. My people will be in touch. We’ll have payment sorted soon enough.”

“Oho, it’s not so simple, Bill. That’s what you said last time. If I don’t get my money in twelve hours…” I turned Lisa around to the side so she could look at me, and I turned my voice cheerful. “…then Uncle Bill gets to be on the news!”

“Yay! Uncle Bill, can I be on the news too?” she exclaimed.

“No! No.” Barnes held his hands out, breathing heavily. “You… You wouldn’t. You’d get exposed too. You said you wouldn’t risk your patrons.”

“Ah, but you see, Bill. I’ve changed the contents of my Pigeon,” I announced. He looked at me quizzically. I covered Lisa’s ears with my palms. “If I don’t get my money in twelve hours, the story that goes out to the press isn’t that you fucked your sister and had a bastard incest daughter. It’s that you’ve displayed sexual misconduct toward three of your aides.”

“…But I’ve never–”

“It doesn’t matter, Billy Boy. You know the times we live in now. The media will dig and dig and dig. And maybe some women *might* speak out and lie to get their five minutes of fame. Depends on how much of an ass you are, I suppose. But what the media *will* find is Lisa, and everything her mom and Uncle Bill have been up to.” I sat back, shrugging. “And my club and I will remain completely untouched, because even if you snitch, nobody is gonna believe a word you say. Just some fairy tales spun by the disgusting incest senator.”

He was thinking of any way to get out of this, and I watched the cogs spinning in his head. “There’s no way you come out of this unscathed,” he muttered. “If I ever go down, you’re going down with me.”

I just smiled and uncovered Lisa’s ears. “Lisa, do you know how to sing Itsy Bitsy Spider?”

“Yeah!” she chirped.

“Okay, let’s take turns! You go first.”

“Okay! *The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout,*” she sang.

“*Down came the rain and washed the spider out,*” I continued.

“*Out came the sun and dried up all the rain.*”

I looked at Barnes again, no longer smiling. “And the itsy bitsy spider just climbs up the spout again. Of course, if I just get my money and we go about our business, my Pigeon stays caged up and nobody is the wiser about your family.” I hefted Lisa off my lap to stand, then bent down and playfully squeezed one of her cheeks before patting her back to coax her out of the room. “But part of me does hope you don’t pay your dues. I’ve never had to use a Pigeon before. Kind of excited to see what kind of shit storm it could kick up. And besides, Lisa wants to be on TV,” I added with a smirk, louder so Lisa could hear and cheer in agreement. “I’ll see myself out.”

Barnes ushered Lisa to Krista’s room, standing between me and the door. Suddenly, he reached into his coat and pulled out a gun. It was a nice shiny six-shooter, and from the looks of the man, it had never been fired before. But credit where credit was due, he had it trained squarely on me, not wavering at all.

“You hold it right there, bitch,” he snarled. “You come into *my* house and threaten me with *my* daughter? Gotta hand it to you, you’ve got guts.”

“Oh wow. You carry a gun *on* you. Seems you’ve made quite a few enemies, eh?” I sighed, shaking my head. “Damn. Made the same mistake our mutual friend made, didn’t I? Walked right into the lion’s den.”

Barnes chuckled once. “I suppose if you don’t learn from others’ mistakes, you have to learn from your own.”

“And speaking of our mutual friend,” I continued, wagging a finger at his gun. “Y’know he did this exact same thing. But the thing is, I’d filled his belly with sleepy juice, filled his lungs with sleepy gas. His aim was all over the place. But not you. You have a nice, steady hand.”

A bullet flew through the window and pierced Barnes in the wrist, making him scream and drop the gun. Lisa almost came running, but from the sounds of things, Krista scooped her up and retreated back to her room. Barnes was on his knees now, clutching his bloody wrist and putting pressure on it.

“You bitch!” he spat. “I am a United States senator!”

“For now,” I agreed forebodingly. “Let’s keep it that way. You know what I want. You know what happens if I don’t get it.”

“God damn it, you shot me!”

“Well, technically it wasn’t me,” I pointed out with a shrug. “But I get your meaning. Probably should get going though, so many veins in the wrist. You’ll live if you get help straight away.” He growled at me and I patted his shoulder as I walked past. “See ya ‘round, Bill.”

I walked through the dark house, feeling satisfied. Finally, some closure to this whole affair. Now I could focus on August. Speaking of, I tapped the earpiece I was wearing as I stepped out of the house.

“All done?” came his voice over the wire.

“Yeah. That was clean. Thanks for the backup,” I murmured.

“Of course, baby.” I bit my lip and hoped he wasn’t still following me on his rifle’s scope. “I’ll see you in a bit?”

“Don’t be late,” I lilted, then removed the earpiece as Alain pulled up along the curb. I got in the car and sighed as he began driving to pick August up.

“Everything as you planned, *mademoiselle?*” he asked, eyeing me in the rearview mirror.

“He’d have to be extraordinarily stupid to mess this up,” I muttered, looking out the window as the dark suburbs rolled by. “We have all his modes of correspondence tapped, right?” He nodded. “Then we should be good. Let me know when the money’s in. Remember, it’s gonna be double what we were expecting.”

We fell into silence as he drove, and I rolled the coming conversation around in my head, reluctant to start it because of the shame I felt. Was I justified? Kinda. But August had been right. I still should have trusted my judgement of him. He had always been by my side. And I believed in his reasons.

“Alain… I’m sorry.”

He gave me a surprised look in the mirror. “For what, *mademoiselle?*”

“I didn’t know what to believe. All this was such a big secret, and it was so close to me… I freaked.”

“It’s alright. I may ‘ave felt the same, in your shoes.”

“You know I actually had a panic attack when I thought I’d lost you?” I was panting a bit just thinking about that time.

Alain’s eyes turned gentle, tinged with sorrow. “The others told me. But you will not lose me, *mademoiselle.* I will always be right by your side.”

I nodded, swallowing. “I–”

The car stopped, and August opened the trunk to put away his rifle, then got in next to me. “Thanks for picking me up,” he said. “You okay?”

“Yeah, I’m fine. And you don’t need to worry, the woman and the kid are safe.” His main concern with this plan had been my safety, and I’d had to assure him that Barnes wouldn’t just shoot me without giving me some kind of speech. His second concern was shooting through a wall and hurting Krista or Lisa.

“Good, good,” he sighed. “Gotta say, I’m not sure how to feel about playing vigilante.”

“You’re telling me it didn’t feel good shooting that piece of shit senator non-lethally?” I laughed.

He grimaced, inhaling sharply. “See, that was the satisfying part. Just can’t let my C.O. know about any of this.”

“Hell of a shot, by the way,” I remarked. He chuckled, and I watched him before continuing in a softer tone. “Hey. You keep so calm through all these crazy situations. Hurting people… killing people. How do you do it?”

“Well, I was trained by the best. At least something useful to come of our military industrial complex.” He sighed, looking out his own window. “I just think about the people important to me, every second of it. Trick myself into believing what I’m doing is right, and hope it doesn’t change how they look at me.”

“Why would that change? You’re still you.” I put my hand on his and he turned back to me, smiling half-heartedly.

“That’s super relevant in my case, huh?” he joked, and I smiled.

“Take us home, Alain,” I said, and August looked at me in surprise. I began playing with my hair, and his eyes darted around, trying to figure out where this was going. “So I was thinking… You know I’m a pretty transaction-oriented person.”

“Sure?”

“So I was wondering what I could give you for helping me with Barnes,” I continued, switching to a purr. This cute boy of mine actually gulped and shifted in his seat, and I smirked while scooting over to him.

“You don’t *need* to give me anything,” he stammered.

“So there’s nothing you want?” I whispered, my face inches from his.

“I didn’t say that,” he breathed, and I touched my lips to his. He responded by enthusiastically pulling me into his lap and pulling my head closer to kiss me more deeply. I wrapped my arms around his neck and moaned, and I heard the window separating us from Alain slide up into place. Tactful as always.

We made out until the car glided to a stop. Barely breaking apart, August opened the door and maneuvered us out, princess carrying me to my front door. I finally had to pause to unlock the front door, and then we were back at it, slowly stumbling around in the dark as he navigated us to my bedroom. Leaving the lights off, he set us down on the bed with me draped over his chest as we continued kissing. But this wasn’t the reward I was talking about.

I worked my way down his body. And his abs… Shit. Having a fit body was never one of my requirements, but goddamn was it sexy. Don’t judge me. I may have lingered a bit longer than was polite, before finally arriving at my destination. We took a moment to awkwardly remove his pants before I could admire him in all his glory.

Power. That was what every girl should feel when giving a blowjob. When done right, a girl held complete dominion over the guy. Of course, this obviously didn’t apply to skull-fucking. That was a separate matter altogether.

As I took him into my mouth, he groaned and threw his head back onto the pillows. With a little giggle, I started painting his entire rod with saliva. His knees bent to keep from quivering as I worked on him, giving special attention to his frenulum. He was muttering incoherently, which was a good sign. When you could turn even the smartest men into babbling idiots, you knew you were doing it right.

I wrapped my lips around him and began pumping them up and down, my tongue coiling around wildly. He gripped the sheets in fistfuls, writhing around in ecstasy before looking up to watch, panting in short breaths. Time for the coup de grâce. I swallowed his cock as deep as I could, and he gripped my head to hold me down. Then I turned my head, throat still impaled on him, doing a quarter-twist. He groaned loudly, and I suddenly ripped myself off him. Maybe that was a mistake, because I almost choked when it felt like my throat slammed shut from the sudden vacancy.

Immediately, August thrust his hips up, and I gripped his member to aim it properly. He coated my face with everything he had, and I moaned as some of it landed on my tongue, more dripping from my nose into my mouth. As prescribed, I viciously sucked the remnants out of his cock, and he whimpered before sighing in satisfaction.

We stayed like that while he recovered, and not to sound like a slut, but feeling his warmth on my face was so fucking hot. After a minute, he pushed himself up into a sitting position, admiring his handiwork in stunned silence. His dying erection gave a final few throbs at the sight of me.

“I’ll go get you a towel,” he murmured, rising to his feet.

“Thanks.” While I waited, I scraped his cream off my face and sucked it off my fingers, getting used to his taste.

When he came back, I was already mostly cleaned off. “Oh…” he breathed, deducing that I’d already swallowed his cum. His manhood throbbed again, and I took the damp towel from him to wipe my face, not wanting any residue drying on my face and giving me a stiff mask in the morning. I handed it back to him, and he left it in the bathroom before climbing back into bed with me. I undressed and lay down, and he pulled me into his arms.

“Good present?” I asked as he spooned me, my voice teasing.

“The best,” he admitted, before kissing the back of my shoulder. “Lexi?”

“Yeah?”

“I love you.”

I closed my eyes and sighed in contentment. “I love you too, August.”",Upset_Attention_7415,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Upset_Attention_7415/comments/sr36y3/behind_the_mask_chapter_19_fm_incest_cousincousin/,,Upset_Attention_7415,sr36y3,/r/Upset_Attention_7415/comments/sr36y3/behind_the_mask_chapter_19_fm_incest_cousincousin/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Upset_Attention_7415/comments/sr36y3/behind_the_mask_chapter_19_fm_incest_cousincousin/,0,2022-02-12

[CLAIM] Newfoundlander Separatists,"I'm aware this is a bit of a meme, but why not. Invalidate if you wish.

*""I say to you, that there is in operation at the present time a conspiracy to sell, and I use the word sell advisedly, this country to the Dominion of Canada. Watch in particular the attractive bait which will be held out to lure our country into the Canadian mousetrap. Listen to their flowery sales talk which will be offered to you; telling Newfoundlanders they’re a lost people, that our only hope, our only salvation, lies in following a new Moses into the promised land across the Cabot Strait.""*

*— Major Peter Cashin, 1948*

*The referendums of 1948 were a farce. Our country was purchased by the Dominion of Canada, and for what? 20 years on, and what have they done for us? Newfoundland and Labrador should once again become its own, independent country, proud and free, away from the grasp of Ottawa. And the Pink, White, and Green shall fly over the old capital of St. John's.*

In the 1970s, after a brief period of pro-Canadian sentiment, separatist sentiment began to rise once again, fairly slowly and disorganized, but increasing all the same. Newfoundland, with its own history independent of the Canadian state, has always been the odd province out, and the closeness of the independence referendum still has echoes. Even 20 years on, it is still only slightly over half of Newfoundlanders who think of themselves as Canadian instead of Newfoundlander.

With the cultural revival in Newfoundland alongside federal neglect of the province, the independence movement may continue to gain further strength within Newfoundland and Labrador. At the very least, Newfoundland should have more control over its own internal affairs, and we won't settle for being merely a Canadian puppet.",ColdWarPowers,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/sqwbo6/claim_newfoundlander_separatists/,CLAIM,Squeek99,sqwbo6,/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/sqwbo6/claim_newfoundlander_separatists/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/sqwbo6/claim_newfoundlander_separatists/,2,2022-02-12

Sister List,"Dear friends of the Imperium. I bid thee welcome to this post. 

For 2022 I've decided to start playing Warhammer. I fell down into the rabbit hole and I fell deep.

I've now started my second army for 2022(I have a problem). So if you haven't guessed it yet, I'm doing sisters. I absolutely love the look of sisters and their models and I cant wait to build &amp; paint them all. 

But me an my impatient ass have gotten myself into something of a pickle you see.   
I've singed up for my first ever beginner tournament and I intend to take the sisters to battle at my local shop.   


This small tournament will be at 1500 points for beginners as said, and I now need to build a competitive list for this event, I even intend to paint all the 1500 points until the 3rd of April. I've built somewhat of a list but struggle with the fine tuning of it and I do wonder If anyone of you have any input or suggestion on what I could add or adjust in this list. 

The list itself is based upon a 2000 points list made by John Lennon who won LSO. For anyone that wants to see the list its here in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-puRDZDXVw&amp;t=163s&amp;ab\_channel=AuspexTactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-puRDZDXVw&amp;t=163s&amp;ab_channel=AuspexTactics)

For the current list I have built with battlescribe. 

Its a bit of a eyesore to read(Sorry). Thank you for reading this far and hopefully help me out with sorting this list out. 

The emperor protects.

"As someone who has been very critical of the ""World"" films, I thought the Dominion trailer was really good","I'm still not a big fan of the general direction the series has gone in and I'm unsure Dominion will change that, but as a trailer I thought it was excellent, and I'm pleased they've managed to hold stuff back in terms of general plot and story. 

The FK trailers gave away the entire premise of the film before release, but they seem to have learned from their mistakes and promotion for  Dominion in general appears to be a lot more tasteful and restrained.

I'm not someone who particularly cares for cheap nostalgia baiting or bringing back old characters/dinosaurs for the sake of it, so I'm hoping Grant, Malcolm and Sattler have significant plot roles and the trailer seems to indicate that.

Ultimately, I'm still expecting another dumb-downed transformers-esque  mess of a film but the promotion hasn't completely dampened my expectations just yet.",JurassicPark,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/squnsq/as_someone_who_has_been_very_critical_of_the/,,crobek,squnsq,/r/JurassicPark/comments/squnsq/as_someone_who_has_been_very_critical_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/squnsq/as_someone_who_has_been_very_critical_of_the/,74,2022-02-12

Will 'Jurassic World' become the highest grossing trilogy of all time?,"As of now, Disney's Star Wars trilogy is the highest grossing trilogy ever at 4.469 billion dollars, followed by the MCU's Spider-Man at 3.791 (and counting). 

Jurassic World has grossed nearly 3 billion dollars with 2 movies. 
""Dominion"" needs to gross a little over 810 million dollars (again, excluding the money No Way Home has left) to become the 2nd highest grossing trilogy, and around 1.492 billion dollars to reach number one.

Now, Jurassic World will likely beat Spider-Man, but will Dominion be a big enough hit to reach Star Wars?

The Jurassic franchise seems to be pretty critic-proof at this point (Fallen Kingdom had a huge opening and strong legs even with a 47% RT critic score and a 48% audience score) and Dominion will feature two important selling points: the return of the OG cast and arguably one of the main concepts of the entire franchise - dinosaurs out in the world.

On the other hand, both Jurassic World movies were huge in China but the country is currently banning most Hollywood movies, especially those who seem to be a threat to local films on global rankings. That being said, Dominion has been heavily promoted during the Olympics so if any of 2022's big contenders gets a release in China, it's probably this one.
Also, we know that massive numbers are still possible during the pandemic (No Way Home), but I would still count covid as a possible issue.

Dominion will also face competition from Lightyear, released only a week later. Although both Jurassic World movies did very well against other Pixar films (Inside Out in 2015, Incredibles 2 in 2018).

Breakdown of Disney's Star Wars trilogy:
- Ep. VII: The Force Awakens - $2,064,615,817

"AITA for ""forcing"" my vegan views on my friend's child?","I (F25) decided to become vegan at the beginning of this year, I watched Dominion and just sat there crying the whole time pretty much, so decided I can't knowingly pay for animals to be treated like that anymore. 
Since then I've been doing really well and I feel a lot better, I cook a lot of my own food, usually stews, curries, chilli, and various other meals. 
My friend and her 6 year old came round my house for a catch up. The child asked if they could have something to eat so I offered to make him a sandwich and listed off some of the options in my house, peanut butter, jam, yeast extract, etc. 
He asked for ham, I explained that I don't keep meat in the house as I don't eat it so I wouldn't be able to make him a ham sandwich. He then started asking me why I don't eat it, so I explained that to make ham they have to kill pigs and I don't agree with killing animals for food. 
He got really upset and started crying and asking his mum why she feeds him dead animals, and my friend got really annoyed at me for telling him where food comes from. They left pretty quickly and my friend texted me later on calling me all sorts of names and telling me I shouldn't push my extremist views on her child who now is refusing to eat meat.
Maybe I should've just kept my mouth shut, but I feel like children have a right to know and understand what it is they're eating, and I only spoke about it because he was interested and asked me.

Dominion Base Game: Is it Broken?,"Full Disclosure: I'm working on a Strategy Guide for Dominion to be published on [MeepleMountain.com](https://MeepleMountain.com) at some time in the near future.  


NOTE: I'm seeking honest, impartial comments/strategies here, not looking to incite a flame war.  


I'm a big fan of Dominion. During Lockdown my weekly group and I have played often, first at [Dominion.games](https://Dominion.games) and now on Steam. (Where it's still in Beta, with the base game being free and a changing expansion or two being free to play per week.)

(The Steam port wins, btw)

This past week I tried a new strategy—one I've since come to learn is referred to as Big Money. In the Big Money scenario, a player (or players) spend all of their drawn money on (a) either more and/or 'bigger' when available money or (b) a Duchy (3VP) or Province (6VP).

I've played this out with members of my weekly group and against the Steam Hard AI. A dedicated Big Money tactic wins a strong majority of the time.

Is the base Dominion broken? Are there cards/a combination of cards that can win against Big Money? 

And do any of the expansions do a better job of allowing other players to play against Big  Money?

BattleTech: MegaLoad: TechManual: Clan Warsingers,"So, here's my take on the 'idols' in my BattleTech/Macross cross. the Warsingers of the Clans. If idol means less singing about culture and love to uncultured Zentraedi and more about singing Clan war hymns/cadences  while bashing the nearest uncultured Zentraedi's head in.

&amp;#x200B;

Clan Warsingers:

When the majority of the UN Spacy left together with General Aleksandr Kerensky's Exodus after the Amaris Civil War that resulted in the fall of the UN Government, they also brought along their techniques and culture with them. Over many years of isolation, they started to diverge from the Inner Sphere in culture when they became the Clans. The Warsingers are an example of how the culture of their Inner Sphere ancestors was altered to suit the purpose of the Clans.

When the Clans were formed by Nicolas Kerensky's hand, cultural pillars were altered to suit the new martial and caste based society of the Clans and the low resources of the planets within Clan space. Music and entertainment were produced for the different castes, ranging from sagas of Clan heroes and tales of heroism for all castes to the martial songs of their Warriors, resulting in the Warsingers. Clan Warsingers are a cross between a morale booster, a drill sergeant for Clan sibkos (a batch of Clan Trueborns) and an entertainer at formal Clan occassions. A Clan Warsinger has to be a very capable warrior in his or her choice of weapon (such in a Destroid, BattleArmor or in a Variable Fighter), chanting Clan war hymns in battle to keep morale up and terrify their opponents and also needs to be well versed in the history of their Clan, studying the Rembrance (the oral saga that serves as a mythological version of their history) and testing their combat skills in trials while also training their juniors.

&amp;#x200B;

 Rumours have it that Nicolas Kerensky took inspiration from a UN proposal for a 'Tactical Music Unit'  meant to disorient rogue Zentraedi fleets by exposing them through culture by music as a basis for the Warsingers. Though Zentraedi are less likely to gush over Warsingers as they are more likely to be terrified by them upon listening to their hymns.

&amp;#x200B;

*Yeah, right. When someone proposed that idea in Xaos using our in house idol group Walkure, I punched him in his mouth for suggesting that idea. Pop idols and other musicans are not meant for frontline combat, unless your're one of those crazy Clanners.*

&amp;#x200B;

Like most Clan related things, the first wide spread contact of the Warsingers was during the Clan Invasion, where they proved to be a nasty shock for the Inner Sphere alongside their advanced technology. Clan Smoke Jaguar in particular had earned a  reputation for their vicious behaviour, particulary amongst the Windermereans during the Sack of Windermere IV as well as other worlds in Clan Smoke Jaguar's invasion corridor. Their Warsingers in particular were their stuff of nightmares for the Windermereans as alongside the almost beastial chants of their Warsingers and Smoke Jaguar's almost bloodthirsty reputation, it was a Warsinger in a Queadlunn-Rau II-C that was reponsible for felling the White Knight in combat.

&amp;#x200B;

*Those guys were the stuff of nightmares. Heard that Clan Smoke Jaguar has been reformed by the ilKahn of the Clans and First Lord of the third United Nations Government, ilKahn Alaric Ward of Clan Wolf after the second United Nations Government wiped them out. Better hope that the other Clans in the Inner Sphere can help keep Smoke Jaguar restrained.*

&amp;#x200B;

Even after the Clans were beaten back and other events happened in the Periphery and Inner Sphere such as the Jihad that resulted in the formation of hybridized  Clan-Inner Sphere cultures and realms such as the  Rasalhauge Dominion (formed from the merger of Clan Ghost Bear and the Free Rasalhauge Republic), Clan Warsingers still have a place in society, both in the Clans and in those new cultures formed from merging Clan and Inner Sphere cultures,whether if they are singing sagas of Clan heroes in important occassions or singing Clan war hymns on the battlefield.

&amp;#x200B;

But boy, they can be really nasty when it comes to hecklers.*",macross,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/macross/comments/sqtb1l/battletech_megaload_techmanual_clan_warsingers/,Fluff,Cheemingwan1234,sqtb1l,/r/macross/comments/sqtb1l/battletech_megaload_techmanual_clan_warsingers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/macross/comments/sqtb1l/battletech_megaload_techmanual_clan_warsingers/,0,2022-02-12

"People of r/micronations, I know I'm a communist, but let me explain why r/micronations is this one big cancerhole in reddit itself:","1. Ideology choices: You can't even be a leftist there, you have to be a monarchist or a cringe libbie &amp; trust me, i've seen multiple cringe libbie and monarchist micronations that are

led by faggots who have the memory of a goldfish. Examples of cringe libbie &amp; monarchist micronations are: Basileus of Cimbrun (who is a fuckin' fake greek micronationalist that looks like a pedo) &amp; Dominion of Vancouver Island (aka the guy who pretends to own all of Vancouver Island).                                                                               

Sure, there are communist micronations led by kiddos in america who are cringe, but that doesn't neccessarily mean that all communist micronations are cringe,

there are some based ones: Pangeria, Stravonska, Krusstania and many more. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. The idiocy of the people on the subreddit, they don't see a problem with fascist micronations, when fascism is way more cringe like bruh, like they're retard micronations. Your expectations are unrealistic, how do you expect people to change from being communist to libbie which is cringe?

Also there is this saying: ""Communist micronations, based or cringe, should be mocked/bullied until they change their mind."" 

Screw that man, what does education have to do with mocking. Educating means teaching someone how to do something, mocking is making fun of something/someone in a cruel way.

It's so stupid, it's so dumb.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Alternatives for r/micronations: Now, if you guys want alternatives for r/micronations, there are discord servers for micronations that are not cringe and have decent people.

I'd highly recommend joining InterMicronational Chat and A MicroWiki for Jusitce. I hope you enjoy the severs!

&amp;#x200B;

4. Conclusion: Now my conclusion is that r/micronations is a tumor and a cancerhole at the same time, I hope people can understand it and not be a braindead person who just downvotes the post then leaves.

Edit: now you maybe asking: ''If you hate r/micronations then why are you posting here?'' Answer: Because I thought r/micronations was not cringe, until I realized that its just cringe with the libbies and monarchist fags.

[LFP][5e][Paid] Professional DM looking for play testers! Module Included after test.,"#  Players Wanted!

I'm  looking for a consistent group of adventurers to help play test a new  homebrew campaign set in its own custom 5E based world.  The **Summerset**  campaign takes place in the remote mountainous region of Summerset,  located in the country of Khor'Gar on the continent of Galantäs.  This  formerly prosperous mining settlement of the legendary ""Lightshine"" ore  has been beset by new and old foes that all struggle for dominion over  the land.

You begin as a group of  recent applicants to the Flaming Fist, a group of mercenaries that have  political ties to the port town of Darven's Din, located along the  northern border of Khor'Gar and the Dwarven empire of Khum Thurum. The  city is generally regarded as the gateway to the North.   Many  adventurers vie for membership of the Flaming Fist, an organization that  has the reputation of having members that are either new to the  organization or very rich and powerful.  The Flaming Fist is sending  your party to Summerset to help the local guild overseer with the  problem of an Immature Green Dragon that has harassed the land.

Along  the way you discover the troubles of the people of Summerset, are given  a chance to assist with other jobs and quests available to an  enterprising young party.  Great riches and fame await!

# About the DM

I've  been a DM since the early 1980's along with a close group of friends  that began with ""Advanced Dungeons and Dragons"" through 3e.  I took a  break for about 15 years and picked back up with 5e about five years  ago.  I've run a number of games on Roll20 and at my local game shop,  but am transitioning to FoundryVTT.  I'm a dedicated DM that can easily  switch between ""Sandbox"" mode and ""Guide"" depending on the party.  My  role is to give you the best experience possible, make a fun and  exciting adventure and provide unexpected twists and an engrossing  story.  I love working with new players and experienced players alike.

This  campaign is a work of love and I'm looking to eventually publish it.   Since this is a playtest, I will be charging $5 USD (payable via Venmo  or PayPal) per session, and each session will last 3.5 to 4 hours.   While this play test is a paid session, I will be sharing part or all of  the campain with the party based on the conditions below:

* Players  that attend 10 sessions will receive a copy of the first 5 player  levels worth of content.  All notes, quests, maps and additional details  for characters starting at level 1 through level 5 will be given to you  for your time.
* For  Players that attend 20 sessions will receive a final copy of the  campaign, including all notes, quests, maps and additional detail.

I  will be using content from the official 5e materials an from several  Kobold Press items such as Tome of Beasts and Creature Codex.

# Play Testers

Since  this is a play test, I will ask for a bit of additional feedback from  you.  Please be willing to provide feedback on individual sessions, the  material, flow, the story, etc.  My hope is to make this an engrossing  story and introduction to the greater world that I am introducing.  I  don't expect everything to be completely smooth, we might discover that  certain encounters are far to easy, some far too hard, some puzzles  might be simple, others hard, and we'll deal with those as we encounter  them as a group.  Your input is key!

If  you are interested in  playing as a tester, please click the link below  to fill out the party application, and I will get back to you  individually.   Once we have a party of 6 selected, we'll do two free  sessions to setup new characters and test your access to FoundryVTT, and  to do a meet and greet with everyone to make sure everyone is  comfortable and ready to begin.  The regular weekly session will be  determined based on everyone's availability.

Any recommendations for cooperative deck- or engine-building games?,"Title, pretty much. My GF and I recently got Wingspan, and we really like it. The only problem is that I've spent way too many hours playing both Dominion and MtG, so I have a really unfair advantage. We're both pretty competitive too, so it can lead to some strife if one of us demolishes the other at something too consistently.

A quick Google search turned up a few options, but I'm not sure which ones to spend the time + money on. Top priority is being fun with two players, but if it can support more, that's great too! Also, I think we shouldn't go much heavier than Wingspan (at least not right away).

Why the outrage over cat abuse and not mass animal slaughter? There's a simple answer,"Because most meat-eaters don't know what actually goes on in a slaughterhouse.

I recently became vegan and noticed in debates and online forums that we vegans are often baffled and angry over the hypocrisy people show when they get outraged over an isolated incident of pet abuse, but continue to eat meat.

But there's a simple answer for this: most meat-eaters don't know that cows, chickens, sheep, and other animals slaughtered for meat can experience emotions as we do, and therefore suffer immense physical and psychological pain and abuse when they're separated from their brothers and sisters, beaten, branded, castrated, gassed, and even when they see their fellow animals suffering.

If you ask a meat-eater how animals are slaughtered, most of them will have some vague, misinformed idea: "" uh they get a quick shot in the head and it's over, right""?

Until three days ago, I too was ignorant of animal suffering, especially in factory farming. Then I watched Dominion, and I pretty much became a vegan overnight.

My point is that I think most meat-eaters are not cruel, unempathethic brutes who couldn't care less about a calf spending the few days of its life missing its mother before getting hideously slaughtered. They're just ignorant. We know how animals are really treated before they make their way to the slaughterhouse and what happens after, but many meat-eaters don't.

Since this is the case, wouldn't the best way to bring up the topic of veganism and hopefully shift someone's perspective be something like:

""Hey, I saw this crazy documentary the other day, and learned how animals are actually slaughtered. What they go through it's crazy.""

Rather than: ""Hey I'm a vegan, and I was wondering if you've ever thought about the morality of eating meat?""

I could be wrong, what do you guys think?",vegan,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/sqk421/why_the_outrage_over_cat_abuse_and_not_mass/,,iamhoomanmale,sqk421,/r/vegan/comments/sqk421/why_the_outrage_over_cat_abuse_and_not_mass/,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/sqk421/why_the_outrage_over_cat_abuse_and_not_mass/,13,2022-02-12
Doom Slayer's Testament," ""In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him... the Doom Slayer.""

""Tempered by the fires of Hell, his iron will remained steadfast through the passage that preys upon the weak. For he alone was the Hell Walker, the Unchained Predator, who sought retribution in all quarters, dark and light, fire and ice, in the beginning and the end, and he hunted the slaves of Doom with barbarous cruelty; for he passed through the divide as none but demon had before.""

""And in his conquest against the blackened souls of the doomed, his prowess was shown. In his crusade, the seraphim bestowed upon him terrible power and speed, and with his might he crushed the obsidian pillars of the Blood Temples. He set forth without pity upon the beasts of the nine circles. Unbreakable, incorruptible, unyielding, the Doom Slayer sought to end the dominion of the 

dark realm.""

""The age of his reckoning was uncounted. The scribes carved his name deep in the tablets of Hell across eons, and each battle etched terror in the hearts of the demons. They knew he would come, as he always had, as he always will, to feast on the blood of the wicked. For he alone could draw strength from his fallen foes, and ever his power grew, swift and unrelenting.""

""None could stand before the horde but the Doom Slayer. Despair spread before him like a plague, striking fear into the shadow-dwellers, driving them to deeper and darker pits. But from the depths of the abyss rose the Great One, a champion mightier than all who had come before. The Titan, of immeasurable power and ferocity. He strode upon the plain and faced the Doom Slayer, and a mighty battle was fought on the desolate plains. The Titan fought with the fury of the countless that had fallen at the Doom Slayer's hand, but there fell the Titan, and in his defeat the shadow horde were routed.""

""And in his terrible rancor between worlds and through time, the Hell Walker found the wretch who shall not be named, but in his heresy was loyal to his evil cause. The wretch adorned the Doom Slayer in a mighty armor, wrought in the forges of Hell, impenetrable and unyielding. With sword and shield of adamantine strength, the Doom Slayer set to banishing all that were left unbroken by his savagery to the void.""

""Yet as the mighty Titan fell and dread engulfed the armies of Doom, the demon priests of the Blood Temples laid a trap to capture this scourge of Hell. Insatiable, even by the vanquishing of the Great One, the Hell Walker sought prey in the tombs of the Blood Keep. And blinded by his fervor, the lure drew him in. The priests brought down the temple upon the Doom Slayer, and in his defeat entombed him in the cursed sarcophagus. The mark of the Doom Slayer was burned upon his crypt, a warning to all of Hell that the terror within must never be freed. There he lies still, and ever more, in silent suffering.""",copypasta,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/sqsvp0/doom_slayers_testament/,,CreepySympathy,sqsvp0,/r/copypasta/comments/sqsvp0/doom_slayers_testament/,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/sqsvp0/doom_slayers_testament/,2,2022-02-12
The Striking Similarities Between Jurassic World and Fantastic Beasts Trilogies Ahead of the Releases of Jurassic World Dominion and The Secrets of Dumbledore,"With the 3rd chapters of Jurassic World and Fantastic Beasts franchises releasing soon, I decided to compare the films in these soon-to-be trilogies and noticed several striking similarities.
Specifically, the release schedules, critical reception, box office performance and the overall direction of the series share quite similar patterns.

### Release Years

Apart from the 1st films, the entries in the trilogies will have the same release years, and the gap between 2nd and 3rd films will be longer for both series.

|       |  Jurassic World  |  Fantastic Beasts  |
|-------|:----:|:----:|
| 1st film  | 2015 | 2016 |
| 2nd film  | 2018 | 2018 |
| 3rd film  | 2022 | 2022 |

### Critical Reception

First entries in both trilogies had positive critical reception among both audiences and critics.

| Score                       | Jurassic World 1 | Fantastic Beasts 1 |
|-----------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| RT Critics                  |  71 |  74 |
| RT Audience                 |  78 |  79 |
| IMDB                        | 7.0 | 7.3 |
| Metacritic                  |  59 |  59 |
| CinemaScore                 |  A  |  A- |
| PostTrak Positive           |  -  | 90% |
| PostTrak Definite Recommend | 65% | 74% |

The second entries had mixed reception and were panned critically.

| Score                       | Jurassic World 2 | Fantastic Beasts 2 |
|-----------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| RT Critics                  |  47 |  36 |
| RT Audience                 |  48 |  54 |
| IMDB                        | 6.2 | 6.5 |
| Metacritic                  |  51 |  52 |
| CinemaScore                 |  A- |  B+ |
| PostTrak Positive           | 82% | 83% |
| PostTrak Definite Recommend |  -  | 69% |

### Box Office Performance

While Fantastic Beasts had markedly lower overall box office gross, the pattern of drops from the 1st to the 2nd film was very similar to that of Jurassic World films.
The table below shows the drops in the North American market:

| Franchise        | 1st Film NA | 2nd Film NA |  NA Drop  |
|------------------|:--------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| Jurassic World   |   652.4  |   417.7  | -35.97% |
| Fantastic Beasts |   234.0  |   159.6  | -31.79% |

And in the international markets:

| Franchise        | 1st Film OS | 2nd Film OS | OS Drop |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Jurassic World   |    1018.1   |    892.7    | -12.32% |
| Fantastic Beasts |    580.0    |    495.3    | -14.60% |

### Direction of the Sequels

After lackluster 2nd entries in the series, both Jurassic World and Fantastic Beasts are now forced to rely on heavy nostalgia for their 3rd films. *Jurassic World Dominion* does so with the return of the old cast, while *Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore* is shifting the focus of the story towards Albus Dumbledore and Hogwarts.",boxoffice,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/sqfa0f/the_striking_similarities_between_jurassic_world/,:other: Other,LordOfRight,sqfa0f,/r/boxoffice/comments/sqfa0f/the_striking_similarities_between_jurassic_world/,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/sqfa0f/the_striking_similarities_between_jurassic_world/,12,2022-02-12

I have a theory for Dominion,So in the trailer at the end we saw everyone looking at the giga. Also I’m pretty sure everyone is thinking the Rexy will kill the giga but as we saw in the flashback thing Rexy wasn’t strong enough before. So she might need something to help. It could be blue but then it would basically be the indominus fight pt2. So I think a Spino might come in and help Rexy. If the Spino isn’t at this point in the movie I hope it will still show up.,JurassicPark,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/sqqt3b/i_have_a_theory_for_dominion/,Jurassic World: Dominion,MrWong247,sqqt3b,/r/JurassicPark/comments/sqqt3b/i_have_a_theory_for_dominion/,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/sqqt3b/i_have_a_theory_for_dominion/,55,2022-02-12

I have loved the Jurassic park franchise since I first saw the film when I was younger and I'm excited for dominion. However after Fallen Kingdom gave quite a few things away before the movie I decided that I was going to do what I could to prevent that possibility with Dominion. Not knowing about certain scenes in my opinion will allow my eventual viewing to be even better.

**Bio**: In the beginning of time, when the Eight Realms of the Divine were first being formed around the material multiverse, there was only one family. Half of its members were of pure spirit and intention, and the other corrupted to the core by malice, both serving as the wielders of the most basic yet powerful of concepts: **Good** and **Evil**. They were paragons of this power, but as their ranks descended the more their imperfections came about, showing themselves as the ages went by. This was especially true for their servants, who either born from the souls of spreading mortal beings or forged in the realms themselves, suffered imperfections the most. Demons would sometimes abandon their slaughter and attempt to get away, Angels would feel conflicted and leave their post, and everyone in the middle was left to wander. But before the least perfect would fall away from their post, the most perfect of those outside this Divine Family would have to fall first. To his kin at the time he had no name, but today his name is **Asmodeus**. When he was first forged from the light of Heaven he was but another of the one hundred nameless Seraphim, the grandest yet most dangerous weapons of the Heavens. in the early days of time, Asmodeus served as the guardian of the Fields, the outermost circle of Heaven. But when lesser angels from the 2nd circle arrived to check on him, they found him missing, and ordered a long and arduous search for the Seraphim. When they finally found him, they had discovered he had committed crimes against Heaven that to this day remain known to only the other Seraphim who still remember the early age and the members of the Divine Family. Asmodeus quickly destroyed those who had found him, but in short time he was found again by many of his other kin. A great battle occurred, destroying dozens of young planets and slaying at least one of the Seraphim who sought to tame their rogue kin, in fact the first ever Seraphim to ever be killed, all without regret. Something had happened to him to lead him away from perfection, and for his great treason he would be punished in a most fitting manner.

The Fallen Seraphim was eventually restrained and brought before **The Father**, the highest power within the known Multiverse of the Celestials other than the true paragon of benevolence. But even the most benevolent of beings knew that this Seraphim had no chance of redemption from the coldness and the violence which they had inflicted on many young worlds. As a slight mercy he would live but live with the weight of the sins that they had committed, revoked of most of their powers and banished into the depths of the domain of their enemy to be punished. So he was sent, kicked out into the interdimensional void between worlds and left to sink to the bottom of reality, eventually ending up in the 8th layer of Hell. There, for 10,000 years his form would be further degraded and corrupted by the tortures of the fiends, rendered apart and put back together many times over. However, the punishment was meant to be eternal, until the interest of another member of the Divine Family fell upon him. One day, he was brought down to the final layer of Hell, the Womb, and sent into the dark and infernal capital, the Unnamable Fortress. He was brought up to the very top level of its dark heights, brought into the presence of **The Mother**, the infernal counter to the very bring which brought him to this fate. It was there where she would ""lighten"" his sentence in exchange that he serves the powers of Hell for the rest of his time. Broken and without hope, he accepted the offer, and in but a moment his final fall into the clutches of the damned came about, and with it came his name. Henceforth he would be known as Asmodeus, restored of most of his power and granted new ones. He would be capable of changing his form once again, and begin to favor a more humanoid form to avoid the attention of his former Celestial kin. The apocalyptic powers he held were more or less gone, but in exchange he would become a master of infernal and arcane powers. And to finish it off, he would serve as the subordinate and advisor to **The Son**, the counter to **The Daughter** of Heaven and ruling as the master of the armies of Hell. With his new powers and position, he once again felt no regret for the acts he committed, even if a being as wise as he would know the dangers such feelings that he held.

Throughout the ages, Asmodeus's seemingly innate tendencies of malice began to show themselves in Hell and beyond. During some of the earliest Hell Wars, while Celestial forces engaged infernal hordes, he would reveal his strength to the defenseless and utterly annihilate any he saw. Those who he let live would live in ruin and in desecrated lands, pushed to the edge and plummeting to their own demise. Even when he was not in combat, the aura of dread and corruption he produced from his powers were enough to turn entire cities into followers of Hellish powers. Mere shards of his being were enough to ascend warlocks into an apex of dark power or create long-term rifts into Sub-space from which other fiends may come for the slaughter. However, he wasn't just a mindless killer, but cold, calculating, and cautious. He made sure to either assure the destruction of Celestial forces that encountered him or avoid them all together and remain in the shadows of Hell. Speaking of which, Asmodeus' position of power allowed him to do many things that no mere Demon Lord or even Archdevil could do. One of the first things he did was help in the creation of the **Circle of 13**, a gathering of the Son, Asmodeus, and eleven of the most powerful Demon Lords in all of Hell. While these Demons still serve under their respective archdevils, the priority of orders is surpassed by the Son and, you guessed it, Asmodeus. This circle serves the purpose of organizing major occurrences within and beyond the nine layers of Hell: Major Incursions, Organization of resources, Investigations against ""counter-heresies"", and most prominently choosing which lesser Demon Lords to promote to true Demon Lords (most of the time). Asmodeus' position also allows him to make more direct decisions, acting as the direct advisor to the Son in decisions both big and small. While often times his words are ignored or sometimes violently rebuked, many other times the Son listens to the malicious plots which Asmodeus whispers between his horns. One of the few imperfections he still holds from his past life is to sometimes recommend temporary truces with the Celestials in dire times for both groups. Of course, this really only happened twice so far during to very specific events: *The Astral War* and *the War of Faith and Metal*.

The first time Asmodeus did this, it resulted in his discovery by the Celestials. During the Astral War, he saw the Astral Lords as a threat to their dominion over Hell, and thus thought to make the process easier by making alliances with the other divine beings of the Multiverse. The Son despised the idea but accepted under one condition: that Asmodeus himself be fighting on the frontlines, *with the Celestials*. At first, Asmodeus was annoyed at the prospect, though he accepted as well and acted much like a general would against the quickly forming armies of the Astral. Most of the time he would just command his fiends to follow his plans while the Celestials did their own thing, and anyone who got to close would be consumed by a pillar of fire. The Celestials nearby were, obviously, suspicious of him, though were a bit busier in dealing with the rather undisciplined Archangel that commanded them into wild charges. However, things changed when *Zilara*, Astral Lordess of War and Chaos breeched through their defenses and was on the verge of killing one of the Celestials subordinate commanders. That was when Asmodeus revealed his true form in a desperate measure to push back Zilara and her armies. However, upon this surprise reveal, the Celestial which he intended to save saw who he was and struck at him before he could explain. A hellish rebuke sent them back before he fled back to the depths of Hell with the majority of his forces. His return would be one of disgrace, insulted by the Son himself, with the whole thing intended as a punishment towards Asmodeus to teach him his rightful place. After that day, Asmodeus would be slowly degraded of much of his image after that, with the 13th Hell Wars' end seeing him defeated by an Archangel, something he thought of as below him beforehand. But all that changed when the War of Faith and Metal came along, when Asmodeus, after so long, *had some fun*. While he remained belittled by the Sons' rejection of alliance against the Mechani, he was soon vindicated when the Mother directly ordered him to enact such an alliance to ""prevent general disarray"". Furthermore, in the latter half of the War, Asmodeus himself began to participate in the many battles against increasingly desperate Mechani forces. One of his favorite moments was when he, the Archdevil Tiamat, and a number of other powerful fiends single-handedly demolished a massive army of Mechani invading the Inferno. He nearly destroyed High Warden Betarus, but let him live out of a shred of pity and the arrival of [High Warden Alphara](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVerseSetting/comments/pw8rd0/bio_alphara_seer_of_mechanis/). But Asmodeus knew well he was already on the same path that he took long ago. After the success he achieved through the War of Faith and Metal, he has seen a slow increase of activity in the material world. 

His ambition is known for growing without a seeming end in sight, and even if not directly his influence can bring about great destruction. Among the most holy of powers he is a figure who while going under many names are names whose very whisper can be the line between purity and sin. His influence over more than a few warlocks of his own design across time and space act as extensions of his will, a will matched by own a scarce few other beings in existence. But it is by his merits that the Celestials destined he is to fall even beyond the depths of Hell. Even if utterly unrecognizable and corrupted by infernal power, he is still part of the blood which made Heaven itself, blood which makes him ever still imperfect. Like the imperfections that made him turn to evil, the imperfections of his Celestial self shall cause him to make mistakes, that over time will add up. But for now, the dark and terrible minister of Hell has lots of time to spare, and perhaps just as much to kill.

**Allies**: The Fiends (Particularly those in power and those part of the Circle of 13)

**Enemies**: The Celestials, Most of the other divine beings and their allies

""*Oh how you seek perfection in your heart and soul, searching for the right path. But here is a hard truth, that path is one which mortal eyes are unlikely to see. Even I, a primordial being formed from the mere moments of the dawn of time fell so deep into Hell that I was forever changed. When you eventually fall you will tear yourself apart in sorrow and pain, deny yourself the tortures you deserve, and plead to me to spare you. But while I am familiar with such a fall from grace, I make it a loyal policy to not show you a pit of pity. Why? Because you won't need it when you finally realize that it's so, so good to be bad.*""

- Asmodeus to a Servoan Cleric of Azrial in a visage, who later committed suicide, a lone temple in central Servoa, 1761 E.A.",TheVerseSetting,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVerseSetting/comments/sqkr0p/bio_asmodeus_the_fallen_seraphim/,Bio,Benster_ninja,sqkr0p,/r/TheVerseSetting/comments/sqkr0p/bio_asmodeus_the_fallen_seraphim/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVerseSetting/comments/sqkr0p/bio_asmodeus_the_fallen_seraphim/,0,2022-02-12
[Futa4A2A] A Series of Prompts For You Sweetie,"(1 A Walk Through Mother's Garden)
you come to a very popular club for the first time a club named ""Mother's Garden: Sanctuary for The Soul"". you see fluorescent lights coming from the doors, tall Amazonian women as bouncers. You wait in line for what  seems like forever then, you feel a deep sensation in your chest as the club's music goes on. deep bass vibrating you as a whole. As you finally make It in you smell a sweet scent going throughout the halls and It growing stronger as you walk further down. You see see tall gate, one so beautiful it made you question if you've died and went to the afterlife. As you get to the gate the tall doors open slowly, a quick flash of light then, you see oceans of people and  dancers on platforms above. You walk around the club looking up to see  large screens showing dancers up close, you hear talking of an appearance, the club's owner, you see others point up at a screen,sweet voice resonates throughout the club. 

""Hello sweethearts~ welcome to My Garden~~""

Her voice was so calming as if she was goddess. She speaks again

""You know it's time for me to give you all a show~~"" 

A platform goes up from the center of the dance floor, as soon as it reached the highest point everyone could see a very tall woman, dressed with a long white coat with bright purple fur. The huge screens around the club showed a close up, she smiled, her deep fluorescent eyes shined they seemed to have all the colors under the sun. Soon she began to sing, she sang for hours while the platform lowered, you found yourself close, you were right in front of her, she looked down and smiled at you, blowing a kiss you felt as if she was playing with your soul. She sang her last few songs and then, was gone. You knew you were coming back again after that experience. After about 30 mins you start making your way out the gates. But you stop, you feel a deep desire, your life feels empty. You walk back in, seeing her walk up a set of stairs. she makes eye contact, her deep blue eyes flash. A bouncer taps your shoulder and asks

""Wanna see her?"" 

She waits for your response*

(I love playing this out with someone, I love the idea of getting rid of minds through the tech I've attained  or enticing someone to give their lives to me through small battles of resistance where I inevitably take you as mine, their very being given lost and deleted; replaced with a new mentality, one that is made to worship me.

This is could be a more different setting than a Cyberpunk Dystopia, if you want we could talk about it)

(2 The Pleasant Valley Mistress' Secret)
You're a powerful individual at a banquet having fun making memories then soon you'd hear whispereds of a  tall amazonian woman arriving at the celebration. one from Pleasant Valley, she stood tall, taller than any woman, almost taller that most men, she looked down to people, spoke to them in a soft loving tone. You heard of her occasionally, The Mistress Of Pleasant Valley. You heard of the stories, the legends of individuals doing all that they could to experience her domain, that she stole souls from their bodies, hid them in her eyes and used them to transform herself and the person she took. She would tell many of the people attending that my Valley isn't her kingdom, it's more of a place where people become their trueselves, and that the stories are all make believe.
She saw many look to her in awe, others laughed and told her that it was strange that she walked around with her eyes closed, she would laugh telling them that she knew it seemed silly, she mentioned how her eyes were sensitive to light, how her eyes weren't special and shouldn't be seen. She  had fun, yet she had an came looking for the king or queen anyone of power to....speak and make conversation with. She bumped into you on purpose to get your attention and turned ""I'm so sorry, please..."" She opens her eyes, you saw many colors flow in them, her eyes glowing brighter as you looked deeper. you for a moment were entranced, you saw the strands of colour begin to split, you could count many different colors each more vibrant than the last, yet your immense power made you resist. ""Forgive me~"" she waited to see what you'd do given that you've met her powerful gaze, yet you don't know what I could do. Were the legends true...?

( I love the idea of soul stealing or enticing someone to give their lives to me, draining them of their essence, energy,power(s) reading how weak they feel and how the loss/draining is affecting them. I  would use their strength and essence to empower myself and  make them into mine. This one mainly goes into my love for taking power and a kingdom from a ruler. 

This can be in any setting Modern or Fantasy (a favorite) Cyberpunk Dystopia (another favorite) any setting is up for discussion.
 
We could also change it in some ways, maybe you're my  son or daughter and have gained much power over the years and I just drain it all to keep you under me and I use it against you to make you subservient. Who knows~

(3 Kneel Before The Gilded Cow)

You are an explorer, smart, cunning, adventurous, with overwhelming curiosity. You did research for years and made a tremendous discovery, the location of the Golden Calf. You've needed this even though it doesn't fully go along with your main mission of God's existence it still indicates that the Bible had some truth. You invested more time and money and were able to pinpoint it's exact location it seemed to be I the middle of nowhere but you didn't mind taking chances. So you set out to a barren desert searching far and wide. Soon you find what seems to be a temple, you began to explore the deep caves and corridors making it to an enormous room with gold lining the ceiling and floors. You see a a set of stairs with a throne, and atop the throne was the Golden Calf! Your excitement couldn't be contained so you'd find yourself running up to the tall throne to see it up close. The Bovine looked more human like than in most depictions, the statue had horns and the face of a cow, however the body looked curvy and had large breasts The feet were hooved and she had human hands. This just looked like a strange sex deity maybe one for women to worship? The more you looked the more you saw her beauty, her form seemed to be held back by her clothes, she looked so....voluptuous, she looked like if she was a real person her body would be soft and squishy. You continued to set up a small camp and connect things to the statue, and while the you were finishing up you hear...laughing? No..Giggles...from where? You look back at the statue and shake your head, thinking there's no way the cow is alive, God saw it as just meer metal nothing special this is just a statue nothing more! But as you continued working you began to smell something, a more...sweet smell it came from the statue? You thought your mind was playing tricks just heat getting to you! Right? Then as you continued to work you took peeks at the statues chest, thinking about how perverted the people were. But in one glance back you see that the statue moved!!! It's hand is squeezing breast and the other seems to be beckoning with one finger, everything seems to be off, as you work your curiosity grows, is there another God? Is the cow truly a divine thing? You walk closer waiting to see if there's something truly under there living and breathing. You see the disc between the cows horns glow and that glow slowly trails down its body, the Godly Bovine has awaken and she looks to you, she licks her lips and smiles her eyes shined bright she was lustful. She stayed atop her throne and continued to beckon with one finger ""Come to me adventurous one, you seek I. 
I alone am the one true God. You must obey, Come close, Experience the Golden Calf's dominion~""

(This one mainly explores Mental Changes to make you into a perfect servant, making you renounce your God and take me as your new divine ruler. This will involve a anthro cow transformation, however I'm willing to do just hucow. This is promt does go along with a ref, so if needed I'll provide)

(3 A Succubus' Secret~)
You're asleep, as a soft pink portal opens down your hall. a tall Amazonian succubus futa smells you and your sweet soul, A perfect fit for a toy that she'll use for all of eternity. 
     She soon makes it to your room after choosing one of your lovely family members as a vessel, she phased through your door and began smiling looking at your body and feeling overwhelming amount of ecstasy from thinking about all of the things she'll do to you. 
    Her hand glows a deep purple, she caressed your side softly and soon your lower torso on your pelvic area giving you a womb tattoo style brand, claiming you. She bit her lip, eyes glowing brighter her unique cock throbbing and dripping pre cum.
   She soon began to stroke she began to count down to herself with each stroke counting the seconds until she claims you.
   She exhales, mist coming out, soon she gets more excited and more mist comes through the room, she bit her lip harder excited for what's to come 
  Her eyes glowing brighter, cock throbbing and dripping liters of pre cum, ready to consume your soul.

She gets an intense euphoria from what your body will endure as soon as you awake. Her tail sways, cock throbs, hands ready, to steal your soul and make you her dumb bimbo whore forever~

I hope you enjoyed that one sweetie, I thought leaving who I possessed would let you think of /who/ I possessed, maybe your partner, your crush, or better yet your sister or mother~? Could this all be a summoning gone wrong or maybe a summoning gone right~, we could work this all out, get all your thoughts running~

(New, What You Bulit Up I'll Be Mine)

You're a powerful individual, you built your company from the ground up. You had many rivals and people you erased from the eyes of the people with your Supreme knowledge and mind. You had individuals who you used to look up to, work for you. 
      You attained true power with your ground breaking discoveries. However there was one who still serves as a whole lot of problems to you and your company. A woman whose name made you enraged, a woman who's been making your life more difficult by the second. Your seat as the top of the one percent has been challenged many times by others but not one like her. Andrea Lovinia Noviana, that woman who's company seemed to be nothing more than rocks, land marking, mining and gemstone exports; started to make its way to toppling your own. 
     You constantly gave passive aggressive remarks whether it be online or at  gatherings you would use your status and power to try and down play her discoveries. You recently had a run in with her, her height towering over you and others, you were angry at the kind words they were saying about her ""the kind and gentle giantess"" and ""the woman of large stature and innovations"" even though you were the one who'd win ever award. 
     This specific gathering made your blood boil. This time they denied your annual speech, the community usually had you just go up and speak, mainly because you would win every single award, so to make it easy; they just replace the plaque giving section with a speech from you, a platform you'd use as a means to down play any new business man or woman, one you'd use to make your statement that you were the top of the food chain. However they made a decision for someone else to give a speech after YOU give them the award.  So you decided to accept it, you went up to the stage as they called for all to bear witness.  when you walked up and opened the Golden letter on the podium your heart dropped. It was her, but you couldn't make a fool of yourself so you reluctantly said.
   ""And the award for tremendous discovery success and leadership among peers and colleagues. Andrea Lovinia Noviana"" You were engaged that the community made you do that, they made you congratulate a rival whose existence makes you more that furious; an individual who made you look like a laughing stock, it may just be one award but that one award made you look like someone who has a weakness. So as time let on and she won more you tried to figure out how to topple her.
    Soon you'd hear a knock on your door of your mansion, and as you opened the door....It was her.
She smiled and laughed and looked down at you see seemed...taller? ""Hello my sweet, I came by to ask something of you would you be so kind as to let me have a word?"" This maybe it! Your chance to run her into the ground.

(This goes along with my love for taking power especially Status, I'd like to maybe go with a nice little power struggle mentally and physically. You possibly slowly giving in to being under me, and soon just giving all of your assets to me company and all)


(New, Hero's Fall)
You're a strong adventurer who's known by all a hero that can stand up to any challenge. You've slain dragons, dark lords and liberated lands; you took down tyranny and changed many people. Soon you took notice of a small village that had a yearning for a new beginning, they've been pillaged and burned out; then they've been given a bigger quarrel, a powerful dragon. You traveled days and nights to the village and finally you saw it, it had a tall gate and it's sign burned. You walked through as if it was a ghost town, you saw no people, no sign of life and as you went through the town's square you met with one person; their eyes glazed over and mind lost ""are..you a hero?...ones who's come to save the land?"" They pointed towards a far of mountain and stayed like a statue. ""That's were the dragon's lair is...legend says that our people were used to satiate the dragon's hunger, no one returns and there's no trace of anyone. Hero's have came across this old kingdom and tried to save it, but none have prevailed. So you made it your mission to slay the dragon and add another achievement to your growing heroics

(This one will explore an seasoned adventure, the class and race will be up to you, they'll all meet the same end, as my brood mother and mate, I love the idea of one slowly changing larger than their body can handle, bones reshaping and form changing, we could possibly think of something more all is up for interpretation~)

Looking for one additional player for Campaign [5e] [Online] [Talespire] [Tuesdays]," 

Hello everyone!

I'm a DM currently starting up my second weekly homebrew campaign looking for an additional player  to fill our table. My first campaign is currently on hiatus for a few months while one of our players is away on paternity leave.

I have been using table top simulator to run these games for the most part, but have decided to try out Tale Spire for this time around to see how we like it; so it will be required to partake in the campaign.

The campaign itself is a town-building campaign set on an uncharted frontier. The party will explore the ancient wilderness in search for a newly discovered mineral in a bid to establish a supply chain back to one of three factions - all while managing the new land's first settlement. Face down the dangers of the wilds and navigate the murky politics of three sovereignties vying for dominion over this new world! (Full Campaign Synopsis Available on Our Discord).

Most Likely looking at Tuesdays 6pm-9:30 pm US CST as our time slot.   


Session zero happening soon @ 7pm CST Today. (If you are interested and can't make it you can still feel free to apply)  


If you are interested please send a message with your age, gender, and experience level.

I was pleasantly surprised by this match. This was Makabe’s first title defense after dethroning Shinsuke Nakamura and he was up against NOAH stalwart Go Shiozaki. Makabe and Shiozaki had excellent chemistry, working a bruising, hard-hitting contest for the richest prize in the business.

Crypto enthusiasts keep funding convoy protests as traditional banks take action against it,"Vancouver entrepreneur Jeff Booth said he does not like being called an “organizer” for the funding going toward the self-described freedom convoy protests. And he insists he’s not a “facilitator” either.

But Mr. Booth said he helped create a Bitcoin wallet that has helped channel donations toward those demonstrations. More than $500,000 has been raised through the wallet so far.

In a wide-ranging interview, Mr. Booth said he believes in freedom of speech and his entire family is double-vaccinated against COVID-19. He also “understands both points of view” about pandemic restrictions across Canada, which he believes were “right at first.” And he said he’s not a COVID-19 denier.

“I’m a keyholder for this – that’s it,” he said. “I haven’t raised a dollar. I haven’t donated a dollar of my own and I’m not an organizer. I am just a keyholder in a decentralized platform … I could be replaced by anyone tomorrow. Tomorrow, there could be 10 people.”

After the U.S. crowdfunding platform GoFundMe broke ties with demonstrators last week, the fundraising effort started using other channels. One was the self-described “#1 Free Christian Crowdfunding Site” GiveSendGo, which had raised more than US$8,877,000, as of Friday.

On Thursday, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granted a request from the provincial government to freeze access to GiveSendGo, under Section 490.8 of the Criminal Code, prohibiting anyone from distributing donations made through the “Freedom Convoy 2022″ and “Adopt-a-Trucker” online campaigns.

This has not been the case for cryptocurrency transfers or donations, which bypass traditional channels and don’t rely on banks or government systems to distribute money.

On Friday, Toronto-Dominion Bank confirmed it had frozen accounts holding nearly $1.4-million donated to protesters who helped organize blockades, and said it is asking an Ontario court to take control of the funds.

TD is applying to the Ontario Superior Court to accept money raised through crowdfunding platforms and held in personal accounts at the bank. The bank will file an interpleader application that, if granted, would allow the court to accept the funds and decide how to disburse or return them to donors.

The bank’s decision to cut off access to the money comes after GoFundMe stopped releasing donations to protest organizers. More recently, the Ontario government successfully petitioned a court to freeze access to millions of dollars donated through GiveSendGo. Since then, donors have turned to alternatives such as cryptocurrency.

“TD has asked the court to accept the funds, which were raised through crowdfunding and deposited into personal accounts at TD, so they may be managed and distributed in accordance with the intentions of the donors, and/or to be returned to the donors who have requested refunds but whose entitlement to a refund cannot be determined by TD,” said Carla Hindman, a spokesperson for the bank, in an e-mailed statement.

Last month, as a convoy of trucks converged in Ottawa, GoFundMe temporarily froze about $1-million in funds donated by supporters of the blockade. But it then released that money after an organizer of the fundraising effort presented a plan to distribute the funds.

That $1-million in initial donations was deposited in a personal account at TD, according to a source familiar with the matter. Nearly $400,000 raised separately through e-transfers was also deposited in another personal account at TD, the source said.

The Globe and Mail is not identifying the source because they are not authorized to discuss details of the accounts.

Donated funds are supposed to be held in business banking accounts opened for non-profit purposes, not in personal banking accounts, according to bank policies that led TD to freeze the funds.

On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters Canadian banks are monitoring financial activity related to funding the protests and taking action when necessary.

The protest organizers’ stated goal in raising donations was to reimburse members of the convoy of trucks for fuel, food and expenses, and to give any leftover funds to charities.

But with traditional fundraising channels cut off, Bitcoin backers such as Mr. Booth and other crypto enthusiasts demonstrate the stark differences between the two financial sectors – and how they are playing out with the protests.

A prominent figure in Canada’s technology sector, Mr. Booth was named “Person of the Year” by the British Columbia Technology Industry Association in 2015. He serves on the board of multiple tech businesses and organizations, including Terramera Inc. and CubicFarm Systems Corp. (He chairs both companies.)

Until earlier this week, Mr. Booth also sat on the board of the Richmond Hospital Foundation in British Columbia. But after an emergency meeting this week, he resigned from his duties with the hospital.

“While we very much appreciate Jeff’s past contributions to our board, his affiliation is incompatible with our mission of ensuring the highest possible standard of health care for the families in our community,” the foundation said in a statement to The Globe and Mail, without elaborating.

Mr. Booth said he called the foundation himself and asked to resign.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are distributed across networks of computers through a technology called blockchains, which provide each participant with a public and private key.

The public key works much like an e-mail address that is shareable, while the private key is a string of letters and numbers that must not be shared. This is because the private key is a virtual vault that holds a participant’s money, much like a bank would, but instead on a blockchain ledger, providing the ideal of anonymity.

Sending cryptocurrency to someone is not a difficult process when a wallet address is public. It is as easy as choosing the amount and deciding where it goes. There are multiple wallet apps available for this.

Mr. Booth is one such wallet holder. But he said he is not specifically asking anyone to donate to his wallet. “I am not on either side of this issue,” he said.

Since Jan. 28, protesters across Parliament Hill have forced businesses to close and halted traffic in Ottawa for days. Police have laid multiple charges. On Friday, Ontario’s provincial government declared a state of emergency.

Mr. Booth said he’s against protests that turn violent. “I hate that part about it. I am categorically against it,” he said. “But I am still on both sides here… I believe in freedom of speech and expression… I don’t agree with all of the people on one side or another.”

The College of Winterhold might not be as lame as first throught,"You may have noticed I had been inactive the last week, not posting anything. Well, there is a reason for my inaction. Last week I bought The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (both SE and AE), and I've been working on making my ultimate character. You remember I made a post here about my final character, yadda-yadda-yadda?

Well, that was before checking on the Creations included for free in the Anniversary Edition, and one in special forced me to rework my build completely: Goldbrand. Of all Daedric Princes, the one I always felt best resonating with me was Boethiah, with his/her ""actions are worthier than words"" mindset. Coming from one of the most corrupt countries in the world, I came to see that democracy is flawed if it's not exercised in a country which federative unities are not the least autonomous, especially if it's a big country, which is why I think the US did right.

Thing is, Boethiah is a very problemati Daedric Prince to build a chatacter around, because his/her Daedric Quest is capped TOO HIGH! However, with Goldbrand, that could change, and I really put all my passion in this build: a Dunmer who worships Boethiah - constantly making pilgrimage to the Raven Rock Temple, hates the Empire for abandoning Morrowind in the Oblivion Crisis, and comes from House Redoran.

While I was near the end of the Civil War questline (guess what side), when I was level 10, halfway to level 11, I finally decided to at least start the quest to get Goldbrand, already expecting the quest to be quite hard at that level, since they say the best level to get it is level 40, and so I was prepared to put it on hold and returning to it at a higher level.

All was going well, I made to the Sacellum of Beothiah, then Sivdur's Rest... Then I had to have access to the Arcaneum in the College of Winterhold... THAT Arcaneum in THAT College of Winterhold. The same college I was always unable to enter as a visitor, and which secret entrance is so sadistically steep I can only hope to use it having one or more words of the Whirlwind Sprint shout (which I lacked, having yet to meet the Greybeards).

So in the end I was forced to at lest start the first quest of the College of Winterhold, My pure warrior joined a SCHOOL OF MAGIC! At first I paid no mind to it, and with great spill of sweat, blood ant tears (well, maybe not tears), I finally managed to defeat Magarthi to get his skull, so I could finaly acquire Goldbrand. Thing is, that victory came at a very dour price - staining my warrior character with magic, not only by joining the College of Winterhold, but by using the healing spell to survive the fight against Magarthi.

So I decided to reboot my build using a Creation which quest wouldn't touch the College of Winterhold at all, and I was going to write a post about my aforementioned experience, but on that day I wasn't feeling well so I was unable to finish it, so I just discarded it, and good thing that happened, because I soon got tired of that character as well.

Thing is, of the hundred characters I created while originally playing Skyrim for PS3, characters built around the use of magic always felt the most complete to me, as many quests involve the college, so I decided to reboot my character yet again to roleplay a mage.

While planning my new build, I realized something simply mindblowing: the College of Winterhold might actually be the best faction in the game! I mean, sure, I'm well aware it was badly executed, as what kind of school makes a noob into its head after a single practice class, a single field trip, and a prolonged investigation?

However, if you really look past the problematic questline, you'll see that, of all playable factions, this is the best integrated to the story in gameplay, roleplay, and even the lore. Firstly, many quests take you there. Want to find the Elder Scroll to learn Dragonrend or to find Auriel's Bow (depending on what quest you do first)? Ask Urag. Want to find the Moth Priest to read Serana's Elder Scroll? Ask Urag. You found the book Forbiden Legend and now you want to investigate on the legendary Galdur Amulet? Well, you'll have to join the College to gain entry to Saarthal.

Secondly, in terms of roleplay, not only most quests of either the Main Quest, the Civil War and both DLCs deal with exploring ruins, be them Nordic or Dwarven, but the fact you can read the tablets scattered across the 7000 Steps despite the fact they are written in the Dragon alphabet, which means the Dovahkiin can read the dragon alphabet, at least representing Tamrielic, I believe that, despite appearing in the trailers and official artwork as a warrior, Bethesda clearly meant for the Dovahkiin to be at least marginally inclined to the arcane.

Also, the humungus ammount of NPCs related to the College. Unless any of them studied outside Skyrim, all court mages are guaranteed to have studied at the College of Winterhold (comfirmed in the case of Wuunferth the Unliving and Fallion. Then you have both Nelacar and Malyn Varen of the Black Star quest, the deranged Hamelyn in Honningbrew Meadery, Festus Krex of the Dark Brotherhood, and so on.

In the third place, the lore: the object around which the College of Winterhold's questline unravels is the very object that caused the first known man vs elf conflict (the Night of Tears followed by the Return): the Eye of Magnus. This was the conflict that started al subsequent conflicts of this nature.

The Atmorans' victory over the Snow Elves eventually inflamed the Nedes' hearts and encouraged them to do the same to their cruel Ayleid masters. Sometime between these two events and the fall of Yokuda there was also the war between the Yokudans and the Sinistral Elves. Tiber Septim (AKA Hjalti Early-Beard AKA Talos Stormcrown) utterly humiliated the Aldmeri Dominion by using the Numidium subjulgate them, and in the most recent history of Tamriel, the Thalmor are returning the favor by outlawing Talos worship and manipulated the start of the Civil War. The very fact the College of Winterhold's antagonist is a Thalmor drives the point home!

So,  my newest (and I hope final) Skyrim character is a Breton mage named Armand Traven, a direct or indirect descendant of Hannibal Traven (the Archmage in TES IV: Oblivion). After the rise of the College of Whispers, the Traven family moved to Leyawiin in the Blackwwo Region, and its many generations had attended the Colleger ever since. Though Armand himself followed suit, by the time he was nearing his twenty-fifth birthday he had enough of the College of Whispers' political-mindness, and so he left his native Cyrodiil for Skyrim, to join the politically-neutral College of Winterhold...",ElderScrolls,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/sqq5wx/the_college_of_winterhold_might_not_be_as_lame_as/,Skyrim,SneakySpider82,sqq5wx,/r/ElderScrolls/comments/sqq5wx/the_college_of_winterhold_might_not_be_as_lame_as/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/sqq5wx/the_college_of_winterhold_might_not_be_as_lame_as/,13,2022-02-12

"Dignitatis Humanae, it's not what you think it is;","Perhabs the biggest misconception since Vatican II is that religious freedom as defined in Vatican II is a rupture, and that false religions have rights, but it's not so. Look at what Dignitatis Humanae actually says: &gt;Religious freedom, in turn, which men demand as necessary to fulfill their duty to worship God, has to do with **immunity from coercion in civil society. Therefore it leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine** on the moral duty of men and societies toward the true religion and toward the one Church of Christ. &gt; &gt;\- Dignitatis Humanae "" in civil society. Therefore "" If it were talking about coercion in general, then that "" therefore it leaves untouched "" would be problematic to say the least. It speaks on civil societies. There are two orders, the civil order, and the order of religion. Matters of the civil order belong to the state, while matters of religion belong to the Church. To say that you cannot absolutely be coerced in matters of religion by anyone, is heretical. Dignitatis Humanae carefully says, immunity from coercion in civil society. Meaning, the state has no authority over religion whatsoever, unless it concerns just public order ( for example if someone tries to sacrifice another human, the state can shut them down). DH on the other hand, doesn't speak of the coercive authority of the Church. But the Church have coercive authority in the order of religion. In fact, only the Church has. Not the state, the Church. The declaration is not a statement about religious liberty in general but about a specifically civil liberty: religious liberty in relation to the state and other civil institutions. It does not oppose religious coercion in general, but coercion by the state. The state is forbidden to coerce in matters of religion, not because such coercion is illicit for any authority whatsoever, but because such coercion lies beyond the state’s authority. The 19th papacy clearly taught that the Church is as much a coercive authority as the state, with a like right to make laws and to enforce those laws by punishments, and this teaching has never been reversed. The coercive authority of the Church, and in particular her authority punitively to enforce obligations to Catholic faith and practice on the baptized, is still fundamental to modern canon law. See the current canon law in force: &gt;Can. 1311 **The Church has the innate and proper right to coerce** offending members of the Christian faithful with penal sanctions. &gt; &gt;Can. 1312 §2. : §2. The law can establish other expiatory penalties which deprive a member of the Christian faithful of **some spiritual** **or temporal good** and which are consistent with the supernatural purpose of the Church. But despite the papal teachings, even in the nineteenth century, well before Vatican II, the idea of the Church as a genuinely coercive authority was disappearing from general catholic consciousness and understanding. With rampant secularization, legitimate coercion was increasingly being associated only with state activity in the public sphere. Look at this infallible canon from the Council of Trent, which was in response to Erasmus' argument: &gt;CANON XIV.-**If any one saith**, that those who have been thus baptized when children, are, when they have grown up, to be asked **whether they will ratify what their sponsors promised in their names when they were baptized; and that, in case they answer that they will not, they are to be left to their own will; and are not to be** **compelled meanwhile to a Christian life by any other penalty**, save that they be excluded from the participation of the Eucharist, and of the other sacraments, until they repent; **let him be anathema**. &gt; &gt;\- Council of Trent, Session 7, Canon 14 The Church can coerce the baptized in matters of religion, and punish them for crimes such as heresy, schism, apostasy and other things with **both spiritual and temporal punishments**. Trent called on the secular authority to help the Church, and it is also within the 1917 Code of Canon Law: &gt;Can. 2198:""A **crime** which offends **only the law of the Church**, by its nature, **is prosecuted** only by ecclesiastical authority, **though at times**, where this authority judges it necessary or opportune, **by requiring the help of the secular arm**. &gt; &gt;\-1917 Code of Canon Law, Can. 2198 See, see. Pope Leo XIII teaches: &gt;40. Others oppose not the existence of the Church, nor indeed could they; **yet they despoil her of the nature and rights of a perfect society**, and **maintain that it does not belong to her** to **legislate**, to **judge**, or to **punish**, but only to exhort, to advise, and to rule her subjects in accordance with their own consent and will. **By such opinion they pervert the nature of this divine society**, and attenuate **and narrow its authority**, its office of teacher, and its whole efficiency; **and at the same time they aggrandize the power of the civil government to such extent as to subject the Church of God to the empire and sway of the State, like any voluntary association of citizens**. &gt; &gt;\- Libertas Then there's the famous Syllabus of Errors, written by Bl. Pope Pius IX, where he **condemned** the following **errors**: &gt;77. In the **present day it is no longer expedient** that the **Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship** &gt; &gt;78. Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that **persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship**. &gt; &gt;24. **The Church** **has not the power of using force**, **nor has she any temporal power, direct or indirect.** &gt; &gt;25. Besides the power **inherent** in the episcopate, **other temporal power has been attributed to it by the civil authority** granted either explicitly or tacitly, **which on that account is revocable by the civil authority** whenever it thinks fit &gt; &gt;27. The sacred ministers of the Church and the Roman pontiff are **to be** absolutely **excluded** from every charge and dominion **over** **temporal affairs**. &gt; &gt;\- Syllabus of Errors Remember, **these are** errors **condemned** and **rejected** by the late Holy Father. It can be heard that it was an error in the middle ages when heresy was suppressed or when the baptized were forced into fidelity. ( In my country for example, if you didn't go to Mass save for guarding the fire, you were whipped, under king St. Stephen I, in France blasphemers got their tongues yeeted out under king St. Louis IX. While ripping out a tongue might have been illicit, punishment in itself was not.) The fact is, that back then things were different. Throughout Christendom, countries were confessional catholic states with Catholicism as the state religion, the state subordinated to the Church as it ought to be. The state when heretics were suppressed, or when public worship of false religions, or proselytization of false religions were restricted, wasn't acting on it's own authority at all. The state was acting on the authority of the Church, on behalf of the Church, acting as her agent, her secular arm. In the time of Vatican II, most of the world was secularized, with Church and state separation becoming the norm. Therefore the Church declared that **the state**, since no longer acting on behalf of the Church as her secular arm, **has absolutely no authority in matters of religion**, **except where** ( As DH points out) **just public order is concerned**. Even though non christians are not within the direct jurisdiction of the Church(they're not baptized), public worship and proselytazation of false religions are in the **indirect** because proselytizing or public practise of false religion **is a matter in the order of religion**, and **it interferes with the mission of the Church, namely to spread the Gospel and lead people to God, unto salvation**. An example, if a non us citizen, let's say russian were trying to interfere in us elections, usa can kick them out. The Fourth Lateran Council which was an ecumenical council of the Church, **required** rulers to **expel heretics** from their territory **under pain of excommunication**, see **Fourth Lateran Council canon 3**) **Also canon 70** is interesting: &gt;Certain people **who have come voluntarily to the waters of sacred baptism**, as we learnt, do not wholly cast off the old person in order to put on the new more perfectly. For, in keeping remnants of their former rite, they upset the decorum of the christian religion by such a mixing. Since it is written, cursed is he who enters the land by two paths, and a garment that is woven from linen and wool together should not be put on, **we therefore decree that such people shall be wholly prevented by the prelates of churches from observing their old rite**, **so that those who freely offered themselves** to the christian religion **may be kept to its observance by a salutary and necessary coercion**. For it is a lesser evil not to know the Lord’s way than to go back on it after having known it.- Fourth Lateran Council, canon 70 Also, St. Thomas Aquinas writes a rather interesting thing in Summa Theologiae II:II 11:3. Also, those who helped expulsing heretics got the same indulgence as crusaders, so another proof it cannot be wrong: &gt;**Catholics who take the cross and gird themselves up for the expulsion of heretics shall enjoy the same indulgence**, and be strengthened by the same holy privilege, **as is granted to those who go to the aid of the holy Land**. Moreover, **we determine to subject to excommunication believers who receive, defend or support heretics**. **We strictly ordain** that **if any such person**, after he has been designated as excommunicated, refuses to render satisfaction within a year, then by the law itself he shall be branded as infamous and not be admitted to public offices or councils or to elect others to the same or to give testimony. ‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎‏‏‎­ &gt; &gt;Fourth Lateran Council **Obviously, the Church cannot coerce a non christian into belief and cannot force them to be baptized, they are not under her direct jurisdiction that comes with baptism, and a forced baptism is invalid anyway.** **They must choose baptism freely.** But that doesn't mean that when non christians interfere with the mission of the Church, hurting the religious good, that the Church cannot put a stop to it using her secular arm, or when the validly baptized goes astray and tries to leave the faith, they cannot be coerced into fidelity. Afterall, the Church is the sole coercive authority in the order of religion. **Also, having authority is one thing, and exercising authority is another.** For example, the Council of Toledo, and the Fourth Lateran Council, both forbade jews to hold public offices. Then there's the papal bull Cum Nimis Absurdum by Pope Paul IV. &gt;**§ 1.** Volentes in priemissis, quantum cum Deo possumus, salubriter providere, hac nostra perpetuo valitura constitutione sancimus quod de cetero perpetuis futuris temporibus, tam in Urbe quam in quibusvis aliis ipsius Romanae Ecclesia civitatibus, terris et locis, iudaei omnes in uno et eodem, ac si ille capax non fuerit, in duobus aut tribus vel tot quot satis sint, contiguis et ab habitationibus christianorum penitus seiunctis, per nos in Urbe et per magistratus nostros in aliis civitatibus, terris et locis praedictis designandis vicis, ad quos unicus tantum ingressus pateat, et quibus solum unicus exitus detur, omnino habitent. &gt; &gt;**§ 4.** Nutrices quoque seu ancillas aut alias utriusque sexus servientes christianos habere, vel eorum infantes per mulieres christianas lactari aut nutriri facere. &gt; &gt;**§ 7.** Seu cum ipsis christianis ludere aut comedere vel familiaritatem seu conversationem habere nullatenus praesumant. &gt; &gt;\- Cum nimis absurdum Does the Church have authority to do it ? Yes. Was it perfect use of authority and prudential ? Probably not, God will be the judge of that: &gt;""if a minor spiritual power err, it will be judged by a superior spiritual power; but if the highest power of all err, it can be judged only by God, and not by man, according to the testimony of the Apostle: ‘*The spiritual man judgeth of all things and he himself is judged by no man*‘ \[1 Cor 2:15\]. "" &gt; &gt;\- Unam Sanctam But this authority shouldn't come as a surprise, the Church is the coercive authority in religious matters. If non christians, by abusing of their public offices in such wise that it would impede and interfere with the mission of the Church, guess what? The Church can shut them down to preserve the religious good. Yet, Nostra Aetate, paragraph 5 writes that there can be no discrimination based on religion. Seems a contradiction right? Wrong. If we take it at that value, we would be compelled to give the most Precious Body and Blood of Christ to not only protestants, but also to atheists, and non christians, nay, even to satanists. Yet, clearly that's not the case, nor it could ever be the case. Discrimination based on religion is indeed wrong, **insofar** as it lacks judicial warrant. Should all public worship of false religions be restricted in a catholic country? Most likely not, though it would be expedient. Yet, even in Papal States, the jews were tolerated. Sometimes it's obviously necessary, such as when a false religion starts to rise and grow rapidly, snatching away both the christian faithful from the bosom of the Church, and pagans aswell, seducing them from finding the truth which subsists in the Church. Should all proselytization of false religions be restricted in a catholic country? Absolutely, that is incredibly dangerous to the multitude of souls. Like all authority, these can be abused also. Nobody is claiming that the Church was always using every authority in a perfect manner, but that does not in the slightest mean that she doesn't have the authority. That sentiment can be likened to that of Luther and indulgences, namely throwing the baby out with the bathwater. He had problems with indulgences, and so he rejected purgatory alltogether. But even in the modern world, I would say it is prudential, nay, necessary, should Christendom make a comeback, to shut down all protestant public worship and compel them to live proper catholic life. After all, they are within the direct jurisdiction of the Church, by virtue of their baptism. \---- If anyone tries to say Trent is not as clear cut as it looks like, I'd invite you to read this: [here](https://www.academia.edu/37861294/John_Finniss_Alternative_History_of_Trent) \------ Let's carefully examine Quanta Cura: &gt;From which totally false idea of social government they do not fear to foster that **erroneous opinion, most fatal** in its effects on the Catholic Church and the salvation of souls, called by Our Predecessor, Gregory XVI, **an “insanity,”2 viz., that “liberty of conscience and worship is each man’s personal right, which ought to be legally proclaimed and asserted in every rightly constituted society; and that a right resides in the citizens to an absolute liberty, which should be restrained by no authority whether ecclesiastical or civil, whereby they may be able openly and publicly to manifest and declare any of their ideas whatever, either by word of mouth, by the press, or in any other way.**”Amidst, therefore, such great perversity of depraved opinions, we, **well remembering our Apostolic Office, and very greatly solicitous for our most holy Religion, for sound doctrine and the salvation of souls which is intrusted to us by God**, and (solicitous also) for the welfare of human society itself, have thought it right again to raise up our Apostolic voice. **Therefore, by our Apostolic authority, we reprobate, proscribe, and condemn all the singular and evil opinions and doctrines severally mentioned in this letter, and will and command that they be thoroughly held by all children of the Catholic Church as reprobated, proscribed and condemned.** &gt; &gt;\- Quanta Cura There we go, we have an infallible ex cathedra proclamation lest anyone calls into question the magisterial weight. It is also clear, that Trent implores the extraordinary conciliar magisterium ( canon-anathema), likewise with Fourth Lateran (canons). One could also build the case for ordinary and universal magisterium based on sensus fidei fidelium. So we can see that magisterial weight is not a problem, it is rock solid. To top it off, it is clearly, obviously, objectively wrong, to use any other interpretation, than that was used by the Council. ( Which by the way, even Pope Francis stated recently: &gt;"" Either you are with the church and therefore you follow the council, or if you do not follow the council **or you interpret it in your own way**, as you wish, **you are not with the church**. "" ) The official interpretation relationes, given to the council fathers by the drafting commission, are clear. For what other can be the interpretation of the Church, than the official interpretation documents by which the council fathers interpreted, and based on that, voted for the declaration? &gt;The **liberty or immunity from coercion which the declaration addresses** **does not have to do** with the relation of **man to the truth or to God,** **nor does it have to do with** relations **between the faithful and authorities within the Church**: **it really has to do with** relations between **people in human and civil society**, that is relations of **people with other individuals, with social groups** and **with the civil power.** &gt; &gt;\- Vatican II Acta Synodalia 4.5 p99 **There is no discontinuity** between Dignitatis Humanae and pre-vatican II doctrine. Dignitatis Humanae is the last great impact of the teachings of Pope Leo XIII. Dignitatis Humanae is **perfectly harmonious** with pre-Vatican II teachings of the Church. **The gates of hell did not, does not, and will never, ever prevail against the Church.** Long reads, more detailed explanations with more sources and official relationes [here](https://www.academia.edu/19136187/Pink_Rhonheimer_debate_at_Notre_Dame_on_the_interpretation_of_Dignitatis_Humanae_opening_address), and [here](https://www.academia.edu/32742609/Dignitatis_Humanae_continuity_after_Leo_XIII) and a video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMGxF9DuhHA) TL;DR: * The state cannot coerce you in religious matters * The Catholic Church can coerce you in religious matters * Doctrine didn't change, societies did * There is no rupture, there is continuity * You have a right to freely choose Catholicism rooted in your human dignity * Error has no rights * Water is wet",Catholicism,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/sqlab2/dignitatis_humanae_its_not_what_you_think_it_is/,,TheWardenatnothing,sqlab2,/r/Catholicism/comments/sqlab2/dignitatis_humanae_its_not_what_you_think_it_is/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/sqlab2/dignitatis_humanae_its_not_what_you_think_it_is/,5,2022-02-12

Nature took a wrong turn and called it Human.,"""And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.""

Opinion: This sentence alone is responsible for 99% of Human suffering. 

The unconscious, religious permeation of the idea that mankind faces a unique or elevated destiny compared to his fellow earthly organisms is the root of all worldly pain. 

Similar sentiments can be found within all Eastern, Judaic, and Islamic religions as well. Even Buddhism oozes this venom with its glowing carrot/stick of enlightenment. Religion, riding on the back of human hubris, has given rise to all the cultures we find ourselves nestled inside right now. Communities which guard us from the existential weight of our inherent loneliness. Nothing escapes these vortexes of anti-lucidity. They resemble human beehives, producing an ethereal honey called ""progress"". They are products of the mind of man, which is ironically only a memory, passed down from father to son, mother to daughter, teacher to student, master to slave. They demand to touch everything, to *know* everything, about this world and the imagined next.

I can't help but laugh every time a evolutionary biologist says ""anything an organism *needs* to know about the past is written into its genetics"". When did mankind secretly elevate itself beyond the category of natural organism? Why should we need to know anything about the past other than what we inherit from our DNA sequence?   

Instead of settling into our bodies as natural organism, humans tend toward heady mass hallucination produced by the overactive beehive brain, a domestic escape from the poverty of Being. But an earthly utopia is not a *replacement* for a God in heaven, it's the *same* thing. Scientific pursuit for the Truth of the origins of the universe is a copywritten mimicry of the age old search for God. It's a psychological pivot. A fools errand relocated and modernized.  

This is all to say that our values come from somewhere else, and ""secular"" or not, all religious belief leads to violence. How can it not? Religion, science, medicine, philosophy... all of these suggest a problem with the way things are, with existence itself, and problems need solving. Man has made a problem out of life. 

 We are sometimes called the animal who thinks, or a problem solving animal. Ask yourself this, did a problem ever arise that didn't originate with human thought? In other words, are problems something inherent to life or do they exist only in relationship with man? Did a problematic relationship with the universe even exist before homo sapiens were endowed with self awareness?

Buddhism does deserve a pat on the back for its astute observations about the state of human existence, namely suffering, *and* for its recognition of there existing no conceptual self within the body. This ""ghost in the machine"" fuels the egoic trip of human activity to no end. All of this activity for what? To solve the problems of life? Why bother? This is where Buddhism's dominating interpretation loses footing. It thinks it can offer a way out, while simultaneously insisting that there is nobody to escape and nothing to escape from. It tells us to follow it to the secret escape hatch in the basement of existence, and then only *after* we walk through its silent doors do we understand the consequences; *that the other side of the secret door was nothingness, also known as death!*

 There is only *one* way out, we call it dying. Hinduism calls it nirvana, but sells it as a state of consciousness attainable by the living. It's not. Only by returning to a soulless state, the *natural state,* can a person taste moksha, liberation. This means a complete divorce from the fiction of freewill. 

To realize that there is no ghost in the machine is equivalent to dying, minus the rigor mortis. Not psychologically or metaphorically, but *literally*. Fortunately for us, we don't even have the choice to choose this fate, and yet it is our destiny! 

This is the problem, the paradox. We all want eternal happiness, but we also want to know we are experiencing this eternal happiness. This isn't possible. Blissfulness is reserved for the dead. To die is to be absent from experience. To insist that you are alive and that life should be good is the turbulence that keeps you unhappy. To insist that the human race is destined for great things and is heading toward a bright future is the turbulence that creates war within societies and between cultures.

We walk side by side with ants and mice.

Beasts at the Gate (M4F),"For nearly one hundred years the southern gates have held, the ultimate barrier of stone and magic seperating the Northern Provinces, from the Southern Wastes. The wall and it's defenders have fought back the beastial hordes again and again, the tide of mutant creatures and horrifying nightmares kept at bay... until now.

The Gates have fallen, the defenders devoured or worse. The lands that have not known war in two generations have grown complacent. They are unprepared, unaware, and horribly ripe in the eyes of the beastmen now flooding northward. They have come to claim dominion over those who stand before them, to rule as brutal lords over their northern neighbors... Or at least pillage the countryside and breed their way through every female they come across.

Yes, it's fairly generic, but I'm a fan of the classics. Cliches exist for a reason, and this one is one my favorites. We have a plethora of beastmen to choose from, and any number of unfortunate young women who fall into their clutches. 

Looking for a focus on breeding/impreg, they're beastmen afterall, their number one instinct is to get the next generation going. I'm fairly open on kinks, just the ""normal"" limits most of us have: scat, snuff, futa, (sexual) gore, m/m. The usual.
I'm very open to suggestions, and ideas, and have no problem going short term or long term. Wanna get crazy? Let's get crazy, I'll at least consider most plots or scenarios. On the off chance someone wants to play a monstergirl, I am very much open to that as well.

Hope to hear from some of you soon.

My best comment to date about creationism,"I answered the question “are you a young earth creationist” with the answer of “maybe the earth is young, maybe old, but I am a creationist for sure.” And this explanation. 

The problem YEC have is exegetical. Genesis can be read quite literally to come up with about 6,000 - 10,000 years (as there seem to be some gaps in genealogies within the Bible). But it can’t be held as the only interpretation. 3 days and plants are around before there is even a sun to be a “sign in the heavens to mark... days...” in v 14. If there are 3 days before there is even a sign in the sky to mark the length of a day, how can we know days 1-3 are 24 hrs?

On the other hand, the problem with secular science is the science. The problems are numerous. Both in astronomy/cosmology and in geology. Also in evolution and determining how a conscience comes about, and how humans became who we are with a universal desire for purpose and justice. A good study of history from even a secular source (like Tom Holland’s book DOMINION) correctly puts evolutionary psychology into the “pseudoscience” category.

Cosmologically/astronomically, the horizon problem is just as big a problem as distant starlight for the YEC. Also, dark matter and dark energy seem ad hoc and untestable. Further problems include not having very much observation to support views for stellar evolution or planetary formation. It’s all models with circumstantial evidence, extrapolation, and mystery.

Radiometric dating assumes that we know the initial conditions of the rock concerning parent and daughter isotopes. Also that no contamination has happened. Isochrons were developed to help mitigate for these unknowns but didn’t factor in differential diffusion rates of the isotopes. (See: Robert Hayes from NC State 2017). That’s the only method that gets close to billions of years.

The problems with evolution are also preached by many (but not all) OEC and are popular enough to suffice as proper doubt for that theory. TOE doesn’t attempt to explain abiogenesis which furthers the problems for seculars to produce a convincing world view. Finally, there are long standing philosophical arguments for the existence of not only a Creator but one who is personal and concerned with our morals (specifically the cosmological, axiological, teleological, ontological, and transcendental arguments) that have yet to be refuted.

Add to those philosophical arguments the convincing lifestyles of the apostles of Jesus and the history surrounding the claim of the resurrection.... and then the seeming existence of miracles even today (see Craig S Keener)...

We can quite intellectually doubt the worldview of secular materialism being correct. The discussion for truth becomes theological, in my (well informed) opinion.

Either that or admit nothing matters. Admit that it is ok to go around believing whatever and even doing whatever because there is no God and therefore no reason to be right (either concerning reality or morality). The only thing that matters is pragmatism. YEC is perfectly valid pragmatically because most YEC fit into all aspects of society, except for debates over the age of the earth, quite well. The only reason to debate YEC is thus entertainment. Unless there is a God.

If there is a God, it’s best to be agnostic about the age of the earth. No need to assert 10,000 years. No need to assert secular science as conclusive. (Consensus means nothing). So no need to be OEC either. Creationism is enough.

Like I said, that or pragmatism. Or even nihilism. But pragmatism is much  more practical. Creationism is by far best once all disciplines are considered.

Ukraine: Proxy in More Ways than One (Part 2 of 5),"# Crimea &amp; The Black Sea

Crimea is also east of the Dnieper and, depending upon one's information sources, either a [plurality](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/) or a [majority](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2020-04-03/russia-love) of Crimeans want to be part of the Russian federation. However, Crimea's history is a bit more complicated. From the 10th to the 19th century it was predominantly [Tatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Tatars), and from then until the height of Stalinist Russia they were ethnically cleansed from the region. So, there's a case to be made that it's not really Russian or Ukrainian but then we're left with a bit of a historical loose end because [most of its current inhabitants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Crimea#Ethnicities_and_languages) are in fact Russian and Ukrainian; 1.45 million (60.4%) and 577,000 (24.0%), respectively. Are we to expel them and give the land to Turkey? That seems not just absurd but dangerously so and thus completely infeasible.

Although ethno-historical claims to Crimea aren't as unambiguous as would be preferred, it's not all up in the air. Most of Crimea's history has been as an autonomous region under the protection of a neighbor. Here, we are in the fortunate position of being able to appeal to some very recent and well-documented history to help clear up some details. First, one thing we can say with some degree of certainty is [it doesn't *really* belong to Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_transfer_of_Crimea#Motivation). And in keeping with Crimean history the [Crimean Declaration Of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_of_the_Republic_of_Crimea) asserts their sovereignty and right to form or sever association with other sovereigns, including the Russian federation. Although the official story in the West is that Russia ""[annexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation)"" Crimea - as in they invaded and stole it from Ukraine - that appears to me to be a narrative fiction meant to serve as a pretense for interventionism.

Taken all together, what do we have here? A majority Russian population in a historically autonomous region declaring its independence and its wish to ally with the Russian federation in accordance with their own sovereign interests. [Seems pretty straightforward to me.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination) And in case you didn't catch the point of that citation, don't overlook reference numbers [1](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_1514) and [3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations) in that article.

&gt;The right of a people to **self-determination** is a cardinal principle in modern international law (commonly regarded as a *jus cogens* rule), binding, as such, on the United Nations as authoritative interpretation of the Charter's norms. It states that peoples, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference.

Well, if it's that simple, why all the fuss? Infrastructure. Specifically, the port of Sevastopol. 

https://preview.redd.it/jymkatlxfch81.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05706fc772b70f1075220ea3d998c2f29035c90e

It is claimed that the conditions in the Black Sea are such that Sevastopol provides the best option for a winter portage of Russia's regional fleet but I'm not convinced by [the explanations I'm finding](http://www.ctv.by/node/42335) for why Russia hasn't finalized its move to Novorossiysk:

&gt;Every year from November to March, a squally wind called bora blows in the Novorossiysk region. It blows 40 days a year at a speed of 60 m/s, uprooting trees and breaking power lines. The temperature drops to 16 degrees below zero. The Novorossiysk bora brings huge damage to the coastal strip and causes icing of ships. Because of this, the bays become unnavigable in winter.  
\[...\] the Tsemess Bay is not the best place for the Russian Navy. According to experts, in the event of war in the winter months, the fleet will simply not leave the base in Novorossiysk. And in order to free the ships bound by ice, each time you have to use the help of icebreakers.  
\[...\] A feature of the Tsemes Bay can be called its shallow water. This disadvantage will not allow heavy ships to be based here. Indeed, for comfortable navigation, they need a port with a minimum depth of 30 meters. The Tsemess bay can offer only - 25. Moreover, the issue of deploying submarines in the bay is still being resolved. The whole problem is in the bottom, which is a layer of silt 8 meters thick. The sludge lifting procedure is an expensive operation. But the question is not about money, at the bottom of the bay for 65 years ammunition has been stored left over from the time of the Great Patriotic War.

Compare that with [Novorossiysk climate data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiysk#Climate) and the predictably limited public information on the port upgrades (berthing for [100 ships](https://vpk.name/en/569446_the-russian-military-has-upgraded-the-naval-base-in-novorossiysk.html), [7 submarines](https://www.globalsecurity.org/military///world/russia/novorossiysk.htm), and [a dive school](https://www.tellerreport.com/news/2021-01-26-%0A---%22modernization-in-almost-all-fleets%22--how-russian-naval-bases-are-being-updated%0A--.BJ79n8z6J_.html) at a cost of [$1.4 billion](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/355595), which were as far as I've been able to find all reportedly on schedule for their 2020 completion date) and it's curious why the Russian Black Sea Fleet remains in Sevastopol. The obvious reason is strategic but it's important to consider the indicative here; Is there [something NATO could do differently](https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08MOSCOW265_a.html) to disincentivize or deescalate?

# Donbas

Here, we begin to get into the matters which have been dominating the news lately. And it's yet another instance in which the heart of the issue is seldom discussed; I certainly spent many hours digging before I found the bottom: The region is the homeland of the [Don Cossack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossacks). In this conflict, ethnic Cossack freedom fighters are siding with Russia for liberation from ""[Kiev bandits](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27961934)"", blaming the Ukraine government for the deaths of thousands of their countrymen:

&gt;A deputy Cossack commander called Andrei draws my attention to an old map of Rostov region and eastern Ukraine up on the wall. It dates back more than a century.  
""This all used to be our land, the land of the Don Cossacks,"" Andrei tells me, pointing to Ukraine's Luhansk region. ""This is our common history, it's our people. That's why we're helping.""

They are only within Ukrainian borders because of, yet again, lines drawn by far-away politicians who have no real relationship with the people over whom they claim dominion. The suits and ties in Kiev and Brussels and DC aren't interested in the Cossacks; They are interested in the strategic value of the region as well as the [natural resources](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/12/11/ukr-d11.html) the Donbas holds. 

https://preview.redd.it/ypwr778zfch81.jpg?width=1180&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44aa5afad0360c77ac90bb11f89ae95a5d1475f3

Moving beyond the Don Cossack, [most people in the Donbas are Russophone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/UkraineNativeLanguagesCensus2001detailed-en.png/800px-UkraineNativeLanguagesCensus2001detailed-en.png) and ethnically Slavic Russian. Villagers even on the very front lines of the fighting [are indifferent](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/28/for-us-things-wouldnt-change-ukrainian-villagers-speak) to the war and to the nationalism they are meant to feel for Ukraine:

&gt;“I don’t think our situation would change,” says Sergei, a former teacher who has been unemployed since most of his students left in 2014 \[...\] Residents describe being cut off and forgotten by the rest of the country. “Support from the state has completely dried up,” said Ludmilla, a shop owner. “It has left us exhausted.” \[...\] Unemployed and living off fruit and vegetables they grow in their gardens, locals resort to stealing firewood in the winter from the surrounding forest to keep warm. “We are not scared of a change in authority,” said Natalya, a pensioner who lives by the riverbank. “Perhaps gas prices would be lower if the separatists came here.”

A strange thing to hear of people living in one of the most resource-rich regions of the world - Rather, it would be strange if it weren't by this point a tragic cliche.

Just like in Crimea, the people of the Donbas have [held referendums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Donbas_status_referendums) which assert their right to self-determination and [their desire to join the Russian federation](http://web.archive.org/web/20211009092602/https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-calls-for-civilized-implementation-of-east-ukraine-referendum-results-1399884791) but, unlike in Crimea, [Russia did not seize the opportunity](http://web.archive.org/web/20210814171215/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/world/europe/ukraine.html) to annex. Why? Obviously, there are geostrategic reasons for that decision. Do those reasons still hold today?

These are great headphones if you work from a bit of a noisy home or office and have put up with bad headsets long enough.

I am a busy dad who works in a home office. We have kids playing and yelling, practicing piano, running in and out of the house. After using the very lightweight and cool Plantronics Encore H101N for a decade, I decided I wanted something better for listen to music and edit audio and video while cutting down on the household background noise. These headphones have been perfect for that. It's also hand to flip up my mic to auto-mute it when my wife or kid come in to talk to me, they can also tell when it's up that it's safe to talk. It makes sneaking in lunch while listening to a boring conference call easier and safer - no more questioning whether my mute is on or not. I may go back and use my Plantronics during warmer weather, but fall, fall, and spring will find me wearing my GAME ZEROs.

I bought these and the GAME ONEs to compare them and ended up keeping these GAME ZEROs. I'll admit the GO open back headphones sound a bit better, especially with the the Dolby 7.1 enabled through the USB dongle, but that dongle is available for purchase seperately. Sound stage is on the GAME ONEs is amazing, but these are pretty good. I'm not a heavy gamer but I'm happy in these. If I was a fanatic and had a smaller head, I'd keep the GOs. My wife likes the GOs as they are cooler and she can hear what the kids are up to better than the isolation of the GAME ZEROs when shes working. My ears get a little warm in the GZs, but I just turn down the heat 2 degrees and I'm fine. Works great in winter. The mic is great for Skype or other voice calling, and I am on monsterously long VOIP calls - sometimes 6-8 hours. The GAME ZEROS are never uncomfortable even for that length of time. I recommend a small phone wind screen over the microphone to cut down on popping noises from splosives. I really appreciate a removable cable that enables me to listen to my iOS devices.. it works great. It's missing the 3-button control, but it does have a volume dial on the right ear cup and also the flip up mic mute. I can live with that. These are better than the GOs for larger dad-size heads, or if you just like super comfy cans. The GOs cause head pain after wearing for 1-2 hours. I do prefer the velour ear cup fabric over the hotter 'leather' of the GZ, but Sennheiser tech support explained the 'leather' is necessary for sound isolation. I agree with this. If you really want the velour cups you can order them seperately as they're interchangeable between models.. The auto-mute when you flip up the mic is perfect for long conference calls when you need to be sure the mic is off to talk to someone in the room with you or eat lunch. No more wondering if the mute is really on. The noise cancelling feature works fine, minimizing background sounds, but not eliminating them completely.

I bought these as the same time as the GAME ZEROs and decided to keep the them and return GAME ONEs for the following reasons:
1 - The GZs fold flat
2 - The GZs have removable cable, including a shorter IOS compatible cable
3 - The GZ ear cups are bigger. Yuge! They feel like Cadillacs on your head. Heavenly. The GZs are more comfortable overall, except for heat.
4 - Closed backs. Audio is actually better on the GO, but I can do with a little less spacial fidelity when I need to get work done or listen to a conference call while my daughter practices piano in the adjacent room.

I'm a busy dad who works remotely from home.
If you have a fully size manly head and can turn the heat down a little so your ears don't overhead and work in a busier home or office, go with the GAME ZEROs.

If you're wondering if $200 is too much for a good headset, wonder no more. It is. You deserve them. It's a small favor you deserve for being chained to a desk all day. The only other headset that is more comfortable is the Bose QC-25. That's mainly because they are lighter and have better digital audio processing. But they cost $100 more, require a batter to get the better sound, and frankly the Sennheiser mic is better due to its position, size, and noise cancelling design. If you want' super lightweight and need noise cancellation, get the Bose. If you can live with the slightly more weight, better mic, and sure muting, get the Sennheiser Game Zero.

 These are a hard pass for me...

I purchased these with high hopes but was horribly let down. Plugging in via on-board (both front case and main back) they sounded weak and tinny. Plugging in via my Sound Blaster Z, the powered boost helped in terms of volume, but the lack of substance / tinny undertone was now even more dominant.

Going even further, I plugged them into a GoXLR to utilize even more of a 'boost', still tinny. My XLR makes a $15 headset from Walmart sound amazing, it did no justice here. I even went as far as purchasing a USB adaptor in one last effort to know for sure that it wasn't a lack of power to the unit, it's just the quality of the speakers, still tinny / no substance.

The default leatherette ear pads are comfortable, but cheap feeling and I could tell that they would crumble over time because it's the 'thin' material that just flakes when they dry out OR get overused. Because of this, I did purchase Felt earpads (search for Genuine Sennheiser HZP 26 Replacement Ear Pads Cushions). They fit beautifully and made the unit more comfortable, this did not assist with the sound, if anything made it worse because your ear was no longer 'locked' into the leather, so they were swapped back to the original pads.

I'm not looking for headphones that will rattle my eardrums, by any means, but having absolutely no substance on any song listened to, or game played, just takes away from the overall experience, especially on the higher end of $150. An audiophile would absolutely hate these, and the sound issues (no matter having an EQ adjustment or flat) caused issues in-game where I didn't hear any footsteps for anything going on around me. In an FPS it's essential to know your surroundings, no settings anywhere on my PC allowed for this without having to full crank these to 100% on both the computer AND the headset. I wish I could give these less than a 1 star, but Amazon doesn't allow for it.

I've already started the return process on these, really unfortunate. I'll continue my search for something better.

I had originally bought the GAME ONE headset because I was listening to people talk about getting them for their better soundscape and other such mystical exhortations. They sold me on it and I bought them. Excellent headset, can't complain about them. I saw the GAME ZERO, the more expensive closed design brother to the GAME ONE, was on sale for a much better price than before. I thought to myself, do I need that headset. My impulse told me yes and now, after a transaction and one speedy delivery later, I have the headset sitting in front of me... The leather cups are nice and interchangeable for the foam cups of the GAME ONE. They do tend to get a little hotter around the ears, but no issue there for me really. They actually contain metal in the overall design and have the left and right cups marked (yes, I'm the guy that would accidentally put the headset on backwards). The microphone is as good in quality as the GAME ONE mic, so I was not disappointed. My dad and I now game together, him with my old GAME ONE and me with my new GAME ZERO, and we now rule as father and son of the Galaxy... (Disclaimer: Will not give you ultimate dominion of the Galaxy) 5 star for this badboy.

 Fantastic product.

I have 3 of these now in both black and white. The black has a matte finish, the white has a glossy finish. They're lightweight and have excellent audio.
You'll get headset hair after wearing them for a while.
I can wear these all day despite having glasses -- other headsets can push on the stems of your glasses into your skull and over time it can hurt; these don't do that.
The automatic mute when you put the boom up is a great touch.
The side volume thing is also amazingly useful.
They work great for talking on a cell phone too; just use the secondary wire.

I rarely find products that are truly remarkable in build quality. This is one such product. Expect it to last a long time.

[Edit: I just bought a 4th pair. I love these!]

Do you play with any house rules?,"I was curious how many play with house rules and if so what are they. I play with a few and I only play in true solo.

Heroes:

Dr. Strange draws an encounter card when he reshuffles his invocation deck. 

Hulk's Sub-orbital Leap ignores Crisis Icon when paid for with only physical resources. His Hulk Smash gains Piercing when paid only with physical resources. His Immovable Object now gives him Stalwart. 

Scenarios:

Risky Business- Threat can only be removed from the main scheme when State of Madness is faceup, meaning you can only remove threat when Goblin is out. 

The Once and Future Kang- His second phase defeats the player if his main scheme completes. Two copies of Kang's Dominion is added to the encounter deck.

Infiltrate the Museum- I let myself remove up to 2 cards from the collection in a round but I can only do each option once per round. So to remove 2 cards, I have to pay 2 resources and exhaust my hero.

Looking for one additional player for Campaign [5e] [Online] [Talespire] [Tuesdays],"&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone!

I'm a DM currently starting up my second weekly homebrew campaign looking for an additional player to fill our table. My first campaign is currently on hiatus for a few months while one of our players is away on paternity leave.

I have been using table top simulator to run these games for the most part, but have decided to try out Tale Spire for this time around to see how we like it; so it will be required to partake in the campaign.

The campaign itself is a town-building campaign set on an uncharted frontier. The party will explore the ancient wilderness in search for a newly discovered mineral in a bid to establish a supply chain back to one of three factions - all while managing the new land's first settlement. Face down the dangers of the wilds and navigate the murky politics of three sovereignties vying for dominion over this new world! (Full Campaign Synopsis Available on Our Discord).

Most Likely looking at Tuesdays 6pm-9:30 pm US CST as our time slot.

Session zero happening soon @ 7pm CST Today. (If you are interested and can't make it you can still feel free to apply)

If you are interested please send a message with your age, gender, and experience level.

Thanks for reading!",lfg,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/sr4k08/looking_for_one_additional_player_for_campaign_5e/,Player(s) wanted,Salarius17,sr4k08,/r/lfg/comments/sr4k08/looking_for_one_additional_player_for_campaign_5e/,https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/sr4k08/looking_for_one_additional_player_for_campaign_5e/,0,2022-02-12

I know the plot of the next Pokémon Legends Game!,"Or what it probably will be. It would makes sense, at least in my opinion. 😗

The game would open relatively the same with a gold/silver protag adjacent character waking up in a void, complete with, instead of a smart phone, a pokegear. 

Then suddenly a small green light will appear, and tell the protagonist that they must hurry, that a terrible calamity is about to occur and they must stop it before it's too late. Then suddenly the light will evelope them. It will grow brighter and brighter. Then the voice will shout HOLD ON! Before the screen goes black. 

The charater will then awaken on a rocky beach. After walking arround they will stumble upon a woman (who will probably just so happen to look exceptional familiar. I personally like the idea of her being based off of red, because that would open it up for a lot of refences and allusions). The woman will ask who you are and where you came from, then ask your name. She will introduce herself as Dr: something tree adjacent (I like Cherise. Or maybe Lilliac.) 

She will then inform you that you are in Goldenrod City, capital of the Shogedo region. (A pun on Edo, the region that both Kanto and Johto are based off of , and a refrence to the shoganate, which this time is roughly based off of.) Everything will look similar to ekruteak, though there will be a building called the Unova Syndicate, which will play a Sudo villain role throughout, not really the main villian, but refrenced as a menace, similar to the bandit sisters in Legends Arkoos. 

The dr will mention laventon, and his work cateloging the various pokemon of the region, and she will ask you to do the same. She will gift you one of three partner poekmon 

Personally I have a feeling the pokemon will be:

Squirtle, with a Shogedo Blastoise, that leans into a samurai feel way more than samurrot ever did.

Grookey, with Shogedo Rillaboom, which will use a massive Taiko instead of a modern drum kit.

Tepig, whose final evolution will be Shogedo emboar, a sumo wrestler!

You will receive a message on your poke gear, reminding you of the great calamity. When you ask the dr about it, she tells you that she has no idea what you're talking about. 

So now you have two missions:

1. Complete a catalog of all the pokemon that live in the Shegedo Region.

And 

2. Discover what this Great Calamity is.

So you get sent off to you journey. The region will be split up into several sections, lake of rage as a forest with a sea in the north half, blackthorn and the ice tunnel, mount silver as an active volcano (that will one day go dormant. The dr should appear and remark that it would make a fine tablau for a pokemon battle 😏) . The area South of goldenrod as a plains area with a couple rivers (with dark cave of course). The ruins of alph will make a return in another area, while ecruteak will function as a second base camp. Finally, Olivine and cianwood as the water area. A few locations will be re-named of course. The slowpoke well will be call Pinku Cave, Ilex forest will be called The Forest of Eyes, and the lake of Rage will be call Red Water Sea.

During your journey you will meet two clans, the gold clan and the silver clan. Both of these clans were once at war, but then Ho-oh descended from the heavens  and Lugia rose from the sea. Despite being wildly different the two managed to co exist peacefully. The clans were so moved by this that they agreed to set aside their differences and live in harmony.

But lately thing have grown tense again. 

A slew of thefts and assaults have got the clans at each other's throats again. Despite the calls from the leaders of both clans to keep the peace, it seems that war will be upon them once again. 

Over the course of the game, you the protagonist watch as things begin to spiral out of control. 

In the second act, you discover who is really behind the attacks on the clans.

It is a mysterious order of ninja's, living out of the forests surrounding the red water sea, calling themselves the Rocket clan. The Unova Syndicate has promised them dominion over all of the Shogedo region so long as they don't interfere in Unovas plans to colonise their neighbours to the south (which is implied to be Hoenn). So their Leader, an ancestor of both silver and Giovanni, is going to land the final blow. Using their Raichu, they use a thunder to strike the bronze tower, which Lugia is perched atop, and starts the fire that is so infamous in Pokemon lore. Lugia lives, but is gravely wounded. The silver clan finally declare war of the gold clan for daring to hurt Lugia and destroying their sacred temple, while the gold clan declare war right back for silver daring to claim that gold had anything to do with the fire. Especially after their leader helped Ho-oh revive the sacred pokemon within!  

In the third act the player must choose who to side with, the gold clan (which means you'll partner with ho-oh against the silver leader, who uses Lugia) or the silver clan ( partner Lugia vs gold leader with Ho-oh) 

Of course by the end, the player will reveal the Rocket clan and the Unova Syndicate as the real culprates behind this mess, causing the clans to come together once again to oust them both. 

And roll credits.

The player's next mission is to solve the mystery of the alph ruins, which were sealed upon your first exploration of the area, and suddenly open in the post game.

 You'll find the legendary Pokemon Mew asleep inside. Unbeknowst to you, the leader of the rocket clan, whose still pretty miffed at you for spoiler their plans, has followed it. When you discover new the leader will make an exclamation of amazement. It will immediately run away, and the rocket leader will proclaim it their solemn mission to capture that pokemon someday. Then they dissappear. The professor will appear, make some rather poingniant remark about the dangers of letting science run amok and the greed of humans. Then she will tell you about strange readings coming from the forest of Eyes. 

When you arrive you'll receive a few other quests from Kurt's ancestor, the shrine maiden of the Forest of Eyes. Once you complete them you will meet the name sake of the game, and the one who sent you to stop the great calamity, Celebi. Who will joyously thank you for saving the region from the Unova Syndicate and the Rocket Clan. It will apologize for dropping you on the beach outside golden rod. It had meant to take you straight to the shrine maiden, who could have explained more, but lost its grip about half way there. Then the game will end with a short cutscene of you returning to your own time. 

Then of course you'll wake back up in your bed in goldenrod, so you can keep doing whatever you'd like in the Shogedo region, catching shinies, riding on the red gyrados, catching all the unknown... Excetera...

At least that seems the most plausible 😉

Not sure it'll go exactly like that.

But it would be a pretty fricken cool game if it did!

Feel free to add anything else you'd like to see or think would happen!

Are you depressed? Lonely? Stuck with a frown that just won't turn upside down? Then the Smiling Friends are for you! They're a team of hardworking characters who will stop at nothing to see a grin on your face, dedicated to spreading joy across the world and makin' people smile. Well, at least Charlie and Pim. The rest don't really seem to do anything.

**Physical Resources**

* [**[Building]** The company is based in a giant, spherical building designed to look like a smiley face.

  * [**[Building]** The walls of the building are surprisingly spacious. There's a squatter who lives there, who really wants you to respect his privacy.](https://v.redd.it/vq4h1tlxaeh81 ""S1E1"")

  * [**[Building]** The Boss has a special thinking room above his office, with a window out of one of the pupils and a gun on the wall.](https://v.redd.it/42vgzh4yafh81 ""S1E7"")

**Finances and Influence**

* [**[???]** According to the Boss, the company is (or at least was) valued in the billions. He also has a crack financial advice team of Warren Buffet, Ronald Reagan, and Mr. Peanut available to him. But he's kind of maybe having a psychotic episode here, so... who knows if this is real.](https://v.redd.it/wepw2u4vafh81 ""S1E7"")

* [**[Strength / Durability Limit]** Chops down a tree with an axe. (Alan just randomly had it when they left from the office, so I guess it's a communal office axe?) However, the tree falls down and squishes him. Maybe it was a really heavy tree.](https://v.redd.it/rdylkmsl8hh81 ""S1E8"")

#[Pim](https://imgur.com/a/rJ0S9oK)

&gt; ""This is gonna be great, Charlie! I love helping kids. I love kids, Charlie. I LOVE KIDS!!!""

The other Smiling Friend that actually does anything. Pim dreams of getting married and having a family someday, but for now is trapped in the life of a bachelor. Not that he lets that get him down. His childlike eagerness to help people in need is only matched by his inability to bring in results.

* [**[Limitation]** In one episode Pim is established to have bad eyesight, where he mistakes a bowl of worms for a bowl of peanuts and starts eating them](https://v.redd.it/q03vvea0oeh81 ""S1E3""), [and in another part where he mistakes the address 158 Meep Boulevard](https://v.redd.it/txpwpmx0oeh81 ""S1E3""), [for 153 Meep Boulevard](https://v.redd.it/wjjdbpr1oeh81 ""S1E3""); [he does however say he's going to go visit the optometrist at the end of the episode. Maybe he got contacts or something?](https://v.redd.it/cvv46vy3oeh81 ""S1E3"")

#[Alan](https://imgur.com/a/612lSRI)

&gt; ""I just wanted my cheeeeese!!!""

Neurotic and obsessive, Alan doesn't really get much screen time, but when he does, his bizarre personality is often overpowered by the strange scenarios he finds himself in. He seems to enjoy small pieces of cheese and has a stash of paperclips.

**Physicals**

* [**[Strength]** Pushes a fridge.](https://v.redd.it/lkjxmg3vaeh81 ""S1E1"")

After Desmond takes care of the Bliblies, he's shown to be just fine.](https://v.redd.it/9hh2wpeoeeh81 ""S1E1"")

#[Glep](https://imgur.com/a/d36nyo8)

&gt; *gibberish*

Glep is a small green creature who mostly hangs out on a beanbag. His job around the office is unknown. He once skipped work and tried to make it big as an actor, but that's about it.

**Physicals**

* [**[Strength]** Hurts Charlie with a kick to the shin.](https://v.redd.it/tsc6vfxtafh81 ""S1E7"")

* [**[Skill]** Speaks a sort of gibberish language that other characters (such as Alan) seem to understand](https://v.redd.it/844gpgutaeh81 ""S1E1""); [in the first season finale, which is framed as Glep telling a story to his grandchild in the future](https://v.redd.it/d3z4daan8hh81 ""S1E8""), [it's revealed he can speak English perfectly fine, or at least learned how. Also, if the picture on the mantel is any indication, he apparently became President at some point.](https://v.redd.it/ixg5hzjm8hh81 ""S1E8"")

#[The Boss](https://imgur.com/a/lAzePj5)

&gt; ""Boys, I just got a call from a young man who sounded absolutely distressed. Can you head over and help him before he goes - Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!""

Everyone's favorite character. The Boss isn't just the founder and owner of the Smiling Friends corporation, he's also a [proud father](https://v.redd.it/6eylvy6f9eh81 ""S1E1""), a [deeply dedicated gamer.](https://v.redd.it/mujcqfctafh81 ""S1E7""), and even a [gifted poet.](https://v.redd.it/3x7p6q6o8hh81 ""S1E8"") He can be a bit eccentric though.

**Other**

* [**[Gear]** Keeps a machine gun in his thinking room](https://v.redd.it/k6wrvujuafh81 ""S1E7""); [he was prepared to kill Grim with it.](https://v.redd.it/7cai4q2xafh81 ""S1E7"")

#[Smormu](https://imgur.com/a/ADSuZh7)

&gt; ""Don't worry Pim, I can cheer you up!""

Across the vast pantheons of pop culture, there are few characters that can truly claim iconic status. Smormu is one of them. Clad in a miscolored I'm With Her tee shirt, Smormu was democratically elected as the fifth Smiling Friend (apparently the Boss isn't included in that count).

* [**[Fame / Talent]** In a nationwide text poll](https://v.redd.it/zmhyi6x4oeh81 ""S1E3""), [Smormu was voted in as the fifth Smiling Friend. Somehow he won, despite losing the Electoral College. He can dance and sing his famous theme song.](https://v.redd.it/57hvo4p5oeh81 ""S1E3"")

* [**[RIP]** Revealed after the credits, Smormu apparently died sometime after his first appearance on the show.](https://v.redd.it/xakvtzn6oeh81 ""S1E3"")

I never even knew he was sick. Rest his poor soul.

This girl I like and am considering dating is going to watch dominion this week and I’m nervous she won’t go vegan after,"We both like each other and one of the things holding us back from dating is that I’m not sure I wanna date an Omni. She claims to love animals but eats them and I point out the hypocrisy in that, but she won’t go vegan for some complicated reasons. But despite them I feel like if she doesn’t go vegan after watching dominion I’ll have no respect for her and all my feelings will be gone. Which is fine, but we’re also really close friends and I’m afraid if she doesn’t go vegan after I’ll lose all her as a friend too.

Today's Top #2: TD Bank freezes accounts that received money for Canada protests (it’s much much worse than just GoFundMe),"tldr; Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) has frozen two personal bank accounts into which $1.1 million had been deposited to support protesters fighting the Canadian government's pandemic measures. The bank applied to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on Friday to take the funds, which were sent through GoFundMe and bank transfers, so they can either be sent to the intended recipients or returned to donors.

[F4F] Long-Term Roleplay Partner Search (Ideas and Introduction inside - Serious Inquiries Only!),"Hello everyone! Thank you for taking the time to read this roleplaying ad! I have quite a few ideas below for you, but I would love to hear any of your ideas too!

  
My name is Rey. I’m 26 years old (turning 27 very soon). I use she/her pronouns. I would consider myself an advanced literate roleplayer/writer, but I know that using those labels can sometimes be limiting or intimidating so don’t let that scare you off. I enjoy vibing with my partners, getting to know them through OOC, sharing pictures/art/videos that remind me of our characters or story so prepare yourself for that. It would be ideal if my partner returned the same energy! I am very understanding of work schedules and having this occur in your personal life, I would just like to be notified if you will be offline for a period of time or if you are experiencing a dry spell. I will not get disappointed or upset if you communicate properly with me. I’m very understanding and easy-going, so please keep an open channel of communication with me and we will be all good to go! :-)

  
I have been roleplaying for well over a decade now. I feel like I am a bit snobby when it comes to character references. By snobby, I mean that I will literally spend hours sometimes looking for the RIGHT picture to use for my character because I appreciate using good art. I would also like my partner to be accepting of me not using real photos, it takes me out of the fantasy aspect that roleplaying gives me. That being said, I always use high-quality illustrated photos that - yes - can sometimes be anime-adjacent, but I hope that doesn’t scare you off. I am a bit of a perfectionist, so I will often build mini-profiles for my characters along with dozens of other reference photos to use at later times.

  
I’m also a huge fan of using Google Docs because I can use colors, different fonts, headers, images, and so much more. If you are someone who isn’t very comfortable using Google Docs, that’s OK. If you are someone who prefers staying within Discord, that is also OK - just let me know in your message! :-)  
When you reach out to me, you can use PM or the chat feature! I would like to know your name, your pronouns, how long you’ve been roleplaying, some of your likes/hobbies, and some pet peeves you have about roleplaying that way I try to avoid conflict with you! :-)

  
In regards to ideas, phew. I have quite a few, but I will do my best to just try and summarize them.  
  
The first idea is built within a world that I created called Solluna. There are three main nations; Kingdom of Eliacion (Humans who are wary of magic and non-humans), Hethryian Empire (Elves, scholars, and beastfolk live in peace here amongst nature), and Ofealan Dominion (tiefling-adjacent beings who are feared for their skills on the battlefield and unique way of life). I would love to be the game master to your character making their way through my world. Or playing out the life of one of the royals. Or being a monster hunter who’s trying to make a name for themselves. The list goes on and on. It’s quite a lively world and I would love to share a map with you if you are interested in playing in this world.  
  
The second idea I have is built within another world that I created that doesn’t really have a name yet, but it’s a world based on Ancient Japan/Feudalism and ninjas. I would like to explore the world with you, develop characters, create political intrigue, conflicts between nations, and more! Something interesting about this story is that I would like the women (kunoichi) of the nations to be the stronger of the two genders (non-binary characters and partners welcome! I know that sounds a bit exclusionary, so I apologize). There are four main houses; Furukoshi (which covers most of the western side of the map with a strong naval hold on the world - their elemental strength is water/ice), Mudanqiu (covers the northeastern side of the man with their elemental strength focusing on fire), Kimotari (an isolated island in the north who specialize in air techniques), and Guihua (the central nation who focuses on earth/grass elements). There is a mysterious unexplored portion of the land to the south as well. This world has taken inspiration from Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Demon Slayer. I would like to develop the magic system of this world with you, build unique and strong characters that are capable of battling against one another along with whatever monsters/demons may appear.  
  
The third idea I have is inspired by Howl’s Moving Castle. A hidden-in-plain-sight sort of place known as the Safe Haven. It acts as a halfway house for spirits, ghosts, demons, celestial creatures, etc. as they move from the mortal realm to the immortal realm, they can rest their weary bones (or incorporeal forms, you get what I mean, right?!). It’s run by a mortal family that had entered into an agreement with a deity of sorts several centuries ago. I would like to focus on the family dynamics along with some romance and drama. I originally thought that this would work best in a modern setting (similar to Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid, if you’re familiar with this anime), but I think it would be interesting if the family were somewhat outsiders in an earlier time period (my mind always goes to ancient Asia, sorry). A bit more light-hearted in the sense that the family deals with drunk and lazy spirits who sometimes trash their rooms available for rent, but I would love to also incorporate something darker along the lines of a villain destined on breaking their agreement - turning the immortal beings against the mortals for some reason that we can develop together.  
  
The fourth idea is based on the sports anime Free! I love sports teams and would love to craft a rivals-to-lovers dynamic with you based on a sport that we decide on if you choose this idea.  
  
Those are just the ones that I’m willing to put into cohesive thoughts. I have plenty more if you don’t like any of those, but I hope I gave a proper image of who I am as a writer! I enjoy romance, drama, dark themes, and complicated love triangles (squares, pentagons, and more!). I prefer f/f pairings, but am open to m/f, m/m, and anything with non-binary and transfolk!  
  
Like I stated earlier, feel free to reach out to me, tell me more about yourself, and we can move over to Discord as soon as I feel that we are a good match.   
  
Thanks for taking the time to read this! I hope you have an amazing week!",dirtypenpals,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/srs0gi/f4f_longterm_roleplay_partner_search_ideas_and/,Long Term RP,NaoriSoSoSo,srs0gi,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/srs0gi/f4f_longterm_roleplay_partner_search_ideas_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/srs0gi/f4f_longterm_roleplay_partner_search_ideas_and/,6,2022-02-13

**Forestcraft**

In the great woods of Forestcraft, where the elves reside in small villages dotted all across the mighty woods. We find Liza wondering where Kokkoro went off to. Selwyn pointing out that the Princess Connect Anime has a second season, so she's obviously busy with that. Liza is a bit sad since not a lot of the other leaders are around her size besides Kokkoro.

For Forestcraft Ladica Forest continues to hold dominion, followed by Sekka Forest and a bit of Annihilation Forest.

Forestcraft continues to be one of the strongest classes in the game with strong presence at tournaments and solid on ladder as well. The fairy engine continues to be a powerful core for it that really makes it difficult to compete with. Toss in powerful finishers in Ladica and Sekka and it's quite clear why Forest is one of the best at the moment. I'd not expect it to change until the next expansion short of a surprise set of balance changes.

**[Ladica Forest](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.1.76QHo.7AJJS.7AJJS.7AJJS.7Hv9C.7Hv9C.7Hv9C.7Hvtw.7Hvtw.7Hvtw.7Lhag.7Hsj6.7Hsj6.7Hsj6.7LlkI.7LlkI.7LlkI.7AEw2.7AEw2.7AEw2.7AB_0.7AB_0.7AB_0.7AJJI.7AJJI.7AJJI.7E7SS.7E7SS.7E7SS.7AJJc.7AJJc.7AJJc.76Sk2.76Sk2.76Sk2.76Ns0.76Ns0.76Ns0.7E50C.76VAc?lang=en)**

*A furry Defender of the forests*

A combo deck built around Ladica and Fairies. A strong deck that sees ample play at tournaments and a fair amount on ladder too. Deck build continues to be quite staple as it has been figured out and there's no real experiementation with it either. 

**[Sekka Forest](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.1.76QHo.76QHo.76QHo.7AJJS.7AJJS.7AJJS.7Hv9C.7Hv9C.7Hv9C.7Hvtw.7Hvtw.7Hvtw.7Hsj6.7Hsj6.7Hsj6.7LlkI.7LlkI.7LlkI.7AHbw.7AEw2.7AEw2.7AEw2.76VAc.76VAc.76VAc.7AJJI.7AJJI.7AJJI.7AJJc.7AJJc.7AJJc.76Sk2.76Sk2.76Sk2.7Hxbc.7Hxbc.7Hxbc.76Ns0.76Ns0.76Ns0?lang=en)**

*A thousand biting arrows*

A midrange/combo deck built around Sekka and Fairies. A strong yet not quite as tournament popular deck. But it is more popular on ladder due to it's more straightforward nature in relative comparison to Ladica Forest.

**[Annihilation Forest](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.1.7Hvtw.7Hvtw.7Lk0w.7Lk0w.7Lk0w.7Dibi.7Dibi.7Dibi.7HWki.7HWki.7LNJy.7LNJy.7LNJy.76SkM.76SkM.76SkM.7E07Y.7E07Y.7E07Y.7Lgs6.7Lgs6.7Lgs6.7LjI2.7LjI2.7LjI2.7Llkc.7Llkc.7Llkc.7LlkS.7LlkS.7LlkS.7Hsio.7Hsio.7Hsio.7HZAo.7HZAo.7HZAo.76Ns0.76Ns0.76Ns0?lang=en)**

*Laying waste to all before them*

A control deck built around Izudia. A fringe deck that sees some play here and there but in comparison to the other Forest decks isn't as strong nor as fast. But it does offer a different playstyle that some players like and so it continues to see some play.

---

**Swordcraft**

In the Eternal Castle of Swordcraft, where countless thousands of knights reside along with an even larger number of maids and butlers. We find Albert and Seofon in the process of being punished by Nahtnaught after they found it amusing to pull a prank on her. She was not amused and she is more than happy to put her displeasure on display.

For Swordcraft Rally sword continues to hold the banner high followed closely by Corpsmaster Rally Sword and finally a bit of Evo Sword.

Swordcraft continues to sit in a comfortable position, certainly not the top, but definitely not the bottom either. Continuing to be one of the more aggressive classes in the meta with some amount of variety to it. All driven in large part by the Corpsmaster buff.

**[Rally Sword](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.2.7M3Gc.7M3Gc.7M3Gc.7AfHi.7AfHi.7AfHi.7EOYM.7EOYM.7EOYM.7EQ-S.7EQ-S.7EQ-S.7IHZY.7IHZY.7IHZY.7EVt6.7EVt6.7EVt6.7M0q2.7M0q2.7M0q2.7M88o.7M88o.7M88o.7M88y.7M88y.7M88y.7IKkg.7IKkg.7ETQY.7ETQY.7ETQY.7IJ_o.7IJ_o.7M5iY.7M5iY.7IKkg.7IJ_o.5-Hb2.5-Hb2?lang=en)**

*Knights in Gleaming armour*

A midrange deck built around Rally and evolving. A solid deck and so far seemingly still the most popular Sword deck. More of them are starting to get a bit more aggressive though not quite full on Corpsmaster rally either. And they still continue to run some evolve elements like Claymore master.

**[Corpsmaster Rally](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.2.5-Hb2.5-Hb2.5-Hb2.7AcrS.7AcrS.7AcrS.7M0qM.7M0qM.7M0qM.5-HbC.5-HbC.7AfHi.7AfHi.7AfHi.7EOYM.7EOYM.7EQ-S.7EQ-S.7EQ-S.7EVsy.7EVsy.7EVsy.7EVt6.7EVt6.7EVt6.7IJ_y.7IJ_y.7IJ_y.7M88y.7M88y.7M88y.7M8tg.7M8tg.7M8tg.7IJ_o.7IJ_o.7IJ_o.7ETQY.7ETQY.7ETQY?lang=en)**

*A Legion led by Champions*

A tempo deck built around Rallying into Frenzied Corpsmaster as fast as possible. Getting ever more popular there's also a lot of varying builds on it. This particular build was used by Spicies at a recent tournament and shows how some decks are starting to cut most of the hollow package to go even more aggressive, including cards like Oathless Knight. Which is when you know rally is getting serious. Still, not all decks are so quick to cut the hollow package. But there's definitely a growing momentum towards more aggressive builds.

**[Evo Sword](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.2.7M3Gc.7M3Gc.7M3Gc.76r8Y.76r8Y.7AfHi.7AfHi.7AfHi.7EQ-S.7EQ-S.7EQ-S.7EVsy.7EVt6.7EVt6.7EVt6.7M0q2.7M0q2.7M88o.7M88o.7M88o.7M88y.7M88y.7M88y.7IKkg.7IKkg.7IKkg.7M8tg.7M8tg.7ETQY.7ETQY.7ETQY.7IJ_o.7IJ_o.7IJ_o.7M5iY.7M5iY.7M5iY.7IHZY.7IHZY.7IHZY?lang=en)**

*A band of heroes*

A midrange deck built around Evolve synergies. A fringe deck that covers a large number of decks that in some way or the other makes use of evolve more actively. Some run Mirin, some run Jupiter. Also not uncommon to see Gilnelise in some of the more slow and control oriented builds of the deck. But compared to the more rally focused, they remain a minority as the strategy is slower and at times a bit awkward.

---

**Runecraft**

In the great mystical academies of Runecraft, where vast libraries reach farther than the eye can see, their halls filled with all manner of knowledge. Today we arrive to find Kuon trying to steal more golem making secrets from Erasmus and he is having none of it! His solution ? Spread rumours that Kuon has been making moves on Grea, causing Anne to go Ballistic and go after Kuon. Never mess with an Arch Conjurer.

For Runecraft Evo Rune continues to hold top billing, followed by Chaos Rune, Spellboost Rune and Burn Rune.

Runecraft continues to show decent performance in the meta, even if it is fairly reliant on Evolve Rune, it does have multiple other archetypes. But does lack some strength in them and Earth Rite rune has gone into hibernation once more at this point, awaiting some more cards to *maybe* help it out.

*Sorcerers of Soul*

A midrange deck built around Evolve synergies.  Remaining the most played and strongest Runecraft deck, it has made a solid return and has generally settled around a midrange build. Some players do try to go control, but they tend to be a minority.

*CHAOS!*

A combo deck built around Whims of Chaos and Raio. A fairly popular ladder deck due to it's chaotic nature. The deck has seen a slight decline due to the rise in more aggressive Sword and Dragon decks that can make things much tougher for the deck. Still against slower decks it can cause a real mess.

*The elements of Magic*

A midrange deck built around spellboost synergies. A fringe deck that sees some play here and there. But overall in the current meta the deck is struggling to gain proper footing and can find itself easily outpaced. As it currently stands it will either need more buffs or new cards to really stand out more in the meta.

*Applied Pyromancy*

A Burn/combo deck built around having less than 20 cards in your deck. A fringe deck that sees a tiny bit of play here and there by people who like the playstyle. But the current meta environment is not particularly great for it to climb in.

**Dragoncraft**

In the great caverns of Dragoncraft, where draconic behemoths slumber for Aeons, dutifully tended to by generations of Dragonewt servants.  Forte is busy checking up on the dragon vaults to make sure everything is as it is supposed to be when she notices that Ignis Dragon isn't where it's supposed to be. Only to realise that Hiro snuck it out again for some mischief.. She's going to have to get Rowen to give him another stern talking to.

For Dragoncraft Disdain Dragon takes the lead, followed by Natura Dragon, Buff Dragon and a bit of Mjerrabaine Dragon.

Dragoncraft is in a strong position with multiple strong decks. As it can punch it's way through a variety of contenders in the meta thanks to Galmiuex and the new Ardor cards. Which has generally given Dragoncraft a strong boost in the offence department, an area where Dragoncraft was already doing fairly well.

**[Disdain Dragon](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.4.7Mq5c.7Mq5c.7Mq5c.7BQrQ.7BQrQ.7BQrQ.7MtGQ.7MtGQ.7MtGQ.7LLca.7LLca.7LLca.7Muzo.7Muzo.5_38w.5_38w.5_38w.7FGi6.7FGi6.7FGi6.77eQ6.77eQ6.77eQ6.7J4r6.7J4r6.7J4r6.7HWkY.7HWkY.7HWkY.7BQ6Y.7BQ6Y.7BQ6Y.7Mu-6.7Mu-6.7Mu-6.7Muzo.77aGA.7J4qo.7J4qo.7J4qo?lang=en)**

*Burning through the skies*

A tempo deck built around ramping into strong threats and Disdain. It has steadily climbed to become the nr 1 Dragoncraft deck over the last week. Mixing in a lot of already strong offensive cards with Galmiuex and her Ardor package for more burn damage and card draw along with Birth of the Ravenous. A strong deck and one to watch out for.

**[Natura Dragon](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.4.7DjKQ.7DjKQ.7DjKQ.7FCYA.7FCYA.7FCYA.7MoNw.7MtGQ.7MtGQ.7MtGQ.7FBpI.7FBpI.7FBpI.5_38w.5_38w.5_38w.7FEFY.7FEFY.7FEFY.7FGi6.7FGi6.7FGi6.77eQ6.77eQ6.77eQ6.7J4r6.7J4r6.7J4r6.7HWkY.7HWkY.7HWkY.7Dlmg.7Dlmg.7Dlmg.7BQ6Y.7BQ6Y.7BQ6Y.7Mu-6.7Mu-6.7Mu-6?lang=en)**

*Tyrants of the forests*

A tempo deck built around Natura and strong threats. At this point basically an off-shoot of Disdain Dragon but with Natura for it's own burn damage and other benefits. Not quite as strong or fast, but certainly close to and quite popular too.

**[Buff Dragon](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.4.7BQrQ.7BQrQ.7BQrQ.7I-Ew.7I-Ew.7I-Ew.7MtGQ.7MtGQ.7MtGQ.7BNgS.7BNgS.7BNgS.7IzW2.7IzW2.7IzW2.7J4qy.7J4qy.7Mq5I.7Mq5I.5_38w.5_38w.5_38w.7F9NC.7F9NC.7FGi6.7FGi6.7FGi6.7J4r6.7J4r6.7J4r6.7Mu-6.7Mu-6.7Mu-6.7BSYy.7BSYy.7BSYy.7FEFi.7FEFi.7FEFi.7F9NC?lang=en)**

*Hardening the Soul and the body*

A midrange deck built around buffing your followers. Strong but not quite as popular as Disdain and Natura take the lead. Their more linear and easy to execute strategy along with more speed means that while buff Dragon is still quote good. It's just not as popular. Why spend time buffing when you could be smashing faces ?

**[Mjerrabaine Dragon](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.4.7BQrQ.7I-Ew.7Dibi.7HWki.7LF_2.7LKtY.7LLcQ.7LLcQ.7IzW2.7Muzo.5_38w.5_38w.5_38w.7BLyw.7F9NC.7FGi6.7HUII.77eQ6.7J4r6.7HWkY.767Ug.7Mu-6.7Dl1o.7Dl1o.7Dl1o.7HZAo.7LNJo.7LNJo.7LNJo.7BLEM.7BSYy.7FBpS.7LKti.7J2Oi.7J4qo.7J4qo.7J4qo.77ZXS.77ePy.7FGi6?lang=en)**

*These Dragons bow to only one master*

A highlander deck built around Mjerrabaine. A fringe deck that is mostly played for fun. But does see usage on the ladder as it is probably the one that can make the best use of Mjerrabaine.

**Shadowcraft**

In the great catacombs of Shadowcraft, where it turns out not everyone is not equal in death. Amy suddenly finds herself dealing with a leader who's been skulking about in the shadows so far and has avoided the notice of the grand overlord of death, Luna.. Tsukikage. Who's just been milling about randomly killing things and having a laugh at it all. Amy doesn't know how to handle him and just runs away, hoping Mordecai can take care of it.

Shadowcraft Sees Evolve Shadow take the lead, followed by Last words Shadow and Ceres OTK shadow.

*Even the soul can be made to serve*

A midrange deck built around Evolution and Necromancy. Steadily regaining it's position as number 1 Shadowcraft deck as it swings back into the last words package with a vengeance. Even utilizing the nerfed wicked rebirth. While some still run a deck more focused on Ruleneye, these are quickly becoming a tiny minority.

**[Last words Shadow](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.5.7Ff6c.7Ff6c.7NAoQ.7NAoQ.7NAoQ.7BqzS.7BqzS.7BqzS.7NEy2.7NEy2.7NEy2.7BpFw.7BpFw.7BpFw.7BoXC.7BoXC.7BoXC.7FXnY.7FXnY.7FXnY.7NDEg.7NDEg.7NDEg.780qc.780qc.780qc.7Bqzc.7Bqzc.7Bqzc.7NHOS.7NHOS.7NHOS.7LKti.7LKti.7LKti.7JTFI.7JTFI.7NA3s.7NA3s.7NA3s?lang=en)**

*No rest, only servitude*

A midrange deck built around last words. A strong deck, but getting less popular as Evolve shadow is co-opting the Last words package once more, leaving last words shadow a bit on the slower end in comparison. So while strong, it's not quite as fast or consistent.

**[Ceres OTK Shadow](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.5.7DgeY.7Ff6c.7Ff6c.7Ff6c.7NFgw.7NFgw.7NFgw.77vW0.77vW0.77vW0.7NEy2.7NEy2.7NEy2.7BpFw.7BpFw.7BpFw.7BqzI.7BqzI.7BqzI.7NDEg.7NDEg.7NDEg.7FaDy.7FaDy.7FaDy.7Fcg2.7Fcg2.7Fcg2.7Bqzc.7Bqzc.7Bqzc.7NCW6.7NCW6.7NCW6.7LKti.7LKti.7LKti.7NA3s.7NA3s.7NA3s?lang=en)**

*An unholy union of Yandere and Machine*

An OTK deck built around Ceres. A solid yet slowly vaning deck after the initial surge. The increase in more aggressive decks from Dragon and Sword definitely posing a problem for the deck. Still it has it's fans and is a deck to watch out for on the ladder.

---

**Bloodcraft**

In the great house of sin and debauchery that is bloodcraft. Where ancient pacts made with demons in ages past, keeps the rent affordable. We find Yuzuki once more looking miserable as her deck has quickly vanished into thin air leaving Urias to cheer her up.. Who doesn't have a clue as how to do it, pushes the task unto Mono and scarpers.

For Bloodcraft Wrath Blood is pretty much the only deck with only a tiny smattering of Mjerrabaine blood decks around otherwise.

Bloodcraft is in a curious spot. Effectively a one deck class for the most part. Wrath is fine.. But the rest of the class is in dire straits and really needs some help pushing up the deck diversity fast.

**[Wrath Blood](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.6.78Hw2.78Hw2.78Hw2.7Nawc.7Nawc.7Nawc.7JkqI.7JkqI.7JkqI.7C8VI.7C8VI.7C8VI.5_p-4.5_p-4.7JpyQ.7JpyQ.7JpyQ.7G1X6.7G1X6.7G1X6.7Jrfy.7Jrfy.7Jrfy.7Nfp6.7Nfp6.7Nfp6.78Moi.78Moi.7JmnI.7JmnI.7JmnI.7FwCM.7FwCM.7FwCM.78PEy.7G1Wy.7G1Wy.7JmnS.7JmnS.7JmnS?lang=en)**

*A Juggernaut of Pain and fury*

A midrange deck built around Wrath. A solid deck that still sees a good amount of play. Besides that as usual there's a number of variations about. Though it does look like the more aggressive Pain Immortal builds are getting a bit more popular as of late.

**[Mjerrabaine Blood](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.6.7Ne5Q.7HSaw.7HSaw.7HSaw.7FyeI.7CDNy.7CDO6.7CAxY.5_p-4.7JpyQ.7NbfA.7Dibi.7HWki.7LLcQ.7LLcQ.78KMI.78KMI.78KMI.7C63M.7Nfoo.7G1X6.7FyeS.7CBgQ.7F_4i.7HWkY.7HWkY.7LNJo.7LNJo.7LNJo.7Dl1o.7Dl1o.5_pFW.7JpDY.7Nfoy.7Nfoy.7Jrg6.7Jrg6.7Jrg6.7LKti.78PEo?lang=en)**

*He holds the power over these demons*

A highlander deck built around Mjerrabaine. A fringe deck that is mostly played for fun, but which does crop up from time to time, similar to Volteo blood before that rotated out.

---

**Havencraft**

In the great summit temple of Havencraft, where angel-like singing can be heard.. and copies bought in the store. We find Elana not entirely sure how to feel about working together with Marwynn and all of his despair. Feeling that is rather against her work ethic, but on the other hand.. he does deal with troublemakers nicely.. So in other words, she's willing to let it slide for now.

For Havencraft Heal haven takes the lead, followed by Ward haven and a bit of Jatelant Haven.

havencraft overall sits in a good position. Not too strong though, but not weak either. A fair amount of deck diversity due to a fairly solid core set of cards. But beyond that, not a lot of fluidity going on atm in the class.

**[Heal Haven](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.7.7GJLQ.7GJLQ.7Dibi.7Dibi.7Dibi.7LNJy.7LNJy.7K7UQ.7Cboc.7Cboc.7KE4S.7KE4S.7KE4S.7CVCQ.7CVCQ.7CVCQ.7NxNo.7NxNo.7NxNo.7O0GI.7O0GI.7O0GI.7GPxc.7GPxc.7GPxc.7O2DS.7O2DS.7O2DS.7O2Dc.7O2Dc.78lDC.78lDC.78lDC.7N_nC.7N_nC.7GL2o.7GL2o.7NzKy.7NzKy.7NzKy?lang=en)**

*Despair at the power of healing!*

A control deck built around healing. It remains in a solid position in the meta. Though it generally seems to have been found out for the most part by now. Able to deal with some of the more burn oriented and aggressive decks fairly well.

**[Ward Haven](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.7.7GNVC.7GNVC.7GNVC.7HWki.7HWki.7HWki.7K9By.7K9By.7K9By.7KBeC.7KBeC.7KBeC.7Nwui.7Nwui.7Nwui.7O2DI.7O2DI.7O2DI.7Nzq2.7Nzq2.7Nzq2.7Cboc.7Cboc.7KE4S.7KE4S.7KE4S.7NzKo.7NzKo.7CWvy.7CWvy.7CWvy.7CUTs.7CUTs.7CUTs.7HZAo.7HZAo.7HZAo.7N_n2.7N_n2.7N_n2?lang=en)**

*A host of a thousand shields*

A midrange deck built around wards. A decent deck, but one that has fallen a bit on hard times with the rise of Dragon that can easily punch through all of the wards, combined with other troublesome decks has seen ward haven fall down a bit in the meta as of late.

**[Jatelant Haven](https://shadowverse-portal.com/deck/3.7.7DjKQ.7DjKQ.7DjKQ.7DgeY.7DgeY.7DgeY.7GPxS.7GPxS.7GPxS.7GN-I.7GN-I.7GN-I.7NxNo.7NxNo.7NxNo.7O2DS.7O2DS.7O2DS.78jVg.78jVg.78jVg.78lDC.78lDC.78lDC.7GL2o.7GL2o.7GL2o.7KE4I.7KE4I.7KE4I.7KE4c.7KE4c.7KE4c.7LKti.7LKti.7CboS.7CboS.7CboS.78lSg.78lSg?lang=en)**

*A thousand prayers turned to blessings*

A combo deck built around Jatelant and Amulets. A fringe deck that sees a bit of play here and there. But overall finds itself struggling quite a bit in the current meta as it lacks anything particularly threatening to really stand out with.

**Portalcraft**

In the vertex colony high in orbit over a long dead world. Massive waffle halls once proudly churning out near infinite amounts of waffles now stand empty, only filled with dust and broken dreams.
We find Belphomet tinkering with his machines when Orchis walks in on him asking if he could fix Lloyd for her. And without any ""Improvements"" he agrees, a bit disheartened though as he always felt like Lloyd would be much better with a few death rays attached to him.

For Portalcraft we find Artifact Portal still at the top, followed by Puppet Portal and a bit of Machina Portal.

Portalcraftcraft continues to be in a good spot. But overall not a lot has changed since the last week except a few decks getting more refined. But overall, the class continues to be good, but lacking anything more exceptional.

*Unreal death machines*

A midrange deck built around artifacts. A strong deck, there's a shift towards cutting Lishenna again and this particular build apparently managed a 47 match winstreak. Not sure about that, but pretty damn impressive if it did. Either way, a solid yet fairly skill intensive deck.

A control deck built around Machina. A fringe deck that sees a bit of play here and there. But at this point lacks better control tools to really survive for long enough in the current metagame, it has plenty of lategame ,problem is getting there.

This week is seeing some fair amount of optimization going on with Corpsmaster sword in particular being the focus of a lot of work this week. But Dragon has also been polished quite a bit. That said not too much in new decks and Blood continues to be stuck in a really awkward spot. We'll have to see what the next few weeks will bring. Never mind what they're planning for the end of February now that they moved the mini expansion to the start of it. Fairly curious about

This is my first attempt at an alternative future. The Break-Up of Australia.,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9i4r686r6jh81.png?width=6000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ca0f3bceff13b044f85d77af00688b6401bf8e6

In 2028, after an incredibly narrow victory in yet another highly controversial Republic Referendum, featuring the latest ""Choice"" model; winning just shy of 2% over the 50% margin, the Commonwealth of Australia becomes the Republic of Australia. Removing all vestiges of the Australian Crown and safeguards against tyranny and despotism.

Before the Referendum itself was put forth to the people, in Western Australia, due to the popularity of Western Australian secession, faction leaders conspired to push for a Republic only so that the Western Australian state can succeed since in their reasoning, Western Australia only accepted to join the COMMONWEALTH of Australia, under the CROWN, not a Republic of Australia. In secret, these factions amalgamated to form the Westralian Autarchs, a group of powerful figures, from ceo's of mining conglomerates to business leaders, bureaucrats and the political elite. The Westralian Autarchs vied for complete separation from any Republican form of government as a means for Western Australia to become it's own country. With the narrow victory of the Republic Referendum, the Westralian Autarchs pressured the West Australian Parliament to announce it's intentions to hold another Referendum on seceding from the rest of Australia. Such a move brought much anger from the Eastern States except for Queensland, which was having it's own internal problems. But with a large lead of 70% approval for separation, the Western Australian Government effectively secedes from the Republic of Australia, viewing such a Republic as a foreign government, cutting all ties to it and going it's own way, securing it's borders with a militia force and encouraging those in the Republican Army to defect back to Western Australia. However, the Westralia Autarchs seize the opportunity to take control of Perth, and creating an Autarchy. Inspired by Autarkism, self-sufficiency and independence would remain as the identity of Western Australia, now renamed the Autarchy of Westralia, headed by a Council of Autarchs. 

Following the shock of Western Australia leaving the Republic, Queensland, being the stronghold of Monarchism in Australia, lobbies for it's own separation from the Republic of Australia, viewing the Referendum as tainted by foreign actors, political and self-serving interests. However, the process would be muddled due to lack of coordination. Grassroots movements will push and lobby for a Referendum, however, the Labor held government resisted such a move. Which only inspires the Queenslander populace to lobby more, protest more and rally daily around the Brisbane Parliament. It won't be until a small group called ""The Loyalists"" invaded into the parliament whilst it's members were all in attendance, holding them hostage and proclaiming the Loyal Dominion of Queensland. But, with King Charles III not wishing to be used by a rebellious movement to be their source for legitimacy would denounce such an insurrection. Whilst being a popular insurrection within Queensland, the Kings denunciation does not deter monarchist sentiment and instead The Loyalists pursue to invite extended members of the Windsor Family to become Queensland's Sovereign, and if that wouldn't work, The Loyalists intend to invite the Australian born Royal; Earl of Loudoun, to become the Sovereign of the Loyal Dominion of Queensland.

The Republic of Australia, after having two of it's most resource rich states declare independence, either through Referendums and Insurrections, felt the economic, cultural and societal impacts of such moves. The Republican Army fractured into different regiments loyal to their home states (now turned countries), the political shock caused the Left Wing Republican Movement to doubled down even harder causing those who didn't vote for the Republic in the rural and outer suburbs to protest at the erasure of the Australian Identity as the Republican Movement and it's allies in the Labor and Greens parties ignore such protests, labelling them as ""White Supremacists"" and ""Radical Alt-Right Colonialists"" and continuing to dismantle the previous Australian identity and to install a new identity based upon progressive ideological lines. The new Republic faces immense problems as it's Presidential system comes under intense scrutiny as the President, whom of which is elected differently from the parliamentarians, concentrates more and more power towards themselves in an attempt to ""Unify"" the fragmented country.

Such a despotic move inspires South Australians to declare their intentions for secession. Surprisingly, the Republican government, under intense pressure, deals to give South Australia authority and control over the Northern Territory due to the governments inability to aid rural communities and to quash any monarchist and australian uprisings. As well as more autonomy akin to China's policy with Hong Kong, giving South Australia the ability to chart it's own path whilst being under the Republics yoke. With the concession being made, South Australia, agreeing to the Republican Governments deal, allows for the Republican Government to rename the state into the Dependency of Centralia.

However, such a concession only leads to more calls for secession. Popularly elected MPs in the Centralian parliament push and call for separation, only to be tyrannically silenced by the ever-despotic Republican Government. 

Victoria and New South Wales, being the two axis of the Republic, attempt to make this ""Choice"" model work. However, with the political instability and literal balkanization of Australia, the President continues to concentrate more power to themselves, only to be stopped by the Prime Minister. However, calling on the loyalty of the Army, the President surrounds Parliament House with the Republican Army, overthrowing the Parliament in a power-hungry coup, under the pretense of ""Securing the Unity of the Nation"". The ""Choice"" model created nothing short of a dictatorship within the Republic of Australia.

The Republic itself is nothing but a rump state, controlled by the iron fist of the Tyrant-President. Many within the Republic often ask if it was worth voting for a Republic. After all, it only led to the dissolution of the Commonwealth, separation of the states and a dictatorship. Many within the rurals, outer suburbs and even some within the inner suburbs create undeground networks, determined to undermine and destroy the corrupt politicans republic, and to restore the Commonwealth of Australia. These underground factions loosely call themselves, ""Mills""; as the name implies, they intend to grind down the Tyrant-President, and their Republic. Much of these ""Mills"" are concentrated in Tasmania, a safer location away from the mainland to create splinter cells. The Tasmanian government is ineffective to hunt down the Mills as the Mills hide in Tasmania's forested and hilly interior, training new Mills to destabilize the Republic in anyway they can.

In spite of all of this, the Republican Government, viewing Queensland and Westralia as rebellious states, intend to gain them back through violent means. The Tyrant-President had ordered the Republican Army to station near the borders of the two countries, whilst the Navy and Airforce are on stand-by. Noticing the military build up on their borders, Queensland and Westralia form a defense pact; conscripting their populace to defend their newly formed countries from the Oppressive Republicans. With a declaration of Unity, on the 29th of April, 2031, the Tyrant-President declared war on Westralia and Queensland. The War of Australia had begun.

"""Indeed Very Many""? Part 3: Second-Century Apologists","[Part 2 (The Apostolic Fathers)](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6474633049677334506/7984813256207256558#)

'Universalism as heresy' has been the default position of the church for nearly 1500 years, alongside the idea of 'infernalism (eternal torment) as orthodoxy'. For this reason, it's hard for many Christians to picture a time in which universalism might have been considered orthodox, and the idea of eternal torment heretical. However, modern sentiments on this issue notwithstanding, the fact is that universalism was actually the majority view for the first four hundred years of the church's existence. In fact, until the time of Augustine of Hippo, who was one of the first mainstream infernalists, the eventual salvation of all was proclaimed by major champions of orthodoxy such as Irenaeus of Lyons, the three Cappadocian Fathers, and Jerome of Stridon (a doctor of the Catholic Church). This series of posts will go through the history of patristic thought on hell and universal salvation, with this post focusing on the beliefs of the second-century apologists.

    During the second century, a number of disciples of the apostolic fathers as well as pagan converts began to formulate a systematic theology for Christianity. However, at the same time a number of proto-heresies began to arise in opposition to the orthodoxy. These included gnosticism, docetism, Sabellianism (modalistic monarchism), and several others. This post will examine the beliefs of several prominent second-century individuals, including both orthodox apologists and gnostics, regarding the eschatological fate of unbelievers.

 **Justin Martyr**

Justin Martyr (*c*. 100 - 165) was one of the first Christian apologists. Justin grew up with pagan beliefs and was converted to Platonism at a young age (*Dialogue with Trypho* 2), until he met an old man who converted him to Christianity. In his later life, Justin was a prolific writer, although unfortunately only three of his works survive: two Apologies and a book called *Dialogue with Trypho* which details Justin's attempt to convert Trypho the Jew (who may or may not have actually existed). He was martyred in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, from which he obtained the posthumous name Martyr.

    Unfortunately, the beliefs of Justin Martyr on the fate of unbelievers are unclear, not because he failed to explain them but because he gave conflicting opinions throughout his writings. However, the old man who converted him is plainly a conditionalist, as he believed that the soul was not inherently immortal and that unbelievers would be annihilated after a set time of punishment:  


&gt;""**Nor ought \[the soul\] to be called immortal**; for if it is immortal, it is plainly unbegotten... But I do not say, indeed, that all souls die; for that were truly a piece of good fortune to the evil. What then? The souls of the pious remain in a better place, while those of the unjust and wicked are in a worse, waiting for the time of judgment. Thus some which have appeared worthy of God never die; but **others are punished so long as God wills them to exist** and to be punished."" (*Dialogue with Trypho* 5)

Likewise, elsewhere in the *Dialogue with Trypho*, Justin seems to adhere to a conditionalist belief. He states in chapter 45 that he believes only the righteous will receive immortality, whereas the devil and his angels along with sinners ""may be destroyed... and be no more, when some are sent to be punished unceasingly into judgment and condemnation of fire; but others shall exist... in immortality"". Because of the emphasis on destruction and annihilation, it is highly likely that Justin had conditional immortality in mind here rather than infernalism or universalism.

    However, there are also many passages from Justin's *First Apology* that seem, rather, to support infernalism instead of conditionalism:  


&gt;And Plato, in like manner, used to say that Rhadamanthus and Minos would punish the wicked who came before them; and we say that the same thing will be done, but at the hand of Christ, and upon the wicked in the same bodies united again to their spirits which are now to undergo eonian punishment; and not only, as Plato said, for a period of a thousand years. (*First Apology* 8)  
&gt;  
&gt;For reflect upon the end of each of the preceding kings, how they died the death common to all, which, if issued in insensibility, would be a godsend to all the wicked. But since sensation remains to all who have ever lived, and eonian punishment is laid up, see that you neglect not to be convinced, and to hold as your belief, that these things are true. (*First Apology* 18)

First of all, we must note where Justin's apparent belief in infernalism came from. It did not spring from the convictions of the old man who converted him, as he was a conditionalist and not an infernalist. Instead, it apparently came from his previous Platonism, since in the first quote, he clearly attributes the origin of his belief in this doctrine as Plato; however, instead of being at the hands of Rhadamanthus and Minos, it will be at the hand of Christ, and instead of being a thousand years, it will be eonian.

    Second, note that however damning these passages may seem against Justin's previous acceptance of conditionalism in *Dialogue with Trypho*, he never actually states that the punishment will be absolutely eternal - that is, in Greek, αιδιος - but instead says that it will be 'eonian', αιωνιος. The 'thousand years' likely refers to Christ's Messianic kingdom, which Justin did believe would last for a literal millennium (*Dialogue with Trypho* 80-81), and so he could simply be refuting the belief that the punishment would last for the Millennium and no longer.

    Moreover, these passages are in a pastoral context and not a pedagogical one; Justin is attempting to convert people from paganism to Christianity, and so of course he would make the condemnation of unbelievers seem worse than it actually will be, which is also a device used in the contemporaneous *Apocalypse of Peter* as described earlier. Therefore, we cannot be sure whether Justin believed in infernalism or conditionalism, although it is almost certain that he did not believe in universalism.  


&gt;**Tatian the Assyrian**

Tatian (*c*. 120 - 180) was a Gnostic apologist who helped to form the first Syrian church. Although he was originally an orthodox Christian and a disciple of Justin Martyr, his contemporary Irenaeus says that after Justin's martyrdom, Tatian left the Church and began to associate with Gnostic ideas like those of the early second-century heretic Valentinus, an infernalist (*Against Heresies* 1.28.1). Several of his works survive today, most notably the *Diatesseron* (a harmony of the four Gospels) and his *Address to the Greeks*.

    Tatian came up with his doctrine on the fate of unbelievers, a particularly undesirable form of infernalism, as a bastardization of the Gnostic infernalism of Valentinus and the (possibly conditionalist) eschatology of his teacher Justin Martyr. He agreed with Valentinus' division of humanity into three classes: the material class (unbelievers), the psychic class (Christians), and the spiritual class (Gnostics). The material class, according to Tatian, would not have immortal souls; instead, their souls would die at the death of their body, only to be raised up again in immortality for punishment.  


&gt;The soul is not in itself immortal, O Greeks, but mortal. Yet it is possible for it not to die. If, indeed, it knows not the truth, it dies, and is dissolved with the body, but rises again at last at the end of the world with the body, receiving death by punishment in immortality. But, again, if it acquires the knowledge of God, it dies not, although for a time it be dissolved. (*Address to the Greeks* 13)   
&gt;  
&gt;And as we, to whom it now easily happens to die, afterwards receive the immortal with enjoyment, or the painful with immortality, so the demons, who abuse the present life to purposes of wrong-doing, dying continually even while they live, will have hereafter the same immortality, like that which they had during the time they lived, but in its nature like that of men, who voluntarily performed what the demons prescribed to them during their lifetime. (*Address to the Greeks* 14)

However, for his particularly Gnostic form of infernalism in which even Adam himself was a 'material' man who would be punished eternally, Tatian was condemned by the orthodox and universalist apologist Irenaeus of Lyons:

&gt;\[Tatian\] entangled himself with all the heretics... endeavoring from time to time to employ sayings of this kind often by Paul: ""In Adam we all die"", ignorant, however, that ""where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."" (*Against Heresies* 3.23.8)

Therefore, Tatian clearly believed in infernalism and followed his Gnostic teacher Valentinus (and possibly Justin Martyr) in this respect.

&gt;**Irenaeus of Lyons**

Irenaeus (*c*. 130 - 202) was a bishop of Lyons in modern-day France, a prominent Christian apologist who helped to formulate modern orthodoxy as we know it. His major work *Against Heresies* was monumental in combating the growing Gnostic heresy as well as a number of other heterodox doctrines. Unfortunately, very few fragments of the original Greek text of this work are available, and most of it is only available in Latin or Armenian, which creates ambiguity as to whether, for example, Irenaeus used the word αιωνιος ('eonian') or αιδιος ('eternal') to refer to punishment, both of which are translated into Latin as *aeternum*.

    It is sometimes said that because Irenaeus used the terms 'eonian punishment', 'eonian fire', 'furnace of fire', 'weeping and gnashing of teeth', *et cetera*, that he must have been an infernalist. However, this ignores the fact that all three views of soteriology - infernalism, conditionalism, and universalism - believe that these biblical terms are compatible with, or even better suited to, their own beliefs. Therefore, these terms cannot be used to show that Irenaeus believed in any one of these three views, since he was merely quoting these terms from the Bible which all three views believe is inspired. Apart from this, there are two main passages from *Against Heresies* that are often used to support the idea that Irenaeus was an infernalist or a conditionalist:  


&gt;For life does not arise from us, nor from our own nature; but it is bestowed according to the grace of God. And therefore he who shall preserve the life bestowed upon him, and give thanks to Him who imparted it, shall receive also length of days for the age of the age. But he who shall reject it, and prove himself ungrateful to his Maker, inasmuch as he has been created, and has not recognised Him who bestowed, deprives himself of continuance for the age of the age. And, for this reason, the Lord declared to those who showed themselves ungrateful towards Him: “If you have not been faithful in that which is little, who will give you that which is great?” indicating that those who, in this brief temporal life, have shown themselves ungrateful to Him who bestowed it, **shall justly not receive from Him length of days for the age of the age**. (*Against Heresies* 2.34.3)  
&gt;  
&gt;Those, therefore, who cast away by apostasy these forementioned things, being in fact destitute of all good, do experience every kind of punishment. God, however, does not punish them immediately of Himself, but that punishment falls upon them because they are destitute of all that is good. Now, good things are **eonian and without end** with God, and therefore the loss of these is also **eonian and never-ending**. It is in this matter just as occurs in the case of a flood of light: those who have blinded themselves, or have been blinded by others, are for ever deprived of the enjoyment of light. (*Against Heresies* 5.27.2)

The first passage is often understood by conditionalists as stating that unbelievers will be annihilated for ""ever and ever"". This is a misunderstanding, however, of the Latin underlying the passage, which says ""*juste non percipient ab eo in saeculum saeculi longitudenum dierum*""; the phrase ""*in saeculum saeculi*"" is a literal rendering of the Greek phrase εις τον αιωνα του αιωνος, 'for the age of the age'. This is regarded by some as referring to the eschatological age of the Millennium, thus demonstrating the biblical truth that unbelievers will not be resurrected until after the Messianic kingdom (Revelation 20:4-6), which would be entirely compatible with the other passages from Irenaeus demonstrating universalism.

    The second passage is more difficult to reconcile with the other universalist passages from *Against Heresies*. The underlying Greek text which is available for this fragment describes the punishment of unbelievers as αιωνιος ('eonian') and ατελευτητος ('without end'). Although the word 'eonian' does not describe eternality and is often used in the LXX and New Testament to refer to temporal things, ατελευτητος carries with it a sense of eternality. Unfortunately, what Irenaeus meant when writing this passage (or even if this passage might be an interpolation) can't be determined for sure, and it should be interpreted in light of the many universalist passages in *Against Heresies* as quoted below.  


    Apart from the two passages above, Irenaeus in *Against Heresies* is overwhelmingly universalist in his theology. A few of the passages that support this are quoted below.  


&gt;There is therefore, as I have pointed out, one God the Father, and one Christ Jesus, who came by means of the whole dispensational arrangements, and **gathered together all things in Himself**… so that as in super-celestial, spiritual, and invisible things, the Word of God is supreme, so also in things visible and corporeal He might possess the supremacy, and, taking to Himself the pre-eminence, as well as constituting Himself Head of the Church, **He might draw all things to Himself at the proper time**. (*Against Heresies* 3.16.6)  
&gt;  
&gt;Now Adam had been conquered, all life having been taken away from him: wherefore, when the foe was conquered in his turn, Adam received new life; and the last enemy, death, is destroyed, which at the first had taken possession of man. Therefore, when man has been liberated, “what is written shall come to pass, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your sting?” This could not be said with justice, if that man, over whom death did first obtain dominion, were not set free. **For his salvation is death's destruction.** When therefore the Lord vivifies man, that is, Adam, death is at the same time destroyed. (*Against Heresies* 3.23.7)

*Note: this verse only refers to the salvation of Adam, but it is interpreting Adam as the federal head of all of humanity, by which therefore all will be saved at death's destruction (1 Cor. 15:26, Rev. 20:14): ""we are all from him; and as we are from him, therefore have we all inherited his title"" (Against Heresies 3.23.2).*

&gt;although some, not knowing the power and promise of God, may oppose their own salvation, deeming it impossible for God, who raises up the dead, to have power to confer upon them eternal duration, yet the scepticism of men of this stamp shall not render the faithfulness of God of none effect. (*Against Heresies* 5.5.2)  
&gt;  
&gt;And undoubtedly the preaching of the Church is true and steadfast, in which one and the same way of salvation is shown throughout the whole world. For to her is entrusted the light of God; and therefore the ‘wisdom’ of God, **by means of which she saves all men** (*Against Heresies* 5.20.1)  
&gt;  
&gt;He has therefore, in **His work of recapitulation, summed up all things**, both waging war against our enemy, and crushing him who had at the beginning led us away captives in Adam… in order that, as our species went down to death through a vanquished man, so we may ascend to life again through a victorious one; and as through a man death received the palm against us, so again by a man we may receive the palm against death. (*Against Heresies* 5.21.1)

An even more clearly universalist passage written by Irenaeus can be found in the *Fragments* attributed to him. This passage not only describes the Origenian universal apokatastasis in no uncertain terms, but relates it to the consummation (τελος) of the ages, just as Paul does in 1 Corinthians 15:24 and as Origen later did as well.  


&gt;Christ, who was called the Son of God before the ages, was manifested in the fullness of time, in order that He might cleanse us through His blood, who were under the power of sin, presenting us as pure sons to His Father, if we yield ourselves obediently to the chastisement of the Spirit. And in the end \[τελος\] of time **He shall come to do away with all evil, and to reconcile all things, in order that there may be an end of all impurities**. (*Fragments* 39)

Therefore, despite the few passages which are sometimes used to 'prove' that Irenaeus was actually an infernalist, we can be almost certain that Irenaeus believed in a universal reconciliation at the consummation of the ages. This is highly significant, since he was the champion of orthodoxy in his day; if he believed in universalism, then it must have been an orthodox doctrine during the second century.

&gt;**Theophilus of Antioch**

Theophilus (d. 183) was a patriarch of the city of Antioch and an early Christian apologist, alongside Justin Martyr and Irenaeus. Only one of his works survives to this day, his *Apology to Autolycus*, although he was said to have written numerous anti-heresy works and commentaries.

    Theophilus repeatedly refers to the righteous judgment of God which He will send upon the wicked and unbelieving (*Apology to Autolycus* 1.7, 1.14, 2.37), and that He uses the eonian fire to carry out this punishment. However, as stated previously, this is merely biblical terminology which is used and agreed upon by infernalism, conditionalism, and universalism alike. Moreover, he seems to suggest that it will be possible, though undesirable, to repent afterward:  


&gt;Admitting, therefore, the proof which events happening as predicted afford, I do not disbelieve, but I believe, obedient to God, whom, if you please, do you also submit to, believing Him, lest if now you continue unbelieving, **you be convinced hereafter, when you are tormented with eonian punishments** (*Apology to Autolycus* 1.14)

Theophilus also seems to believe that all those who do not repent in this life will eventually be saved in the next. In the second book of his *Apology*, he exegetes Genesis 1 - 3 using an allegorical hermeneutic by which he interprets each day of creation as a type of unbelievers and/or salvation. In his interpretation of the sixth day of creation, and the formation of wild beasts, Theophilus says that they are a type of unrepentant sinners who will nevertheless be *restored* in the end.

&gt;The quadrupeds, too, and wild beasts, were made for a type of some men, **who neither know nor worship God, but mind earthly things, and repent not**… And the animals are named wild beasts, from their being hunted, not as if they had been made evil or venomous from the first — for nothing was made evil by God, but all things good, yea, very good — but the sin in which man was concerned brought evil upon them. For when man transgressed, they also transgressed with him… When, therefore, man again shall have made his way back to his natural condition, and no longer does evil, **those also shall be restored to their original gentleness**. (*Apology to Autolycus* 2.17)

Another interesting takeaway from this passage is that Theophilus seems to have a similar take on the problem of evil as the later Origen, who believed that evil was not something inherently created by God, but merely the absence of the goodness of God, and so would be annihilated when God became all and ""in all"" (1 Cor. 15:28).

    Later in book two of the *Apology*, Theophilus interprets Adam's expulsion from the Garden of Eden as an act of mercy, by which humanity would later be restored to its original goodness - another important foundation of the doctrine of universal restoration which would later be completely expounded by Origen. He also states that man is in a way 'remolded' and 'made whole' through death and judgment, which is very clearly a description of restorative and corrective judgment and not the hopeless, retributive judgment of infernalism.  


&gt;And God showed great kindness to man in this, that He did not allow him to remain in sin for ever; but, as it were, by a kind of banishment, cast him out of Paradise, in order that, having by punishment expiated, within an appointed time, the sin, and **having been disciplined, he should afterwards be restored**. Wherefore also, when man had been formed in this world, it is mystically written in Genesis, as if he had been twice placed in Paradise; so that the one was fulfilled when he was placed there, and **the second will be fulfilled after the resurrection and judgment**. For just as a vessel, when on being fashioned it has some flaw, is remoulded or remade, that it may become new and entire; so also it happens to man by death. For **somehow or other he is broken up, that he may rise in the resurrection whole**; I mean spotless, and righteous, and immortal. (*Apology to Autolycus* 2.26)

Therefore, Theophilus also believed in universalism and was in good company with his universalist contemporaries, the apologists Irenaeus and Clement of Alexandria.

&gt;**Clement of Alexandria**

Clement (*c*. 150 - 215) was a theologian and teacher of the Christian 'school' at Alexandria. He is widely regarded today as a universalist, and Origen of Alexandria, the first to officially formulate the doctrine of universal restoration, was his pupil. Three of his major works survive today, the *Protrepticus*, *Paedagogus*, and *Stromata*, as well as a short treatise called *Who is the rich man that shall be saved?*

 Throughout Clement's writings, especially his *Stromata*, there is a clear theme of universal salvation. In Clement's estimation, because evil cannot be inherent to the creation lest God be evil, anyone who sins does so out of ignorance and bondage to sin; only those who have been freed from sin, Christians, can voluntarily sin, and yet their sins are not imputed to them because they have been pardoned (*Strom.* 2.15). Therefore, anything short of a universal restoration to goodness would be contrary to God's just nature.  


&gt;Wherefore also **all men are His**; some through knowledge, and others not yet so; and some as friends, some as faithful servants, some as servants merely. This is the Teacher, who trains the Gnostic by mysteries, and the believer by good hopes, and the hard of heart by corrective discipline through sensible operation. Thence His providence is in private, in public, and everywhere… **And how is He Saviour and Lord, if not the Saviour and Lord of all?** But He is the Saviour of those who have believed, because of their wishing to know; and the Lord of those who have not believed, till, being enabled to confess Him, they obtain the peculiar and appropriate boon which comes by Him... Now everything that is virtuous changes for the better; having as the proper cause of change the free choice of knowledge, which the soul has in its own power. But **necessary corrections**, through the goodness of the great overseeing Judge, both by the attendant angels, and by various acts of anticipative judgment, and **by the perfect judgment, compel egregious sinners to repent**. (*Stromata* 7.2)

Elsewhere also, Clement interprets the eonian fire as a judgment meant to correct, not as a retributive or hopeless judgment:

&gt;But we say that the fire sanctifies not flesh, but sinful souls; meaning not the all-devouring vulgar fire but that of wisdom, which pervades the soul passing through the fire. (*Stromata* 7.6)  
&gt;  
&gt;For there are partial corrections, which are called chastisements, which many of us who have been in transgression incur, by falling away from the Lord's people. But as children are chastised by their teacher, or their father, so are we by Providence. But God does not punish, for punishment is retaliation for evil. He chastises, however, for good to those who are chastised, collectively and individually. (*Stromata* 7.16)

Finally, just as Irenaeus of Lyons and later Origen did, Clement connects the eventual apokatastasis or restoration to the consummation:

&gt;And the apostle \[Paul\], succinctly describing the consummation, writes in the Epistle to the Romans: “But now, being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit unto holiness, and the end eonian life”. And viewing the hope as twofold — that which is expected, and that which has been received — **he now teaches the consummation** \[τελος\] **to be the hoped-for restoration** \[αποκαταστασιν\]. (*Stromata* 2.22)

Therefore, we can be sure that Clement of Alexandria was a universalist. His pupil Origen seems to have derived much of his doctrine from Clement's ideas, as well as possibly Irenaeus of Lyons and Theophilus of Antioch as well.

&gt;**Conclusion**

Unfortunately, space did not permit me to write about all of the Christian teachers and apologists of the second century. Otherwise, I might have talked about the apologist known as 'Mathetes', one of the last apostolic fathers, who wrote that he believed the eonian fire would only afflict ""until the consummation \[τελος\]"", or Bardaisan, the Syrian pseudo-Gnostic who taught universal restoration and was a major influence on Origen of Alexandria \[1\]. However, this short rundown of prominent second-century Christian individuals should still give the reader a good idea of how prevalent the idea of universalism was in the early Church, and how it was considered orthodox.

    In summary, although annihilation remained popular among some holdouts from the apostolic age, such as the old man and possibly his disciple Justin Martyr, who likely followed the apostolic fathers Polycarp and (possibly) Ignatius in their conditionalism, Christian universalism became far more prevalent in the second century. Irenaeus of Lyons, the bastion of orthodoxy in his day, was a prominent and outspoken universalist, as were his contemporaries Theophilus of Antioch and Clement of Alexandria. A nascent belief in infernalism and eternal torment remained confined to heretical Gnostic sects, primarily those of Valentinus and Tatian. As we shall see in the next post, infernalism only spread to some orthodox communities in the third century, and even then remained a fringe belief.

What measures should the federation have taken to stop changeling infiltration?,"My ideas:

1) Medical officers are the highest priority as they can fake medical tests. They should have at least two guards at all time. If possible it should be performed/supervised by two or three other doctors.

2) In addition to blood tests (especially when they aren't available) passwords should be used when all humanoids are together in a group. These should be reset everytime the crew regroups. This should be done after perform a phaser sweep of the most secure area in the ship.

3) If the Changelings are smart they'll send in one person to do the mission/sabotage and another person to act like a regular crew member. That way if the Federation captures one they'll assume the threat  is over. Keep that in mind and remember :

max number of changelings &lt; the number required to over power the federation crew/forces or finish their mission

4) Give out different sets of false Intel to rule out which person is leaking the intel. On that note it might be worth allowing one changeling to operate just you can use it to feed false Intel to the dominion.

5) If you run into of the same people just stun both (unless they perform some function which is absolutely vital for the ship).

6) If possible post three guards at anything that could be castrophic if sabatoged. Select guards and sweep patrols randomly by lots. 

7) Security cameras are your best friend. 

8) Because it's not outside the realm of possibility that changelings will frame crew members always imprison instead of kill. And for god sakes don't rely just on force fields which go out with the power.

9) Booby traps on sensitive areas like the engine room.

10) Permission to suspend the chain of command upon certain criteria regarding high ranking officers exhibiting suspicious behavior.",DaystromInstitute,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/srsxyi/what_measures_should_the_federation_have_taken_to/,,catxxxxxxxx1313,srsxyi,/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/srsxyi/what_measures_should_the_federation_have_taken_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/srsxyi/what_measures_should_the_federation_have_taken_to/,54,2022-02-13

Tips on the best way to play with multiple expansions,"Hello! I'm sure this has been answered in some way on here, but I couldn't find it. I am pretty new to Dominion and got pretty excited about it quickly. After playing the base game a few times, I ended up buying Prosperity, Renaissance, Empires, and Adventures. Now that I have all of these expansions, I'm a little unsure about the best way to play. My friends and I have just been following the pre-build deck ideas on the back of the rules so far, but what's the recommended way to generally play with multiple expansions?

&amp;#x200B;

1. How do you set up a game? Do you randomize the 10 decks across all expansions combining all of their randomizer cards or do you stick to a certain amount of expansions/base? 
2. How do you include the additional cards such as Events, Projects, etc.? Do you include them all or just certain ones?

Winners and Losers of College Football Realignment!,"Winner: Sun Belt Conference 

The Sun Belt Conference was once the worst CFB conference until now when they acquired Marshall, Southern Mississippi &amp; Old Dominion from the C-USA and FCS power James Madison to get to 14 schools which only boosted their football power along side Coastal Carolina and App State




Winner: Texas, Oklahoma and the SEC


This is really self explanatory they went to the SEC, got more money and now we have A&amp;M-Texas back 




Winner: Cincinnati, BYU, Houston and UCF


The Big 12 is definitely a winner and loser in all of this by losing two marquee programs but their new additions are definitely winners especially BYU and Cincinnati who now don’t have to go undefeated to make the Playoff



Loser: C-USA

What was once a premiere conference is now a 9 team league with New Mexico State and FIU as members they’re using to survive.



Loser: Middle Tennessee State and Western Kentucky



These two great programs missed out on leaving the unstable C-USA and going to the MAC but Middle Tennessee decided not to go so WKU stayed as well.



Loser: the rest of the Power 5


The Big Ten, ACC, and PAC 12 decided to say no to expansion and instead they stayed put and this may not work in the end 



Loser: Massachusetts 


Just go back to the FCS already! No conference is going to take you!



Loser: AAC (C-USA 2.0)

A conference which once had Memphis, Cincinnati, UCF and Houston now lost those programs and had to raid C-USA with Charlotte, FAU, Rice, UTSA, UNT and UAB





Conferences are fucked up now…",CFB,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/srsr82/winners_and_losers_of_college_football_realignment/,Casual,WDBsports,srsr82,/r/CFB/comments/srsr82/winners_and_losers_of_college_football_realignment/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/srsr82/winners_and_losers_of_college_football_realignment/,67,2022-02-13

Beasts at the Gate (M4F),"For nearly one hundred years the southern gates have held, the ultimate barrier of stone and magic seperating the Northern Provinces, from the Southern Wastes. The wall and it's defenders have fought back the beastial hordes again and again, the tide of mutant creatures and horrifying nightmares kept at bay... until now.

The Gates have fallen, the defenders devoured or worse. The lands that have not known war in two generations have grown complacent. They are unprepared, unaware, and horribly ripe in the eyes of the beastmen now flooding northward. They have come to claim dominion over those who stand before them, to rule as brutal lords over their northern neighbors... Or at least pillage the countryside and breed their way through every female they come across.

Yes, it's fairly generic, but I'm a fan of the classics. Cliches exist for a reason, and this one is one my favorites. We have a plethora of beastmen to choose from, and any number of unfortunate young women who fall into their clutches. 

Looking for a focus on breeding/impreg, they're beastmen afterall, their number one instinct is to get the next generation going. I'm fairly open on kinks, just the ""normal"" limits most of us have: scat, snuff, futa, (sexual) gore, m/m. The usual.
I'm very open to suggestions, and ideas, and have no problem going short term or long term. Wanna get crazy? Let's get crazy, I'll at least consider most plots or scenarios. On the off chance someone wants to play a monstergirl, I am very much open to that as well.

Hope to hear from some of you soon.

The Parable of Creation (II) by Dr. Juan M. Flavier,"The allocation of natural resources under the dominion of mankind had been completed, God was pleased with the results.

The  people of the world were equally gratified at the bounty of God's  blessings. All the resources needed were in place: plants on land and  fishes in the sea, birds in the air, and the proper climate spread  across the globe.

Man's spokesman  stood up and addressed God. ""In the name of the people of the world, we  thank you most sincerely. You have provided for our needs now and for  the long future. We pray for guidance that we may be good stewards of  these treasures.""

God nodded his head knowingly.

A  second speaker rose and declared, ""God, we truly thank you for all your  blessings. But while you are at it, could you please give each country a  good government? This way, we can be ruled with justice, equity, and  decency.""

God was composed and did not look surprised. In fact, He looked as if He had expected the special request.

Then  He spoke. ""Resources, I can give you. But a good government? Ah, that  you have to evolve yourself. A good government is not a gift from God.  It is an achievement of the people.""",HavenOfLostSouls,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HavenOfLostSouls/comments/sr611p/the_parable_of_creation_ii_by_dr_juan_m_flavier/,,leiramfay,sr611p,/r/HavenOfLostSouls/comments/sr611p/the_parable_of_creation_ii_by_dr_juan_m_flavier/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HavenOfLostSouls/comments/sr611p/the_parable_of_creation_ii_by_dr_juan_m_flavier/,0,2022-02-13

Talos kinda ruined everything?,"Does anyone else feel this way? With him going to to Summerset and provoking an entire group of elves who loathe creation entirely. I'm not saying everything in-between is his fault, but like 85%. I mean if he had just left everything alone, every conflict on Tamriel would have just corrected itself. Every culture on Tamriel was either pretty isolated or just didn't like each other. Other than certain Dunmer houses enslaving Argonians, it just feels like he ruined everyone and everything. I'm sure the Altmer were than willing to stay on their little island and be pompous assholes but isolationist pompous assholes? After Ayrenn failed to bring Tamriel under her Aldmeri Dominion, I feel like the rest of Summerset said they were just going to focus on Alaxon. I'm also sure the Aldmeri Dominion wouldn't have given a damn about exterminating races of men had Tiber not brought a fantasy gundem mech and killed thousands of pompous but innocent elves.",ElderScrolls,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/sra36n/talos_kinda_ruined_everything/,,Consistent-Data5505,sra36n,/r/ElderScrolls/comments/sra36n/talos_kinda_ruined_everything/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/sra36n/talos_kinda_ruined_everything/,7,2022-02-13

Hollywood nostalgia baiting of old franchises is AWESOME,"After the release of Spiderman NWH, and now with The Flash bringing back Keaton Batman and Jurassic World bringing back the original trio, I’ve seen a lot of people complaining about how we never get exciting new movies anymore and all of it is a nostalgia bait for money. Personally, it’s absolutely working for me. The incredible excitement I got seeing Tobey and Andrew back for NWH, and likely will get for both The Flash and Jurassic World Dominion, is absolutely worth paying for. Nostalgia’s an awesome feeling, and I am all for Hollywood bringing back my favorite characters from old franchises for another appearance in a new sequel.

So in his time as president he created an Internet Kill Switch which can also be activated by the CDC. This internet kill switch could/would be used in a time of a Pandemic. A time when the Public would start to resist the narration of the CDC, NIH, NIAIH, Presidential Administration that would be connected to an outbreak that would cause a Pandemic. Obama knew that the free flow of information through internet networks could break the Narrative of a Fake/ false pandemic and the only way to keep the narrative/ fear mongering going was to shut down the internet!!! Replace with martial law and complete control through only DS news media that could control all air waves and satellites) (Trump created The Space Forces Intelligence Agency to counter these moves MiL. Ops will take place within those dark days.)“

* “Hospitals all over the world are being Cyber Attacked. They are shutting down Elective Surgeries &amp; other treatments ie Cancer Treatments. Med Beds on the way. Old Treatments are obsolete, just like POTUS said.”

* “Australia: the corrupt police force in Australia’s capital, Canberra, are deploying a signal interrupter to disturb any transmission of live footage of the protests. Also these can be used as frequency weapons, producing the Havana effect, making people very ill and if kept on too long, permanent brain damage. It is very real and needs to be smashed down.”

* A lengthy timeline that shows that the Khazarians (an Ashkanazic Jewish cabal), sometimes in collusion with the Rothschilds, created or helped create ISIS (in 1855, they merged with Skull and Bones in 1861), Big Pharma (1870), the sinking of the Titanic (to kill opposers to the Federal Reserve, which then then set up), the Bolshevik Revolution, the state of Israel, the CIA, the Mossad, and McDonalds.

* “A major leak has surfaced exposing 1.95 Million Chinese Communist Party members &amp; 79,000 branches were embedded in US Government agencies.” [Who leaked it? Joseph McCarthy via Ouija Board?]

Ranked duels is a whole 'nother beast of its own!,"I have been playing for a little bit now, Rep 5, nothing crazy. I can hold my own in different game types; Breach, Dominion, and regular duels, and even thrive in them...but Ranked...hoooooly shit Ranked...I have never been parried, fainted, or dodged as much as ranked. I feel violated after some of these bouts.  If you are well Ranked, I fckin salute you!

I will say though, I like the high fashion loot you can get lol. But really, the dozen or so matches I played today, really taught me how to duel better...a little better.

"[H] Necron Boxes [W] $$$, Adeptus Custodes Boxes [Loc] St Louis, MO, USA","Hey folks! 

[I have an entire army's worth of Necrons all new in box - ](https://i.imgur.com/MfodQS1.jpg) they all are completely untouched and would be exactly what you find on store shelves. I have collected them for a while now but ultimately decided I want to go with Custodes instead. 

**I am hoping to sell this full set for $900 USD.** The set is valued at $1100+, so the bundle is over 15% cheaper than market price! I'd be willing to go a bit lower for some unopened Custodes Boxes, so please let me know in PMs if you're interested in trading those. While I strongly prefer selling in one large bundle, I can potentially sell individually based on the prices below.

This is the full list of boxes and what I got each item for. Note this includes any sales I purchased them on, so you'll likely get them cheaper than directly through GW! All prices are in USD.

This game is set in Blizzard’s StarCraft universe at the beginning of Starcraft II and played using the Genesys Roleplaying System. The PCs started as investigators within the chronically underfunded, under-equipped, understaffed, and possibly underhanded FRAWD, the Dominion's Fraud, Retaliation, Abuse, and Waste Division. Join Lex, playing resocialized soldier Lilly Washington; Jenn, playing latent psionic Imogen Owendoher from the Umojan protectorate; and Dan, our game master. Explore the lore of the StarCraft universe alongside players new to it themselves, under the guidance of a GM who has played the video games.

We release a new [StarCraft FRAWD Investigators](https://diceystories.com/starcraft-frawd-investigators/) episode at the start of each week, and the audio is accompanied by a serialized write-up of the adventure on our website.

Kocka7 220214,"​- Június közepén érkezik a *Toy Story* filmek Buzz Lightyear figuráit ihlető eredeti hős, **Lightyear** történetének animációs filmje, ehhez jött most egy [bemutató előzetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwZs3H_UN3k).

- A *Moonfall* c. katasztrófafilm (vagy katasztrófa film?) apropóján a Kurzgesagt csatorna tudományos alapokon (és némi mágiát is bevetve) [szimulálta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lheapd7bgLA), mi történne, ha a Hold letérne a pályájáról és egy év alatt a Föld közelébe kerülne.

- Múlt héten volt bejelentve a **Bastard!** heavy metal dark fantasy anime remake, már kaptunk is egy [rövid előzetest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4zSf3CfRA) hozzá.

- Júniusban érkezik a mozikba a **Jurassic World Dominion**, ami a [friss előzetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb5ELWi-ekk) alapján minden szereplőt visszahoz a Jurassic Park és Jurassic World filmekből.

  Nem tudom, kell-e ez most, vagy sem, mindenesetre meg fogom nézni (bár a JP3-mat azt hiszem, már nem láttam, de a többi részt igen).

- Véget ért a **The Book of Boba Fett** sorozat első (és lehet, hogy egyetlen?) évada. Összességében tetszett, bár az első négy rész eléggé hullámzott itt-ott, csak az ötödik résztől Din (és persze Luke, meg Grogu) felbukkanása fordította meg a trendet, az utolsó rész még kifejezetten epic volt. A Disney most nem az utolsó rész végére fűzte be a folytatást (bár egy rejtett jelenet most is volt), hanem egy nappal később jelentette be, hogy a következő Star Wars tévésorozat, az **Obi-Wan Kenobi** május 25-én érkezik. Az előzetes információk alapján tudni lehet, hogy időben visszamegyünk az Episode 3 eseményei utánra, amikor Kenobi magányos remeteként éldegélt a Tatooine-on, a felcseperedő Luke közelében (vajon látni fogjuk-e a kis Luke-ot, mint ahogy Anakint láttuk az első filmben?), és azt is tudni lehet, hogy Hayden Christensen visszatér majd Vader szerepében, bár nem tudni, hogy csak valami cameo képében, vagy tényleges szerepe is lesz a történetben (eddig úgy tudtuk, hogy az Ep3 vége és az Episode 4 hangár jelenete között nem találkoztak, de nem lehetetlen, hogy ezt is újraírják valamelyest).

  Bízom még abban is, hogy Grogu sztorija valahogy vissza fog köszönni itt is. Eddig mindhárom sorozatban voltak visszautalások a múltra, amik az ő személye körül forogtak, nem tartom elképzelhetetlennek, hogy talán lesz jelenet a Jedi templomból, ahol találkozhattak, esetleg Kenobinak valami szerepe is lehetett a megmenekülésében. Van egy olyan érzésem, hogy az érkező *Ahsoka* sorozat, és a *Mando* S3 (ha lesz, bár muszáj, hogy legyen), és talán az *Andor* is csatlakozik majd ehhez a trendhez, és az egész egy új filmre, vagy hasonlóra fog kifutni, amelyben Thrawn felbukkanása lesz a központi téma.

- A Hulu [feltámasztja](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/futurama-revival-hulu-1235176203/) a **Futurama** animációs sorozatot, és 20 részt rendelt be.

  Huhh, meg kellene már néznem ezt is, eléggé leragadtam valahol a második évad közepénél, pedig tetszett.

- Lement a Super Bowl, sok új előzetessel lettünk gazdagabbak - és néhány álommal szegényebbek. A **The Rings of Power** például nagyon szépnek, de üresnek [ígérkezik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7v1hIkYH24) - és hol vannakl a szereplők? Csak csupa fiatalt látok, ez akkor most egy YA sorozat lesz? Jordan Peele [új filmje](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In8fuzj3gck), a **NOPE** számomra... nope, az agyonajnározott *Get Out*-on kétszeri nekifutásra sem tudtam átverekedni magam.

- 75 éves korában [elhunyt](https://hu.ign.com/ivan-reitman/74606/news/75-eves-koraban-elhunyt-ivan-reitman-a-szellemirtok-az-ikrek-az-ovizsaru-es-meg-megannyi-klasszikus) Ivan Reitman, a *Szellemírtók*, az *Ovizsaru*, az *Ikrek*, és más ismert filmek rendezője.

- *Ocean's Eleven* és *Firefly* ihletésű sci-fi szerepjáték Kickstartere [indul hamarosan](https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/freelancers-guide/news/freelancers-guide-rpg-ks) **Freelancer's Guide** címmel. A játék a mostani 5E dömpingtől eltérően egy újszerű kártyás rendszerre épül majd.

- A *City of Mist*et jegyző Son of Oak játékstúdió is új kiberpunk szerepjátékot [tervez](https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/otherword/news/otherworld-rpg-city-of-mist-kickstarter) a COM rendszerére alapozva és azt felújítva **:Otherworld** címmel (a “:” nem elírás, ez van a hivatalos címében, hogy biztosan ne lehessen rákeresni majd, és hogy tutira összekeverhető legyen a nagyon hasonló nevű *Other Worlds* és *Otherworlds* szerepjátékokkal...).

- Lejárt a **Steam Deck** hardver hírembargója, itt egy elég alapos [unboxing videó](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UB9XoPlJ0U), itt meg egy részletekbe menő [hardware review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjZ4POvk14c). A szoftveres embargó végére február végéig, a kézikonzol megjelenéséig várnunk kell, de a Valve már elkezdte jelölgetni a bevizsgált és kompatibilis [játékok listáját](https://steamdb.info/search/?a=app_keynames&amp;type=-1&amp;keyname=530&amp;operator=1&amp;keyvalue=SteamDeckVerified) (ez a SteamDB-n át bejelentkezve látható egyelőre, de a [ProtonDB kezdőlapján](https://www.protondb.com/) login nélkül is elérhető).

- Több évnyi várakozás után pénteken [megjelent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwnk9XrhN54) a **Lost Ark** című, dél-koreai fantasy MMORPG. A játék a megjelenés napján áttörte az egymillió játékosi határt a Steamen, és hosszú várakozási sorok alakultak ki.",PeteRPG,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeteRPG/comments/ssezb7/kocka7_220214/,hírek,zistenz,ssezb7,/r/PeteRPG/comments/ssezb7/kocka7_220214/,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeteRPG/comments/ssezb7/kocka7_220214/,0,2022-02-14

[Online][5e] Against the Giants - Long Term Campaign - Saturday 11pm to 4am EST,"#  Hello Adventurers, welcome to the continent of Myria!

We have 4 players and are looking for 1 more to join the team!! The group is currently level 12 and will be starting the 6th chapter of the yawning portal called (Against The Giants).

**Time:** We play every Saturday 11:00pm-4:00am eastern time. The more flexible your schedule for late night games the better!! We plan on doing every chapter of the yawning portal campaign. The campaign will run for at least a year if not longer. Only players who are able to commit to a long term campaign will be considered.

**Location:** We are playing on roll20. The game includes music, high quality maps, 2500+ custom made tokens etc. We will be talking in discord (a mic is needed).

**Restrictions:** We are looking for players 18+. The game is usually around 50% combat and 50% RP. No Chaotic evil, anti party members or Insane characters. Combat feats are not allowed (Roleplaying feats are encouraged). No flying. No Optional Tashas. Player romances have to be agreed to beforehand by both parties. Intimate scenes fade to black.

**Group Composition:** Life cleric (Healer), Wizard, Monk, Sorceress.

**Game type:** Homebrew. We follow most rules in the book but will be flexible with some in order to create a better experience for the players. Creatures, lore, side quests, main story line is all homebrew and custom made. All character back stories are important and will affect the overall story. Every major decision, success or failure of the players will influence the story. I spend an average of 20-30 hours a week updating and creating the game.

\-Yawning portal campaign with a homebrew main story.

\-Lore heavy world-Fun and Unique fight mechanics (Boss actions, lair mechanics, using the environment) with multiple ways to handle each encounter. Winning or failing missions will impact the overall story! Your choices matter!!!

\-Resource gathering on maps and item crafting (potions, poisons, armor etc).

\-Sanity system for those ""holy shit moments""

\-2500+ Custom made NPCs and 250+ high quality homebrew maps.

\-Animated high quality Spells that can be placed on the map.

\-Epic Music for combat, ambiance and perception cues.

\-Your character's background matters and will be a main focus in the game!

\-Game Recaps are written in discord and we do a debrief at the beginning of every game. We also have chapter recaps for new players so you can jump right in and be caught up.

\-Personal character pages on discord for your use.-Special holiday quests (Christmas, Halloween etc). We also do background flashback quests and also Goblin squad quests where players get to goof off as goblins on crazy missions lol.

\-Custom made inspiration deck that can be used at any time. Inspiration cards are given to players who do something cool in game or make people laugh in discord.

\-Combat, status and concentration mods on roll20 to help players play turns faster.-Lots of homebrew riddles, puzzles and intro pages to hint at what's coming next.

\-Dynamic lighting (this means that spells, torches, campfires etc give off light) and you can only see what your character can see.-A DM that never cancels games!

**Setting:** The campaign is 5e and called the Yawning portal campaign. We have weaved every dungeon of the campaign into an overall homebrew story which is heavily impacted by the player's choices and backgrounds.

**Story:** The group is currently trying to unravel the mystery behind the Zentharim who are actively kidnaping and infecting prominent members of society with brain slugs.

The group is currently trying to unravel the mystery behind an unknown faction who are actively kidnapping and infecting prominent members of society with brain slugs.

The Dominion empire has declared war on The Great Iron Fist empire as retaliation for harvesting their sacred living trees during their most important religious ceremony called the Uroboros Festival. The Hyperian Empire to the north have closed their borders after the group publicly unveiled a plot by the league of assassins to infect and control prominent members of society with brain slugs. Meanwhile, a horde of undead is currently growing by the day, pillaging and harvesting bodies throughout it's empire. The Paladins of Tyr are splintered into two factions after the representative of the green cloaks separated from the church after their council member was caught committing heinous war crimes. Orcs have been seen crossing the impassable mountains and scouting the 3 major kingdoms, an imminent invasion is expected. If you have read this far, write the words ""mixman is the best goblin"" in your application message in order to be considered.

"An Attempt to Translate Case Files, Part 4 of Chapter 3, Book 7"," Hi! This is a fan-translated part 4 of chapter 3 of the Contract of Atlas (Lower) from the light novel series The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II. All the important stuff has been said in my first post, pinned on my profile along with some links to the places where they are compiled. I don’t own any of the rights to the original work, the translation quality isn’t great, but I hope you enjoy! 

**If you didn’t read the earlier parts, you will be confused**.

Chapter 3, Part 4:

We ran down the mountain after my mentor, and were about to reach the swamp.

Trimmau cut through the dense shrubbery in front of us, creating a path. I suppose that was the most fitting job for her, considering that she didn’t get tired. Though my mentor was usually the first person to collapse from exhaustion, this time, he tried his best to endure, and continued walking down the steep slope.

The knight (Sir Kay) guarded our rear, and I stayed close to my mentor. Add still remained as a scythe in my hands, and showed no sign of waking up. Realizing this, I bit my lip. 

At that moment, my mentor spoke.

“Is it really a good idea to just face the villagers like this?”

“…I think we can do it.”

“Your mother might be there.”

“…It’s okay, I know.”  
 

I nodded twice.

The shock that came from knowing that they launched an all-out search of the mountain was temporary, because from the moment we became enemies of the village, I understood that I would have to confront my mother.

“Let’s not talk about that now. What did you find out just then? What has Heartless been doing here?”

“Though I have a basic understanding of what’s written on the evidence board, I only have hypotheses about what exactly he was planning. I do have a theory about what he was doing before the incident, though.”

“Before the incident?”

“It’s something that happened during the First Cycle. Bersac told me that on the first day, someone broke multiple rules.”

I recalled what Reines had told me.

After they talked to Zepia, Bersac had said something, and asked them if they knew something about it.

—“When children play outside, sometimes the rules get broken. …But this time, two rules were broken.”

“It was actually caused by Heartless approaching the village at night, possibly to make final preparations or something along those lines. After that, he \[left straight away\], without praying to the Black Madonna.”

“He… left…”

True, this way, two rules would be broken, the one about going out at night, and the one about praying to the Black Madonna.

“Then what about when he came?”

“That hut was built on the other end of the swamp. It’s probably outside the detection range of the magecraft. He might still have broken the rules, though. Bersac said that some rules would be broken once in a while, such as the one about going out at night. I suppose he doesn’t care that much about them, anyway.”

That was a reasonable statement.

But if that was the case, how long had Heartless secretly been in this village? How much time had he spent, staying just outside of the village and spying on us?

“……”

An eerie feeling coiled up at the bottom of my heart.

It was a different type of raw disgust to the one I had felt when I had been told of the secret of this village.

It made me feel as if I had been watched by the gaze of an insect instead of a human. We had only ever met once, on the Rail Zeppelin, but that encounter alone was enough for me to discern something inhuman about that man. What did it mean, then, if that kind of person had watched me for a long period of time?

“Heartless never really involves himself in cases,” my mentor analyzed. “Other than when he provided funds in the case at the Twin Towers of Ilsema, he’s probably also related to many other incidents. Most of them are heavily covered up, though. If he didn’t do so, he’d end up getting targeted by something.”

After saying that much, he paused for a few seconds before he continued to speak.

“I was the one who happened to put an end to that.”

“Huh.” This time, it was the knight who cooperated by responding. “I see. So that’s why the evidence board or whatever it’s called is there. Understandable. That means that the turning point of this case was…”

In response to the knight’s somewhat cheerful words, my mentor nodded sternly.

“Yes, it was me.”

“Why would it be you?”(*TN: Gray says this.*)

“Think about why the Holy Church would choose to act now. Since a Lord of the Clock Tower has come to visit, I don’t think it would continue to idly stand by. At least, Heartless believed that was the case. That’s why he left.”

“……”

I clenched my fists.

This was only logical. My mentor was at least still one of only twelve Lords of the Clock Tower, and his every move had to be watched. Something like a Lord visiting the village they were watching over as the Fifth Holy Grail War and the revival of King Arthur loomed just over the horizon couldn’t just be dismissed as a coincidence.

Even though it was such a natural conclusion, I had overlooked it.

“Heartless probably never anticipated that I would come to the village. Yes, it’s incredibly unexpected that one of the twelve Lords would recklessly visit this village. Even if he isn’t behind everything, he plays a role in this case.”

“We will be there soon,” the mercury maid said softly.

Just as she said, the forest immediately broke away to reveal flat land.

The light of the rising sun gently pricked my eyes.

The swamp was right in front of us.

Though I’d gotten close to this place before, now that I was right in front of it, I thought that it was a bit too big for a swamp (*TN: When since did swamps have a size limit?*). Though the waters were muddy now, it might have been clearer in the past.

Gradually, the beams of sunlight expanded their dominion, creeping slowly across the mountain slopes. However, I could not appreciate this breathtaking sight.

Dawn was breaking.

That meant—

“It’s almost time for you to die. No, it’s almost the time you died in the past(*TN: Aaa this used to be so concise and logical*),” my mentor said.

How inconsiderate. He spoke as if it was his duty to speak the truth whenever he saw it. That was probably why so many mages hated him. Because the veil of mystery that concealed the truth was an indispensable wall of defense that protected magecraft.

“Therefore, it definitely won’t deviate from this timeline.” 

He uttered those words as he stared toward the swamp.

—And then.

As if that was a prophecy, something appeared.

A giant shadow tore through the mud and rose from the surface of the water.

It was much larger than a person.

A familiar building emerged from the water. No, it wasn’t just familiar. Actually, it was something that I had seen mere hours ago. The most unforgettable thing was the statue near the entrance that was now illuminated by the morning light. One half of the temple rose through the water and joined with the other half, as if they were forming a bridge.

“\[That temple\]… has come up from the water…?” I mumbled in confusion as I saw the sight which I could never have dreamed up of.

Yes.

Rising in the thin mist of the dawn was, indeed, the underground temple we had found before we fought with the Husk King.

Of course, according to the laws of physics, the stone structure and the foundations supporting it could never have risen from the swamp. This was undoubtedly the result of mystery, of a scale that was beyond the reach of modern mages. 

“…Ah, damn it, is that what it is? Those idiot mages really care about this kind of crap” the knight said beside me. 

The flippant attitude from before had disappeared completely. The knight of the round table gritted his teeth. 

“That’s… Avalon…!”

\*

“W-what is that!? Where’d it come from? How’d it get up here?”

The voice was more like that of a child getting excited over a new toy than someone who was genuinely surprised.

“Didn’t you say that the structure was unnatural?” Zepia replied in a calm voice.

Indeed, Flat, who had been in charge of adjusting the parameters, had said that when the flood happened.

—“The structure of that place is pretty unnatural anyway… Let me think, that means that we can use this method to mess with this place that looks like the past, right?”

It was the reason why it was relatively easy for Flat to intervene, and how Zepia accepted their success.

These two things originated from the same place. In other words, the reason why Flat was able to cause a flood was that there was already such a structure underground.

“In order to raise it, there’s actually a sequence that needs to be followed. I actually had to spend quite a bit of effort to skip all of that. The program to dispel the Bounded Field at the same time the temple started rising seems to have run perfectly.”

In response to Zepia’s words, Flat looked up.

“…So, you’re saying that you completely countered my attack by turning my intervention against me?”

“Hm,” Zepia said. His eyelashes fluttered. “That isn’t the area your instructor specializes in, so I don’t suppose he ever taught about you this. Intervention through magecraft contains techniques from all sorts of systems. Simply using regular Circuits in an unorthodox way isn’t an ability. Though it doesn’t happen very often, when a mage meets a hacker, there are some techniques that are commonly used.”

The finger of the alchemist seemed to be striking on the keys of an invisible keyboard.

Every action that he made seemed to play on a magical note in the world which resembled the past that Lord El-Melloi II was currently within. Perhaps it was these notes, which were inaudible to the human ear, was rocking the foundations of the world itself.

“For me, this is a rare, golden opportunity for me to showcase the abilities which I have long forgotten about.”

There was a detectable amount of pride and confidence in Zepia’s words.

“Ahaha! That’s awesome! I didn’t know that magecraft could be used that way! The Atlas Institute’s really full of mysteries, like a collectible card game that’s been out for a couple decades!”

“Can you calm down for a bit?” Svin warned his classmate, as he stared intently at the crystal ball. In its reflection, their beloved lecturer of the Clock Tower faced the rising tower.

“Let’s see,” Zepia said, turning to look at the crystal ball once more. “Can you arrive at the mystery you are to solve, Lord El-Melloi II?”

"Some Short Story Thoughts: Kissing Carrion, The Cutting Room, Final Cuts","Hi, I’m talking about more short stories. You probably know the drill by now. I read short story collections/anthologies, I post some thoughts on them, some folks on horrorlit enjoy my posts about them. Here are some thoughts on some stuff I’ve read lately.

***Kissing Carrion*** **by Gemma Files**

I’ve read several of Gemma Files’ short stories before and really enjoyed a lot of them, but this is my first time diving into her stuff outside of anthologies she appeared in. *Kissing Carrion* is her first collection (originally published in 2003), and I’m excited to crack into it. The back-of-the-book blurb mentions a story involving necrophilia right off the bat, so I’m expecting this to get real dark and I am looking forward to it. Strap in for dark subject matter and sexual content, everyone.

* “Kissing Carrion” – Yep, necrophilia right off the bat. It’s that kind of book, folks! Consider this story a content warning for sexual stuff throughout the entire collection. We follow a twisted business partnership between a necrophile and a woman who developed a machine that allows her to puppeteer corpses. The two of them perform live sex shows together. I’m sure you can fill in the details yourself. Problem is, their partnership is slowly deteriorating thanks to behind-the-scenes drama. Also, the entire story is narrated from the point of view of the also-deteriorating corpse they’ve been using lately for the shows. It’s a damn good story that combines sleaze and deeply uncomfortable sex with afterlife mysticism and that contrast works incredibly well.

* “Keepsake” – A story about a woman trying to take care of her deeply ill brother. The blood-drinking kind of ill. Just a real solid vampire story with a lot of great 90s goth vibes. Not really much more to say about it without getting into spoilers surrounding a really fucked up twist, but it’s a good one.

* “Rose-Sick” – A horror erotica story about a man who goes home with someone supernatural in the wake of a break-up. Asphyxiation kink ensues. I can’t get into much detail without spoiling it, but Files uses really evocative prose and a bit of background worldbuilding to create something a lot more interesting than your typical sex with a paranormal entity story. The fact that the whole thing is told in second person perspective puts you as the reader maybe a little bit closer to the whole torrid affair than is comfortable. Loved this one.

* “Blood Makes Noise” – Man, nothing puts me in a state of sheer unadulterated primal goddamn panic like underwater horror. Thanks, Gemma Files! Anyways, this story is about a submarine stranded and dying at the bottom of the ocean, narrated by one of the only survivors in an effort to make sense of everything that happened, including him betraying the crew and some experiments involving a disturbing fossil that a rogue doctor found. It’s some pretty good deep sea cosmic horror, so if that’s your thing, give it a look.

* “Skeleton Bitch” – A goth rocker begins to develop an obsession with a girl he meets backstage at a venue, and it ends up unraveling him in the worst ways. The erotic elements and horror play off each other in ways that become disturbing once the reveal happens, and good lord is it a reveal to remember. It’s incredible. Also, “Skeleton Bitch” is just a really fun title to say.

* “Folly” – I’ve read a few of Gemma Files’ haunted house stories before, and they always leave an impact. This one is no exception. The narration takes the form of a haunted house ghost tour guide’s spiel, and as we learn more of the house’s dark history and strange architecture, it quickly becomes clear that there’s something deeply wrong going on. I’ve noticed that the tendency with the Files haunted house stories that I’ve read seems to be that the ghosts themselves take the backseat, and the architecture and behavior of the building itself provides the true horror. It’s always really memorable. This one is just a real good scary house story.

* “Mouthful of Pins” – When they were young, a group of children who bonded over their experiences of abuse invented a dark fantasy world and terrifying monsters to rule it. Now they’re grown up, and their fantasy world is looking for them. I’ve mentioned before that horror fantasy can be very hit or miss for me, but this one really works in the best ways. The hints we get of what was in the fantasy world are just enough to provide hints at the terror without going into explicit detail, and I really wish I could know more about the mythos these kids created. Damn good.

* “Pretend That We’re Dead” – Toronto is haunted. Something happened, and now the entire city is infested with surreal-looking ghosts, most notably during a weekly event when they form a procession and march down one street in particular. With this as the background, we get the life story of a girl who’s part of the goth subculture of people born right around the time the infestation started. It’s grim as hell, and the story highlights tragedy, depression, and alienation in hard-hitting ways with some great imagery from Toronto’s ghosts. As a side note, I’m now wondering if the imagery of ghosts forming a parade acted as inspiration for a certain legendary goth rock opera. *When I was/A young boy...*

* “No Darkness But Ours” – An encounter between a family on a roadtrip and a strange and unsettling girl wandering the countryside. Most of this story didn’t really land for me, but I did like the disturbing hints given for the wanderer’s history and how it turned her into what she is now.

* “Job 37” – An interview between paranormal researchers and the head of a cleanup crew that deals with dead bodies about something disturbing the team encountered on a job. The buildup involves all the gruesome details of cleaning up decaying corpses, and when we finally get the reveal, the lack of gore and viscera makes it all the more horrific.

* “Bear-Shirt” – A gay man who used to be in a relationship with a neonazi with an unhealthy interest in Viking mysticism reflects on their time together as he is drawn back to a cabin in the woods where they spent time together. Most of the story is focused on building up the dynamics between the two characters, but when the supernatural finally enters the picture, it’s striking.

* “Hidebound” – A security guard starts noticing some odd types around the building she’s keeping an eye on, and things start to go bad very quickly. The most gruesome details are left in the background, and the abandoned-building-at-nighttime really works as a setting that builds up the tension. It’s pretty good!

* “Skin City” – The story of a man trying to track down an old friend, who accidentally summoned something dark years ago and is now doing terrible things that involve flaying a whole bunch of people. A really great little noir horror story with some really gruesome gore and body horror.

* “Seen” – A story written as a short film screenplay, involving two detectives trying to solve the murder of an entire family. It’s pretty good and I liked the supernatural implications, but it ends just as it really starts to get going. I kind of wish there was an expanded version of it.

* “Torch Song” – When an ex-cop finds out his former partner is investigating some disturbing murders, it turns out that they might be linked back to an old case involving a love cult that they worked together years ago. That case ended with one party doing something monstrous to the other, so things aren’t great between the two of them. An unsettling, gritty crime horror story where the aftermath of a case is as horrific as the case itself.

* “The Diarist” – Journal entries from someone who is taking a breakup very badly. Don’t have much to say about this one. “Interior monologue from a stalker” stories don’t always work for me, but this one had a ritualistic occult angle that made it a lot more interesting.

* “Dead Bodies Possessed By Furious Motion” – One last vampire story to close it out. We follow Elder, a vampire who is sick and tired of the established rules and power structures of vampire society, and is making plans to find a new life for herself among the stars. This one’s got loads of goth vibes, blood-soaked sex (I will use the phrase “blood snowballing” and leave the rest up to your imaginations. Have fun with that imagery, fuckers!), and power struggles within vampire leadership. Great characters, a plot that gets real wild once we learn Elder’s plan, some laughs over the idea of the story’s distant future being the year 2020, just a damn good vamp story in general.

*Kissing Carrion* is a damn great collection, and if you’re looking for goth horror, erotic horror, or extreme horror of the 90s, it’s definitely one to check out. I don’t think I have much more to say that I haven’t already said. It’s real good, and I’m definitely looking forward to reading Files’ other collections in the future. 

Also, apparently a few stories from this collection were adapted as episodes of a Canadian vampire horror anthology TV series called *The Hunger*, so I might have to check that out. In Files’ afterword, she mentions that “Keepsake” was on the table for a potential adaptation, but every executive involved in the show immediately passed as soon as they read the &gt;!incestuous menstrual-blood-drinking vampire cunnilingus!&lt; scene. Can’t imagine why they didn’t want to put that on television. Anyways, if there’s anyone reading this who’s watched *The Hunger* before, let me know what you thought of Files’ episodes or the show in general.


***The Cutting Room*** **(Edited by Ellen Datlow)**

Not much to say about this one. I love movies. I love horror. I love horror about movies. Ellen Datlow is an incredible editor. All reasons I got interested in this one. I’ve read a couple stories in here before, but the majority of them are new to me. I’m very excited to read it.

* “The Cutter” by Edward Bryant – The story of a young movie theater employee and the theater’s owner, a strange man who edits his own versions of the movies before showing them. The owner has an unrequited crush on a local patron of the theater, and before the end, things turn bad. I was expecting the story to get a lot weirder and more supernatural, but it was a pretty decent story all the same. If you’re a fan of King-esque childhood nostalgia horror with kid protagonists, you’ll probably enjoy this one.

* “The Hanged Man of Oz” by Steve Nagy – A man learns about the urban legend of the suicide victim in the background of *The Wizard of Oz* from a movie nerd he’s dating, and as he becomes more obsessed, Oz starts to haunt him. Again, another story where what I expected was not what I got (*Candyman* and the likes have made me come to expect a lot of ruminations on the nature of fiction and reality when urban legends are brought up in horror), but it’s still a real solid tale with some creepy movie imagery.

* “Deadspace” by Dennis Etchison – A movie producer waits for a callback from a movie star in a nice hotel in California. Not too much of a plot here so this is going to be brief, but if you like unsettling vibes and surreal imagery and don’t mind a very slow plot, it’s a good one.

* “Cuts” by F. Paul Wilson – A movie director coming off of a recent bomb begins to experience a terrifying affliction that stems from bad blood between himself and the author whose book he adapted. This one had potential but it didn’t really land for me. The body horror aspects are great, but the villain’s motivation is pretty far-fetched, the supernatural elements weren’t really used to their full potential, and what seemed like an interesting dynamic between the hero and villain kind of fell apart in the final scene when the villain becomes downright cartoonish.

* “Final Girl Theory” by A.C. Wise – I talked about this one very briefly in my Best Horror of the Year posts. This one is the story of a disturbing old horror movie called *Kaleidoscope*, one with many open questions about its history and a cultlike hold on its fanbase. It’s also about a young man who meets an actress from it. This one’s so open-ended that it’ll probably be hit or miss for a lot of people, but it really works for me. The lurid descriptions of *Kaleidoscope*’s horrors combined with the ambiguity of what the movie actually is are incredibly striking, and those open-ended questions really highlight the idea of fear of the unknown. It’s just an incredible story and I’m going to be thinking about it for a very long time.

* “Lapland, or Film Noir” by Peter Straub – Peter Straub is a name I see frequently here on horrorlit, but I’ve never really read anything by him before. “Lapland” is a weird and experimental story and I’m not sure if I’d call it horror, but it’s real good. We learn about the populace and typical routines of a town in Florida (as a Floridian myself, I am legally required to say hell yeah baby Sunshine fuckin State fuck yeah let’s go) where everything plays out as a film noir. Most men are detectives, the women are all femme fatales who die young, and the weather is perpetually wet and rainy (OK, that last one is true of all of Florida, not much of a shock there). I had to give the ending a second read to really understand what was going on, but it’s pretty great once you get a handle on what it means. This probably is not at all representative of the rest of Straub’s works, but I enjoyed it.

* “The Thousand Cuts” by Ian Watson – A darkly comic apocalypse story about the world experiencing a phenomenon where reality is repeatedly jumping forward in time, with everyone on the planet skipping days and weeks with no memory of what happened in that period. Almost as if something or someone is editing reality like a film. While not really outright terrifying, it’s a pretty fun speculative fiction story with a really interesting concept. I enjoyed it. (Also, while reading it I had a sudden vision of myself as Bart Simpson at the chalkboard, writing “I Will Not Make *JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure* Jokes” over and over again. If you know, you know.)

* “Occam’s Ducks” by Howard Waldrop – Gonna be completely honest, most of this one just went over my head. We start with the mysterious temporary disappearance of D.W. Griffith and his film crew during a shoot at sea in Florida, then jump to strange events surrounding the filming of a remake of *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari* in the early 20th Century. Some interesting ideas but it never really added up for me. You might be able to make more sense of it than I did.

* “Dead Image” by David Morrell – Hey, holy shit, that’s the guy who wrote *First Blood* and created Rambo! “Dead Image” follows a screenwriter named David who makes an interesting discovery in the background of his current project: an extra named Wes who looks exactly like James ~~Dean~~ Deacon, an actor who could have had an incredible career but died tragically young. As David and Wes form a friendship and start working on bigger projects together, more and more unsettling similarities between Wes and Deacon start coming to light, and whatever these similarities mean, they spell trouble. The buildup of suspense is incredible, and the big reveal at the end is both horrific and tragic.

* “The Constantinople Archives” by Robert Shearman – Less horror, more speculative fiction. Told in the form of an academic essay, we learn some film history from the Byzantine Empire in a world where silent film technology was invented in the 1400s. It was an interesting idea for an alt history story, but not horror unless you want to really stretch.

* “each thing i show you is a piece of my death” by Gemma Files &amp; Stephen J. Barringer – I fucking love this story, so you might have seen me talk it up on horrorlit before now. It’s an epistolary horror story about a strange phenomenon where a naked man appears in the background of music videos, TV shows, and movies. Nobody has any idea who keeps editing this guy in or how it’s being done, but the story traces the origins back to disturbing footage sent anonymously to two experimental filmmakers in Canada. It’s a goddamn amazing story. The story gives just enough reveals that we get the implications of what is going on, but the biggest mysteries are still left open to make it even more unsettling. I cannot recommend this one enough.

* “Cinder Images” by Gary McMahon – Strange events in the aftermath of a screening of a disturbing war movie. I don’t really have much to say about this one beyond I enjoyed it. Some really gruesome war imagery here that really worked well.

* “The Pied Piper of Hammersmith” by Nicholas Royle – A pretty solid story about a train worker who is not entirely stable. Getting into more details would be spoiler-y and I had to give it a reread or two to actually understand what was going on, but I really liked the imagery of trains as movies.

* “Filming the Making of the Film of the Making of *Fitzcarraldo*” by Garry Kilworth – A film crew gets word about the production of Werner Herzog’s movie *Fitzcarrraldo*, and they head out to make a documentary about the how the movie was made. Unfortunately, there’s already a crew making a documentary about how *Fitzcarraldo* was made (it’s called *Burden of Dreams*), so the story’s fictional movie crew ends up making a documentary about the making of *Burden of Dreams*. And when they try to inject their own drama into the multiple film shoots, surrealist insanity begins to set in and things go to hell. The story plays with the idea of layers (of fiction, of filmmaking, of memory) in some interesting ways, although there was one bit that I think was mostly just for shock value that didn’t horrify in the same ways as the rest of the story (layers of incest, in this case). Despite that one flaw, I do think the story worked really well and I really enjoyed it.

* “Onlookers” by Gary A. Braunbeck – Boy, people sure do love a good “normal-looking person but with an inanimate object for a head” character design, huh? People with TVs for heads, people with flowers for heads, people with speakers or phones or planets for heads, it’s just a real fun bit of surreal character design that you see all over the damn place. Seriously, you have no idea how many millennial and gen Z artists on Twitter and Tumblr have surrealist object head OCs. René Magritte would be proud. Anyways. “Onlookers” has some really good creepy inanimate object head critters, and they’re appearing to a man who, as a boy, ended up wandering into the filming of Samuel Beckett’s short film *Film*, starring Buster Keaton. This one is a goddamn great cosmic horror story. Great imagery, some twists and turns that made my jaw drop, an incredible concept behind the whole plot, plenty of film theory discussion that I loved because I’m an insufferable nerd, just a wonderful story all the way through. Next time folks ask for movie horror recommendations, I’m definitely bringing this one up.

* “Recreation” by Lucy A. Snyder – This one is a poem, and a short one at that, so I don’t really have much to say at it. Neat imagery. I liked it.

* “Bright Lights, Big Zombie” by Douglas E. Winter – In the midst of the zombie apocalypse, you, the protagonist, are an employee for a horror movie magazine that’s slowly dying thanks to the American government going into a new Video Nasty moral panic and banning any movie with gore in it. The fact that you deal in an underground black market of horror movies means you’re in danger of getting on their bad side. Man, I did not expect this story to hit as hard as it did. There’s some standard zombie action near the end, but most of the story is focused on depicting a country in the midst of a slow, boring apocalypse, where the monotony of constant doom and despair hollows people out into shells of their former selves, while the forces of government lose their fucking minds over completely irrelevant things and take actions that help nobody. Given the current state of things, it resonated quite a fucking bit. Great story, but good god, it made me want to drink.

* “She Drives the Men to Crimes of Passion!” by Genevieve Valentine – A dark fantasy story about a director in the 30s who discovers a perfect femme fatale actress, then develops an obsession when it turns out she’s not entirely human. I really loved the hints at the mythic that eventually show up (I’m always a sucker for supernatural horror that uses mythology other than British paganism), and the ending is that specific kind of heartbreaking that always seems to show up in stories about supernatural people living in the normal human world (and always manages to get me a bit choked up).

* “Even the Pawn” by Joel Lane – A detective ends up on a case trying to solve the brutal murder of a massage parlor worker, and the case only gets more complicated when a hack director makes a sleazy movie about her life. Most of the story is a pretty straightforward detective story, but at the last minute, it packs a truly impressive amount of surreally disturbing imagery into one single paragraph. The payoff is definitely worth the buildup.

* “Tenderizer” by Stephen Graham Jones – A review of *Tenderizer*, the controversial new movie from a director of deeply unsettling arthouse films. The reviewer goes into so much detail about the movie’s origins (including trailers referencing a recent mass school shooting) and the director’s own past that *Tenderizer* feels so real that it’s uncomfortable. Every new detail just made me tense up even more at how things were going to play out, and the final reveals were the kind of thing that you just can’t look away from despite the horror and visceral skin-crawling dread. Even if *Tenderizer* itself is a pretty mundane movie, everything that it implies is so horrific I don’t think I can put it into words without spoiling it. It’s stories like this that really show how incredible SGJ is.

* “Ardor” by Laird Barron – Laird Barron writing movie horror? Involving an artsy gay porno horror version of *Dracula* with some truly nightmarish imagery and effects? I love Laird Barron’s writing, movie horror, *Dracula*, and gay porn, so consider me on board for this. (Apologies for the horny joke, but I couldn’t pass it up.) An investigator gets hired to try to track down a C-list horror actor (whose final role was the aforementioned porno) who came into possession of notes on a historical figure who Stoker met and likely inspired the character of Renfield. As you might imagine from a Barron story, the trek into the Alaskan wilderness goes unimaginably bad. If you know Laird Barron, you know what to expect. It’s gritty as hell, the reveals of the eldritch horror and the place where it rests are done wonderfully, there’s more than a few references to his other works (character names, locations, a certain sigil that we all know and love), it’s just amazing. I *really* need to buy *Swift to Chase* sooner rather than later.

* “Final Girl II: The Frame” by Daphne Gottlieb – Another poem, which I am generally not especially good at reviewing. I didn’t like this one as much as Snyder’s poem. The historical imagery is solid, but a lot of it is just talking about the final girl trope in a way that wasn’t super interesting to me.

* “Illimitable Dominion” by Kim Newman – A horror comedy story about the many, many Edgar Allan Poe adaptations starring Vincent Price that were released in the 60s by Roger Corman, and the unsettling effect that the movies have on all of Hollywood. Specifically, Poe’s work infecting the entire film industry. It’s pretty damn funny, and when Poe and Price begin to show up in movies they weren’t meant for, the bizarre results of Poe-mania blend creepy with hilarious really well. Maybe a weird choice to end the anthology on, but certainly a fun one.

If you like movie horror, *The Cutting Room* is definitely worth taking a look at. Not every story (or poem) in it really landed and I enjoyed more stories in the back half than I did in the front, but there’s not any outright terrible stories in the anthology, and the good outweighs the not-so-good. All in all, it’s a pretty solid read, I enjoyed it, and there’s definitely some stories in here I’ll be revisiting in the future.


***Final Cuts*** **(edited by Ellen Datlow)**

Again, not much else to say here. Ellen Datlow’s great. I like movie horror. This is a newer anthology of movie horror that she edited. Let’s go.

* “Das Gesicht” by Dale Bailey – An aging German director and a young woman with an interest in film history discuss his final movie, a lost film that horrified the public when it was screened. The slow-burn buildup of following the director and his stars (one of whom grew increasingly unhinged) is great, and when the tension reaches its peak and we learn what *Das Gesicht* actually was, it’s a wonderfully surreal filmmaking nightmare.

* “Drunk Physics” by Kelley Armstrong – Two housemates who have a YouTube series where they explain physics concepts while wasted start to notice what might be a ghost manifesting in the background of their videos, and their working relationship falls apart as a result. If you don’t mind the fact that the story plays a bit fast and loose with how making an online video series works, it’s a fun little character-focused ghost story. I enjoyed it.

* “Exhalation #10” by A.C. Wise – I’ve talked about this one before in my post about *The Best Horror of the Year, Vol. 13*, and it was recent enough that I don’t really have much more to say that I didn’t already say in that post. Spam filters aren't playing nice with links, but it’s pinned on my profile if you want my thoughts on this story in detail. If you just want the tldr: real good, real melancholy, loved it.

* “Scream Queen” by Nathan Ballingrud – Ditto. Already talked about it, not much more to say, see the above link if you want to read my earlier thoughts about it. It’s great. If you like Ballingrud, you’ll love this one. Even though it came after both *North American Lake Monsters* and *Wounds*, it feels like a bridge between the style of the two collections.

* “Family” by Lisa Morton – An American screenwriter trying to get an action movie made in Hong Kong and the producer he’s working with take a break from work to see a movie from a young up-and-comer in the film world. A lot of people describe her movie as a horror movie, but it seems to be a pretty straightforward family drama. Until it isn’t. A really great haunting story about death and grief, with plenty of background detail about China and Hong Kong’s film history to help build the world (and appeal to movie nerds like myself).

* “Night of the Living” by Paul Cornell – A movie theater manages to get their hands on a newly restored folk horror cult classic to screen during that time of day when all the local elderly folks come out to watch whatever’s showing. Unfortunately for everyone, the movie’s got a dark history. I’m always glad when movie theater-set horror lets us spend time with the characters working there before shit hits the fan, and this one does just that. Lovable characters, some disturbing implications behind the effects of the movie, and a real sad ending. It’s great.

* “The One We Tell Bad Children” by Laird Barron – I’m not especially familiar with the ins and outs of Barron’s multiple universes that he writes in and how they differ, but I know that he describes the setting of some of his stories as “Antiquity,” and I’m guessing this is one of them. The story takes place in a strange low fantasy world where Clint Eastwood and John Wayne were soldiers for the king and queen, and despite the medieval setting, early movie technology has been developed. When a bunch of kids watch a movie about doomed monarchy and the Children of Old Leech (apparently Old Leech and the Children are public knowledge in this world, which raises a LOT of questions), things inevitably go bad. I was absolutely fascinated by this story and all that it implies for the rest of the worlds that Barron’s stories take place in. The fact that the Old Leech movie has “Ardor” in the title also feels hugely significant, even if it’s not a vampire porno this time around. I don’t know how much more Barron’s written in Antiquity outside of this story and the Rumpelstiltskin bits of *The Croning*, but I absolutely need to find more of it.

* “Snuff in Six Scenes” by Richard Kadrey – A suicidal girl reaches out to a killer to make a snuff film with her in it. Things really don’t go as planned. I’m not sure if the ending worked for me and I think I would have liked the story to go longer, but the blend of pitch black comedy and surprisingly tragic conversations about life worked really well together.

* “Insanity Among Penguins” by Brian Hodge – A movie nerd and his video store owner friend end up invited to something truly rare: a screening of a lost Werner Herzog documentary entitled *Todestriebe*, which seems to be about lonely people who yearn to connect with other humans through death and cannibalism. Of course, there’s a reason the movie should have stayed lost. This story is very much in line with the sort of overwhelming bleakness that appears in other Hodge works like *The Immaculate Void*, “Scars in Progress”, and “One Possible Shape of Things to Come”, and though the cosmic elements aren’t as large-scale as in those other stories, the idea of overwhelming loneliness that drives people to seek death adds a layer of just crushing melancholy on top of everything that transpires in the film. It’s truly amazing, and like all of Hodge’s work that goes extremely dark and depressing, I’m going to be thinking about this one for a long time.

* “From the Balcony of the Idawolf Arms” by Jeffrey Ford – Two kids staying in their apartment while their mother is out witness some strange goings-on connected to the building’s owner. This one isn’t really movie horror (the kids watch the events of the story play out as silhouettes, like a movie or camera obscura), but it’s got some real solid surreal dark fantasy imagery in it.

* “Lords of the Matinee” by Stephen Graham Jones – Again, I already talked about this one pretty recently in my *BHotY 13* post. Check my user page if you want it. TLDR: extremely weird premise for a story, but SGJ makes it work surprisingly well. It’s good.

* “A Ben Evans Film” by Josh Malerman – A lonely man named Ben gets inspired to start making indie movies on his own. The fact that the only actor and actress he has are his dead parents might be something of a problem, though. Just a really great low-key horror story about some time in the life of a disturbed but seemingly harmless guy who really loves movies. (Also, apparently someone made a short film out of this one with actors from *The Greasy Strangler* and Rob Zombie’s *31* in leading roles, so I’ll definitely be making some time to watch that in the very near future.)

* “The Face Is a Mask” by Christopher Golden – A man seeks out a movie collector to try to get his hands on a mask from an unreleased horror movie from the 60s that his mother acted in. His mother incurred serious trauma on the set of the movie, and he hopes destroying the mask might be therapeutic. Obviously, messing around with props from lost films is generally a bad idea, and things take a turn for the worse. A lot of the buildup is your standard Spooky Cursed Film Lore fare, but when the shit really hits the fan, it’s remarkable. There’s a true sense of panic and chaos to the events that transpire. The buildup might not work, but the payoff sure as hell does.

* “Folie À Deux, or the Ticking Hourglass” by Usman T. Malik – In Pakistan, a serial child rapist and murderer guilty of crimes on an unimaginable scale has been arrested, and the plan is to brutally execute him on a live TV broadcast. Before this happens, the killer wants a reporter to track down an antique that his mother gave him. Despite the gruesome premise, the story is a lot more subtle than you’d expect, with an unexpected supernatural element and the whole thing deeply steeped in Pakistani culture and folklore. I think I might have to give this one a second read to really get everything that’s going on, but I really enjoyed how this one played out.

* “Hungry Girls” by Cassandra Khaw – A small American crew making a horror movie in Malaysia find out that the local girl the director recruited at a traditional Hungry Ghost Festival might be more than they bargained for. The horror of the story is admittedly pretty easy to figure out once you realize the direction things are going, but the prose is so vivid and lurid that you can practically feel the sweat and heat and spit. I almost wish the story was gorier just to see what kind of nightmares Khaw’s prose would have created.

* “Cut Frame” by Gemma Files – When I realized that Files was doing another epistolary horror story about film I could hardly contain my excitement. I already sing the praises of “each thing i show you is a piece of my death” all over this subreddit, and now there’s a spiritual sequel? You have no idea how overjoyed I am. In this case, the documents follow an interview between a paranormal researcher and a dentist who helped finance a horror movie in the 70s that starred Tamar Dusk, an actress legendary for her femme fatale roles (and unsettling events plaguing movies she starred in). As we learn more details about the people involved in the movie and Eastern European folklore starts to enter the picture, it quickly becomes clear that something dark was going on while this movie was being made. The final reveals are wonderfully done. It’s just a great story in general.

* “Many Mouths to Make a Meal” by Garth Nix – A fixer for a B-movie studio gets told to deal with an extra and quickly gets involved in something much stranger. Some real fun film noir-inspired horror with a weird monster, some great body horror imagery, and a perfectly open ending that made me want more of some of the characters involved.

* “Altered Beast, Altered Me” by John Langan – We end with the longest story in the book, told through e-mails between two author friends. Gaetan has purchased a famous prop of Dracula’s Ring that’s appeared in multiple Dracula movies throughout the years, and he sends his friend Michael some disturbing vampire stories involving a scary ring (and seem to be a little too similar to Gaetan’s own life). Meanwhile, Michael does research into the history of the prop, and discovers some strange stories from throughout the life of Bela Lugosi. This story is, without a doubt, the most Langan-y story that Langan has ever written. It’s got multiple stories within stories, wildly detailed stories of historical figures stumbling into unsettling events, references to the works of Langan’s good friend Laird Barron (yes, the film *Ardor* gets brought up several times), just about the only thing it’s missing is a reference to Huguenot. At times all the different layers of the story are overwhelming, but if you stick with it, it’s a hell of a tale. If you’re not familiar with the works of Langan, this is not one you should start with. But if you’re a huge Langan nerd who loves all of the idiosyncrasies he returns to so often throughout his bibliography, you’re going to have a hell of a good time with this one.

Whether or not it was intended as such, *Final Cuts* works perfectly as a spiritual sequel to *The Cutting Room*. Hell, on the whole, I’d say it surpasses *The Cutting Room* (although in the case of Barron and Files, I liked their *Cutting Room* stories more than their *Final Cuts* stories). If you like horror stories about movies, this is one you’ll want to pick up. Some of the plot elements of mysterious directors and femme fatale actors occasionally get a bit repetitive, but it’s never enough to sabotage the whole book. I think the best compare/contrast I could give is that *The Cutting Room* has a wider and more unique range of story topics, but *Final Cuts* is the one I enjoyed more on the whole. They make one hell of a double feature together.

Unsure what the next collections/anthologies I’m going to be reading are, but there will be more posts like this from me coming in the future. My local library’s got a few Richard Matheson collections available, so they’re definitely in consideration, but no promises. Have a good morning/evening/night, folks.",horrorlit,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/ss2y1s/some_short_story_thoughts_kissing_carrion_the/,Review,DraceNines,ss2y1s,/r/horrorlit/comments/ss2y1s/some_short_story_thoughts_kissing_carrion_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/ss2y1s/some_short_story_thoughts_kissing_carrion_the/,6,2022-02-14
"Some Short Story Thoughts (Kissing Carrion, The Cutting Room, Final Cuts)","Hi, I’m talking about more short stories. You probably know the drill by now. I read short story collections/anthologies, I post some thoughts on them, some folks on horrorlit enjoy my posts about them. Here are some thoughts on some stuff I’ve read lately.

***Kissing Carrion*** **by Gemma Files**

I’ve read several of Gemma Files’ short stories before and really enjoyed a lot of them, but this is my first time diving into her stuff outside of anthologies she appeared in. *Kissing Carrion* is her first collection (originally published in 2003), and I’m excited to crack into it. The back-of-the-book blurb mentions a story involving necrophilia right off the bat, so I’m expecting this to get into some wild shit and I am looking forward to it. Strap in for dark subject matter and sexual content, everyone.

* “Kissing Carrion” – Yep, necrophilia right off the bat. It’s that kind of book, folks! Consider this story a content warning for sexual stuff throughout the entire collection. We follow a twisted business partnership between a necrophile and a woman who developed a machine that allows her to puppeteer corpses. The two of them perform live sex shows together. I’m sure you can fill in the details yourself. Problem is, their partnership is slowly deteriorating thanks to behind-the-scenes drama. Also, the entire story is narrated from the point of view of the also-deteriorating corpse they’ve been using lately for the shows. It’s a damn good story that combines sleaze and deeply uncomfortable sex with afterlife mysticism and that contrast works incredibly well.

* “Keepsake” – A story about a woman trying to take care of her deeply ill brother. The blood-drinking kind of ill. Just a real solid vampire story with a lot of great 90s goth vibes. Not really much more to say about it without getting into spoilers surrounding a really fucked up twist, but it’s a good one.

* “Rose-Sick” – A horror erotica story about a man who goes home with someone supernatural in the wake of a break-up. Asphyxiation kink ensues. I can’t get into much detail without spoiling it, but Files uses really evocative prose and a bit of background worldbuilding to create something a lot more interesting than your typical sex with a paranormal entity story. The fact that the whole thing is told in second person perspective puts you as the reader maybe a little bit closer to the whole torrid affair than is comfortable. Loved this one.

* “Blood Makes Noise” – Man, nothing puts me in a state of sheer unadulterated primal goddamn panic like underwater horror. Thanks, Gemma Files! Anyways, this story is about a submarine stranded and dying at the bottom of the ocean, narrated by one of the only survivors in an effort to make sense of everything that happened, including him betraying the crew and some experiments involving a disturbing fossil that a rogue doctor found. It’s some pretty good deep sea cosmic horror, so if that’s your thing, give it a look.

* “Skeleton Bitch” – A goth rocker begins to develop an obsession with a girl he meets backstage at a venue, and it ends up unraveling him in the worst ways. The erotic elements and horror play off each other in ways that become disturbing once the reveal happens, and good lord is it a reveal to remember. It’s incredible. Also, “Skeleton Bitch” is just a really fun title to say.

* “Folly” – I’ve read a few of Gemma Files’ haunted house stories before, and they always leave an impact. This one is no exception. The narration takes the form of a haunted house ghost tour guide’s spiel, and as we learn more of the house’s dark history and strange architecture, it quickly becomes clear that there’s something deeply wrong going on. I’ve noticed that the tendency with the Files haunted house stories that I’ve read seems to be that the ghosts themselves take the backseat, and the architecture and behavior of the building itself provides the true horror. It’s always really memorable. This one is just a real good scary house story.

* “Mouthful of Pins” – When they were young, a group of children who bonded over their experiences of abuse invented a dark fantasy world and terrifying monsters to rule it. Now they’re grown up, and their fantasy world is looking for them. I’ve mentioned before that horror fantasy can be very hit or miss for me, but this one really works in the best ways. The hints we get of what was in the fantasy world are just enough to provide hints at the terror without going into explicit detail, and I really wish I could know more about the mythos these kids created. Damn good.

* “Pretend That We’re Dead” – Toronto is haunted. Something happened, and now the entire city is infested with surreal-looking ghosts, most notably during a weekly event when they form a procession and march down one street in particular. With this as the background, we get the life story of a girl who’s part of the goth subculture of people born right around the time the infestation started. It’s grim as hell, and the story highlights tragedy, depression, and alienation in hard-hitting ways with some great imagery from Toronto’s ghosts. As a side note, I’m now wondering if the imagery of ghosts forming a parade acted as inspiration for a certain legendary goth rock opera. *When I was…*

* “No Darkness But Ours” – An encounter between a family on a roadtrip and a strange and unsettling girl wandering the countryside. Most of this story didn’t really land for me, but I did like the disturbing hints given for the wanderer’s history and how it turned her into what she is now.

* “Job 37” – An interview between paranormal researchers and the head of a cleanup crew that deals with dead bodies about something disturbing the team encountered on a job. The buildup involves all the gruesome details of cleaning up decaying corpses, and when we finally get the reveal, the lack of gore and viscera makes it all the more horrific.

* “Bear-Shirt” – A gay man who used to be in a relationship with a neonazi with an unhealthy interest in Viking mysticism reflects on their time together as he is drawn back to a cabin in the woods where they spent time together. Most of the story is focused on building up the dynamics between the two characters, but when the supernatural finally enters the picture, it’s striking.

* “Hidebound” – A security guard starts noticing some odd types around the building she’s keeping an eye on, and things start to go bad very quickly. The most gruesome details are left in the background, and the abandoned-building-at-nighttime really works as a setting that builds up the tension. It’s pretty good!

* “Skin City” – The story of a man trying to track down an old friend, who accidentally summoned something dark years ago and is now doing terrible things that involve flaying a whole bunch of people. A really great little noir horror story with some really gruesome gore and body horror.

* “Seen” – A story written as a short film screenplay, involving two detectives trying to solve the murder of an entire family. It’s pretty good and I liked the supernatural implications, but it ends just as it really starts to get going. I kind of wish there was an expanded version of it.

* “Torch Song” – When an ex-cop finds out his former partner is investigating some disturbing murders, it turns out that they might be linked back to an old case involving a love cult that they worked together years ago. That case ended with one party doing something monstrous to the other, so things aren’t great between the two of them. An unsettling, gritty crime horror story where the aftermath of a case is as horrific as the case itself.

* “The Diarist” – Journal entries from someone who is taking a breakup very badly. Don’t have much to say about this one. “Interior monologue from a stalker” stories don’t always work for me, but this one had a ritualistic occult angle that made it a lot more interesting.

* “Dead Bodies Possessed By Furious Motion” – One last vampire story to close it out. We follow Elder, a vampire who is sick and tired of the established rules and power structures of vampire society, and is making plans to find a new life for herself among the stars. This one’s got loads of goth vibes, blood-soaked sex (I will use the phrase “blood snowballing” and leave the rest up to your imaginations. Have fun with that imagery, fuckers!), and power struggles within vampire leadership. Great characters, a plot that gets real wild once we learn Elder’s plan, some laughs over the idea of the story’s distant future being the year 2020, just a damn good vamp story in general.

*Kissing Carrion* is a damn great collection, and if you’re looking for goth horror, erotic horror, or extreme horror of the 90s, it’s definitely one to check out. I don’t think I have much more to say that I haven’t already said. It’s real good, and I’m definitely looking forward to reading Files’ other collections in the future. 

Also, apparently a few stories from this collection were adapted as episodes of a Canadian vampire horror anthology TV series called *The Hunger*, so I might have to check that out. In Files’ afterword, she mentions that “Keepsake” was on the table for a potential adaptation, but every executive involved in the show immediately passed as soon as they read the &gt;!incestuous menstrual-blood-drinking vampire cunnilingus!&lt; scene. Can’t imagine why they didn’t want to put that on television. Anyways, if there’s anyone reading this who’s watched *The Hunger* before, please let me know what you thought of Files’ episodes or the show in general.

***The Cutting Room*** **(Edited by Ellen Datlow)**

Not much to say about this one. I love movies. I love horror. I love horror about movies. Ellen Datlow puts out some really incredible anthologies. All reasons I got interested in this one. I’ve read a couple stories in here before, but the majority of them are new to me. I’m very excited to read it.

* “The Cutter” by Edward Bryant – The story of a young movie theater employee and the theater’s owner, a strange man who edits his own versions of the movies before showing them. The owner has an unrequited crush on a local patron of the theater, and before the end, things turn bad. I was expecting the story to get a lot weirder and more supernatural, but it was a pretty decent story all the same. If you’re a fan of King-esque childhood nostalgia horror with kid protagonists, you’ll probably enjoy this one.

* “The Hanged Man of Oz” by Steve Nagy – A man learns about the urban legend of the suicide victim in the background of *The Wizard of Oz* from a movie nerd he’s dating, and as he becomes more obsessed, Oz starts to haunt him. Again, another story where what I expected was not what I got (*Candyman* and the likes have made me come to expect a lot of ruminations on the nature of fiction and reality when urban legends are brought up in horror), but it’s still a real solid tale with some creepy movie imagery.

* “Deadspace” by Dennis Etchison – A movie producer waits for a callback from a movie star in a nice hotel in California. Not too much of a plot here so this is going to be brief, but if you like unsettling vibes and surreal imagery and don’t mind a very slow plot, it’s a good one.

* “Cuts” by F. Paul Wilson – A movie director coming off of a recent bomb begins to experience a terrifying affliction that stems from bad blood between himself and the author whose book he adapted. This one had potential but it didn’t really land for me. The body horror aspects are great, but the villain’s motivation is pretty far-fetched, the supernatural elements weren’t really used to their full potential, and what seemed like an interesting dynamic between the hero and villain kind of fell apart in the final scene when the villain becomes downright cartoonish.

* “Final Girl Theory” by A.C. Wise – I talked about this one very briefly in my Best Horror of the Year posts. This one is the story of a disturbing old horror movie called *Kaleidoscope*, one with many open questions about its history and a cultlike hold on its fanbase. It’s also about a young man who meets an actress from it. This one’s so open-ended that it’ll probably be hit or miss for a lot of people, but it really works for me. The lurid descriptions of *Kaleidoscope*’s horrors combined with the ambiguity of what the movie actually is are incredibly striking, and those open-ended questions really highlight the idea of fear of the unknown. It’s just an incredible story and I’m going to be thinking about it for a very long time.

* “Lapland, or Film Noir” by Peter Straub – Please note that this story is on JSTOR, so you might not be able to access it unless you have access through your workplace or college or whatever. Peter Straub is a name I see frequently here on horrorlit, but I’ve never really read anything by him before. “Lapland” is a weird and experimental story and I’m not sure if I’d call it horror, but it’s real good. We learn about the populace and typical routines of a town in Florida (as a Floridian myself, I am legally required to say hell yeah baby Sunshine fuckin State fuck yeah let’s go) where everything plays out as a film noir. Most men are detectives, the women are all femme fatales who die young, and the weather is perpetually wet and rainy (OK, that last one is true of all of Florida, not much of a shock there). I had to give the ending a second read to really understand what was going on, but it’s pretty great once you get a handle on what it means. This probably is not at all representative of the rest of Straub’s works, but I enjoyed it.

* “The Thousand Cuts” by Ian Watson – A darkly comic apocalypse story about the world experiencing a phenomenon where reality is repeatedly jumping forward in time, with everyone on the planet skipping days and weeks with no memory of what happened in that period. Almost as if something or someone is editing reality like a film. While not really outright terrifying, it’s a pretty fun speculative fiction story with a really interesting concept. I enjoyed it. (Also, while reading it I had a sudden vision of myself as Bart Simpson at the chalkboard, writing “I Will Not Make *JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure* Jokes” over and over again. If you know, you know.)

* “Occam’s Ducks” by Howard Waldrop – Gonna be completely honest, most of this one just went over my head. We start with the mysterious temporary disappearance of D.W. Griffith and his film crew during a shoot at sea in Florida, then jump to strange events surrounding the filming of a remake of *The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari* in the early 20th Century. Some interesting ideas but it never really added up for me. You might be able to make more sense of it than I did.

* “Dead Image” by David Morrell – Hey, holy shit, that’s the guy who wrote *First Blood* and created Rambo! “Dead Image” follows a screenwriter named David who makes an interesting discovery in the background of his current project: an extra named Wes who looks exactly like James ~~Dean~~ Deacon, an actor who could have had an incredible career but died tragically young. As David and Wes form a friendship and start working on bigger projects together, more and more unsettling similarities between Wes and Deacon start coming to light, and whatever these similarities mean, they spell trouble. The buildup of suspense is incredible, and the big reveal at the end is both horrific and tragic.

* “The Constantinople Archives” by Robert Shearman – Less horror, more speculative fiction. Told in the form of an academic essay, we learn some film history from the Byzantine Empire in a world where silent film technology was invented in the 1400s. It was an interesting idea for an alt history story, but not horror unless you want to really stretch.

* “each thing i show you is a piece of my death” by Gemma Files &amp; Stephen J. Barringer – I fucking love this story, so you might have seen me talk it up on horrorlit before now. It’s an epistolary horror story about a strange phenomenon where a naked man appears in the background of music videos, TV shows, and movies. Nobody has any idea who keeps editing this guy in or how it’s being done, but the story traces the origins back to disturbing footage sent anonymously to two experimental filmmakers in Canada. It’s a goddamn amazing story. The story gives just enough reveals that we get the implications of what is going on, but the biggest mysteries are still left open to make it even more unsettling. I cannot recommend this one enough.

* “Cinder Images” by Gary McMahon – Strange events in the aftermath of a screening of a disturbing war movie. I don’t really have much to say about this one beyond I enjoyed it. Some really gruesome war imagery here that really worked well.

* “The Pied Piper of Hammersmith” by Nicholas Royle – A pretty solid story about a train worker who is not entirely stable. Getting into more details would be spoiler-y and I had to give it a reread or two to actually understand what was going on, but I really liked the imagery of trains as movies.

* “Filming the Making of the Film of the Making of *Fitzcarraldo*” by Garry Kilworth – A film crew gets word about the production of Werner Herzog’s movie *Fitzcarrraldo*, and they head out to make a documentary about the how the movie was made. Unfortunately, there’s already a crew making a documentary about how *Fitzcarraldo* was made (it’s called *Burden of Dreams*), so the story’s fictional movie crew ends up making a documentary about the making of *Burden of Dreams*. And when they try to inject their own drama into the multiple film shoots, surrealist insanity begins to set in and things go to hell. The story plays with the idea of layers (of fiction, of filmmaking, of memory) in some interesting ways, although there was one bit that I think was mostly just for shock value that didn’t horrify in the same ways as the rest of the story (layers of incest, in this case). Despite that one flaw, I do think the story worked really well and I really enjoyed it.

* “Onlookers” by Gary A. Braunbeck – Boy, people sure do love a good “normal-looking person but with an inanimate object for a head” character design, huh? People with TVs for heads, people with flowers for heads, people with speakers or phones or planets for heads, it’s just a real fun bit of surreal character design that you see all over the damn place. Seriously, you have no idea how many millennial and gen Z artists on Twitter and Tumblr have surrealist object head OCs. René Magritte would be proud. Anyways. “Onlookers” has some really good creepy inanimate object head critters, and they’re appearing to a man who, as a boy, ended up wandering into the filming of Samuel Beckett’s short film *Film*, starring Buster Keaton. This one is a goddamn great cosmic horror story. Great imagery, some twists and turns that made my jaw drop, an incredible concept behind the whole plot, plenty of film theory discussion that I loved because I’m an insufferable nerd, just a wonderful story all the way through. Next time folks ask for movie horror recommendations, I’m definitely bringing this one up.

* “Recreation” by Lucy A. Snyder – This one is a poem, and a short one at that, so I don’t really have much to say at it. Neat imagery. I liked it.

* “Bright Lights, Big Zombie” by Douglas E. Winter – In the midst of the zombie apocalypse, you, the protagonist, are an employee for a horror movie magazine that’s slowly dying thanks to the American government going into a new Video Nasty moral panic and banning any movie with gore in it. The fact that you deal in an underground black market of horror movies means you’re in danger of getting on their bad side. Man, I did not expect this story to hit as hard as it did. There’s some standard zombie action near the end, but most of the story is focused on depicting a country in the midst of a slow, boring apocalypse, where the monotony of constant doom and despair hollows people out into shells of their former selves, while the forces of government lose their fucking minds over completely irrelevant things and take actions that help nobody. Given the current state of things, it resonated quite a fucking bit. Great story, but good god, it made me want to drink.

* “She Drives the Men to Crimes of Passion!” by Genevieve Valentine – A dark fantasy story about a director in the 30s who discovers a perfect femme fatale actress, then develops an obsession when it turns out she’s not entirely human. I really loved the hints at the mythic that eventually show up (I’m always a sucker for supernatural horror that uses mythology other than British paganism), and the ending is that specific kind of heartbreaking that always seems to show up in stories about supernatural people living in the normal human world (and always manages to get me a bit choked up).

* “Even the Pawn” by Joel Lane – A detective ends up on a case trying to solve the brutal murder of a massage parlor worker, and the case only gets more complicated when a hack director makes a sleazy movie about her life. Most of the story is a pretty straightforward detective story, but at the last minute, it packs a truly impressive amount of surreally disturbing imagery into one single paragraph. The payoff is definitely worth the buildup.

* “Tenderizer” by Stephen Graham Jones – A review of *Tenderizer*, the controversial new movie from a director of deeply unsettling arthouse films. The reviewer goes into so much detail about the movie’s origins (including trailers referencing a recent mass school shooting) and the director’s own past that *Tenderizer* feels so real that it’s uncomfortable. Every new detail just made me tense up even more at how things were going to play out, and the final reveals were the kind of thing that you just can’t look away from despite the horror and visceral skin-crawling dread. Even if *Tenderizer* itself is a pretty mundane movie, everything that it implies is so horrific I don’t think I can put it into words without spoiling it. It’s stories like this that really show how incredible SGJ is.

* “Ardor” by Laird Barron – Laird Barron writing movie horror? Involving an artsy gay porno horror version of *Dracula* with some truly nightmarish imagery and effects? I love Laird Barron’s writing, movie horror, *Dracula*, and gay porn, so consider me on board for this. (Apologies for the horny joke, but I couldn’t pass it up.) An investigator gets hired to try to track down a C-list horror actor (whose final role was in the aforementioned porno) who came into possession of notes on a historical figure who Stoker met and likely inspired the character of Renfield. As you might imagine from a Barron story, the trek into the Alaskan wilderness goes unimaginably bad. If you know Laird Barron, you know what to expect. It’s gritty as hell, the reveals of the eldritch horror and the place where it rests are done wonderfully, there’s more than a few references to his other works (character names, locations, a certain circular sigil that we all know and love), it’s just amazing. I *really* need to buy *Swift to Chase* sooner rather than later.

* “Final Girl II: The Frame” by Daphne Gottlieb – Another poem, which I am generally not very good at talking about. I didn’t like this one as much as Snyder’s poem. The historical imagery is solid, but a lot of it is just talking about the final girl trope in a way that wasn’t super interesting to me.

* “Illimitable Dominion” by Kim Newman – A horror comedy story about the many, many Edgar Allan Poe adaptations starring Vincent Price that were released in the 60s by Roger Corman, and the unsettling effect that the movies have on all of Hollywood. Specifically, Poe’s work infecting the entire film industry. It’s pretty damn funny, and when Poe and Price begin to show up in movies they weren’t meant for, the bizarre results of Poe-mania blend creepy with hilarious really well. Maybe a weird choice to end the anthology on, but certainly a fun one.

If you like movie horror, *The Cutting Room* is definitely worth taking a look at. Not every story (or poem) in it really landed and I enjoyed more stories in the back half than I did in the front, but there’s not any outright terrible stories in the anthology, and the good outweighs the not-so-good. All in all, it’s a pretty solid read, I enjoyed it, and there’s definitely some stories in here I’ll be revisiting in the future.

***Final Cuts*** **(edited by Ellen Datlow)**

Again, not much else to say here. Ellen Datlow’s great. I like movie horror. This is a newer anthology of movie horror that she edited. Let’s go.

* “Das Gesicht” by Dale Bailey – An aging German director and a young woman with an interest in film history discuss his final movie, a lost film that horrified the public when it was screened. The slow-burn buildup of following the director and his stars (one of whom grew increasingly unhinged) is great, and when the tension reaches its peak and we learn what *Das Gesicht* actually was, it’s a wonderfully surreal filmmaking nightmare.

* “Drunk Physics” by Kelley Armstrong – Two housemates who have a YouTube series where they explain physics concepts while wasted start to notice what might be a ghost manifesting in the background of their videos, and their working relationship falls apart as a result. If you don’t mind the fact that the story plays a bit fast and loose with how making an online video series works, it’s a fun little character-focused ghost story. I enjoyed it.

* “Exhalation #10” by A.C. Wise – I’ve talked about this one before in my post about *The Best Horror of the Year, Vol. 13*, and it was recent enough that I don’t really have much more to say that I didn’t already say in that post. If you just want the tldr: real good, real melancholy, loved it.

* “Scream Queen” by Nathan Ballingrud – Ditto. Already talked about it, not much more to say, see the above link if you want to read my earlier thoughts about it. It’s great. If you like Ballingrud, you’ll love this one. Even though it came after both *North American Lake Monsters* and *Wounds*, it feels like a bridge between the style of the two collections.

* “Family” by Lisa Morton – An American screenwriter trying to get an action movie made in Hong Kong and the producer he’s working with take a break from work to see a movie from a young up-and-comer in the film world. A lot of people describe her movie as a horror movie, but it seems to be a pretty straightforward family drama. Until it isn’t. A really great haunting story about death and grief, with plenty of background detail about China and Hong Kong’s film history to help build the world (and appeal to movie nerds like myself).

* “Night of the Living” by Paul Cornell – A movie theater manages to get their hands on a newly restored folk horror cult classic to screen during that time of day when all the local elderly folks come out to watch whatever’s showing. Unfortunately for everyone, the movie’s got a dark history. I’m always glad when movie theater-set horror lets us spend time with the characters working there before shit hits the fan, and this one does just that. Lovable characters, some disturbing implications behind the effects of the movie, and a real sad ending. It’s great.

* “The One We Tell Bad Children” by Laird Barron – I’m not especially familiar with the ins and outs of Barron’s multiple universes that he writes in and how they differ, but I know that he describes the setting of some of his stories as “Antiquity,” and I’m guessing this is one of them. The story takes place in a strange low fantasy world where Clint Eastwood and John Wayne were soldiers for the king and queen, and despite the medieval setting, early movie technology has been developed. When a bunch of kids watch a movie about doomed monarchy and the Children of Old Leech (apparently Old Leech and the Children are public knowledge in this world, which raises a LOT of questions), things inevitably go bad. I was absolutely fascinated by this story and all that it implies for the rest of the worlds that Barron’s stories take place in. The fact that the Old Leech movie has “Ardor” in the title also feels hugely significant, even if it’s not a vampire porno this time around. I don’t know how much more Barron’s written in Antiquity outside of this story and the Rumpelstiltskin bits of *The Croning*, but I absolutely need to find more of it.

* “Snuff in Six Scenes” by Richard Kadrey – A suicidal girl reaches out to a killer to make a snuff film with her as the star. Things really don’t go as planned. I’m not sure if the ending worked for me and I think I would have liked the story to go longer, but the blend of pitch black comedy and surprisingly tragic conversations about life worked really well together.

* “Insanity Among Penguins” by Brian Hodge – A movie nerd and his video store owner friend end up invited to something truly rare: a screening of a lost Werner Herzog documentary entitled *Todestriebe*, which seems to be about lonely people who yearn to connect with other humans through death and cannibalism. Of course, there’s a reason the movie should have stayed lost. This story is very much in line with the sort of overwhelming bleakness that appears in other Hodge works like *The Immaculate Void*, “Scars in Progress”, and “One Possible Shape of Things to Come”, and though the cosmic elements aren’t as large-scale as in those other stories, the idea of overwhelming loneliness that drives people to seek death adds a layer of just crushing melancholy on top of everything that transpires in the film. It’s truly amazing, and like all of Hodge’s work that goes extremely dark and depressing, I’m going to be thinking about this one for a long time.

* “From the Balcony of the Idawolf Arms” by Jeffrey Ford – Two kids staying in their apartment while their mother is out witness some strange goings-on connected to the building’s owner. This one isn’t really movie horror (the kids watch the events of the story play out as silhouettes, like a camera obscura - I guess that's the movie connection?), but it’s got some real solid surreal dark fantasy imagery in it.

* “Lords of the Matinee” by Stephen Graham Jones – Again, I already talked about this one pretty recently in my *BHotY 13* post. Link’s further up the page if you want it. TLDR: extremely weird premise for a story, but SGJ makes it work surprisingly well. It’s good.

* “A Ben Evans Film” by Josh Malerman – A lonely man named Ben gets inspired to start making indie movies on his own. The fact that the only actor and actress he has are his dead parents might be something of a problem, though. Just a really great low-key horror story about some time in the life of a disturbed but seemingly harmless guy who really loves movies. (Also, apparently someone made a short film out of this one with actors from *The Greasy Strangler* and Rob Zombie’s *31* in leading roles, so I’ll definitely be making some time to watch that in the very near future.)

* “The Face Is a Mask” by Christopher Golden – A man seeks out a movie collector to try to get his hands on a mask from an unreleased horror movie from the 60s that his mother acted in. His mother incurred serious trauma on the set of the movie, and he hopes destroying the mask might be therapeutic. Obviously, messing around with props from lost films is generally a bad idea, and things take a turn for the worse. A lot of the buildup is your standard Spooky Cursed Film Lore fare, but when the shit really hits the fan, it’s remarkable. There’s a true sense of panic and chaos to the events that transpire. The buildup might not work, but the payoff sure as hell does.

* “Folie À Deux, or the Ticking Hourglass” by Usman T. Malik – In Pakistan, a serial child rapist and murderer guilty of crimes on an unimaginable scale has been arrested, and the plan is to brutally execute him on a live TV broadcast. Before this happens, the killer wants a reporter to track down an antique that his mother gave him. Despite the gruesome premise, the story is a lot more subtle than you’d expect, with an unexpected supernatural element and the whole thing deeply steeped in Pakistani culture and folklore. I think I might have to give this one a second read to really get everything that’s going on, but I really enjoyed how this one played out.

* “Hungry Girls” by Cassandra Khaw – A small American crew making a horror movie in Malaysia find out that the local girl the director recruited at a traditional Hungry Ghost Festival might be more than they bargained for. The horror of the story is admittedly pretty easy to figure out once you realize the direction things are going, but the prose is so vivid and lurid that you can practically feel the sweat and heat and spit. I almost wish the story was gorier just to see what kind of nightmares Khaw’s prose would have created.

* “Cut Frame” by Gemma Files – When I realized that Files was doing another epistolary horror story about film I could hardly contain my excitement. I already sing the praises of “each thing i show you is a piece of my death” all over this subreddit, and now there’s a spiritual sequel? You have no idea how overjoyed I am. In this case, the documents follow an interview between a paranormal researcher and a dentist who helped finance a horror movie in the 70s that starred Tamar Dusk, an actress legendary for her femme fatale roles (and unsettling events plaguing movies she starred in). As we learn more details about the people involved in the movie and Eastern European folklore starts to enter the picture, it quickly becomes clear that something dark was going on while this movie was being made. The final reveals are wonderfully done. It’s just a great story in general.

* “Many Mouths to Make a Meal” by Garth Nix – A fixer for a B-movie studio gets told to deal with an extra and quickly gets involved in something much stranger. Some real fun film noir-inspired horror with a weird monster, some great body horror imagery, and a perfectly open ending that made me want more of some of the characters involved. (Also, when I was a kid I really loved Garth Nix’s Keys to the Kingdom series, so I’m always excited to see his more adult-focused writing show up in anthologies.)

* “Altered Beast, Altered Me” by John Langan – We end with the longest story in the book, told through e-mails between two author friends. Gaetan has purchased a famous prop of Dracula’s Ring that’s appeared in multiple Dracula movies throughout the years, and he sends his friend Michael some disturbing vampire stories involving a scary ring (and seem to be a little too similar to Gaetan’s own life). Meanwhile, Michael does research into the history of the prop, and discovers some strange stories from throughout the life of Bela Lugosi. This story is, without a doubt, the most Langan-y story that Langan has ever written. It’s got multiple stories within stories, wildly detailed stories of historical figures stumbling into unsettling events, references to the works of Langan’s good friend Laird Barron (yes, the film *Ardor* gets brought up several times), just about the only thing it’s missing is a reference to Huguenot. At times all the different layers of the story are overwhelming, but if you stick with it, it’s a hell of a tale. If you’re not familiar with the works of Langan, this is not one you should start with. But if you’re a huge Langan nerd who loves all of the idiosyncrasies he returns to so often throughout his bibliography, you’re going to have a hell of a good time with this one.

Whether or not it was intended as such, *Final Cuts* works perfectly as a spiritual sequel to *The Cutting Room*. Hell, on the whole, I’d say it surpasses *The Cutting Room* (although in the case of Barron and Files, I liked their *Cutting Room* stories more than their *Final Cuts* stories). If you like horror stories about movies, this is one you’ll want to pick up. Some of the plot elements of mysterious directors and femme fatale actors occasionally get a bit repetitive, but it’s never enough to sabotage the whole book. I think the best compare/contrast I could give is that *The Cutting Room* has a wider and more unique range of story topics, but *Final Cuts* is the one I enjoyed more on the whole. They make one hell of a double feature together.

Unsure what the next collections/anthologies I’m going to be reading are, but there will be more posts like this from me coming in the future. My local library’s got a few Richard Matheson collections available, so they’re definitely in consideration, but no promises. Have a good morning/evening/night, folks.",horrorlit,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/ss2sqd/some_short_story_thoughts_kissing_carrion_the/,Review,DraceNines,ss2sqd,/r/horrorlit/comments/ss2sqd/some_short_story_thoughts_kissing_carrion_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/ss2sqd/some_short_story_thoughts_kissing_carrion_the/,1,2022-02-14

Operation Avenger,"Just off the coast of the landmass called Africa, on the bridge of the sacred galactic temple, the leader of the Ethereal Invasion Force pondered on the events of the past solar cycle. This new race, these humans, seemingly weak and vulnerable, had managed to become quite the challenge. Despite being such a separate and diverse race, their governments had come together to form a united front against the threat from above. An enemy unknown to them. 

*""XCOM...""*

Now they feel a surge through the psionic network, a powerful omen as humanity proves themselves worthy of the effort and cost of this war. They utilze the vernacular of the Butcher, a human female named Vahlen, and drive the majesty of their position into the mind of this volunteer: they are the outstanding...the supreme...the ""Uber"" of the Ethereals. 

*""At long last...YOU have succeeded...where WE have failed...""*

This human, this ""Delta Two"", most assuredly possesses the Gift. A power that is on par with that of the Uber Ethereal. How incredible the past solar cycle has been, and how dizzying the success of the humans in so short a time. 

It initially seemed like yet another failed experiment, when the humans had their first sorty with the first wave of test troops: a massacre that left only one of their own victorious. Those first few months the humans seemed to struggle against even the most basic Sectoid, and were sure to be slaughtered by Thin Men. Floaters killed with their usual impunity, and the terror of the Chrysalids ravaged many human cities. True, XCOM had small victories here and there, but nothing that indicated humanity was anything special. 

Then the humans began to take captives. Somehow, their Butcher found a way to extract useful information from the minds of the abduction crews and scouting parties. It was then that humanity began to display their growing tenacity. 

First came the improvements in their armaments and defenses, as humans utilized their limited war prizes to gird themselves more effectively against the growing threat. Then came the hybrids, a desperate gamble against the oncoming hordes, where the humans of XCOM used the Ethereals' genetic bonding serum to introduce the genetic materal of their own enemies within their very bodies. Soon after came the cybernetic warriors, a marriage of flesh and metal; hulks of alloy and elerium that would rival the Berserker and Mechtoid. The humans had bodies malleable and various, able to incorporate such foreign elements so effectively. They were not above allowing the enemy within themselves, all for the sake of possible victory. This was an interesting display, but it did little to convince the High Council that they could be more than useful genetic stock to improve the current hordes at their command. 

But then the humans managed to do something that the others races had come no where close to achieving. In only half a solar cycle, the humans mounted a surgical assault on the Ethereals' terrestrial base of operations. A research facility, where successfully abducted test subjects could be studied, vivisected, and liquified to meet the needs of the campaign. With only a small team of six warriors, the humans managed to not only take the facility, but to defeat a Sectoid Commander, one of the very beings that had once made them its playthings not so long ago. 

It was then that some members of the Council began to worry that perhaps these humans just might pose an actual threat. The response was swift and staggering: a full tactical assault at the very heart of XCOM. They managed to survive, but not without great costs. Their numbers were halved, and global support was shaken. There were those in the Council who believed that XCOM would crumble, and once more their efforts would fail to bear fruit. 

They were answered by a human space craft, created in the image of the Ethereals own spacecraft, firing plasma weaponry at supply barges and large scouting vessels. These ""Firestorms"" soon protected every landmass, negating the arial advantage the Ethereals had been relying on. Not even battleships could guarantee success against this new threat. The members of the High Council took it upon themselves to lead the offensive personally, hoping to subvert the new gains of XCOM. Then everything changed when the personal stealth scouting craft of one of the lower members of the Council, Ethereal Praxis, was discovered and shot down. Perhaps the humans had only been lucky, and their attempt to overtake Praxis would be thoroughly thwarted. 

The remaining security force did not see the warrior shooting concentrated plasma bolts from far beyond the treeline, nor the assault of humans bearing armor and plasma weaponry that matched that provided to only the Elite of the security forces. Praxis met their end in a manner most vicious: being pummeled and launched against the wall of their craft by the kinetic strike module of a cybernetic warrior. 

Many more members of the Council would fall to XCOM, as their warriors began to discover and develop psionic abilities. Heavy Floaters became target practice, Sectopods were only distractions, Muton Elites their psionic playthings. It soon came to pass that - even with every advanced unit at their disposal - Ethereals were met with either death, capture, or - in one horrifying case - mental domination by a mere human. 

It seemed too good to be true for the Uber Ethereal. No species had ever showed this much raw potential, this mix of physicality, intelligence, ferocity, and psionic capacity, all at once. The final piece fell into place this day, three hundred and sixty five rotations, a full solar cycle since the initial invasion, when a psionic warrior volunteered to activiate the transponder to the Ethereals' psionic network. 

A final test must be administered. 

The Uber Ethereal uncloaks the Templeship; its majesty and imposing mass shake the very planet and project the final challenge to XCOM. It does not take them long to send an aircraft bearing one last surgical strike force. One last opportunity to confirm the Uber Ethereal's hopes. 

As the strike force makes their way to the bridge, the Uber calls out to the Volunteer, delivering the invitation to approach their impending legacy.

*""You hear our voice, New One, now listen well… Long have we watched… and waited. So many promising subjects, so many failed efforts. And now, after untold trials, the New One emerges to face the rigors of our collective… An enduring physical form, paired with an equally adept mental capacity – the rarest of traits, finally within our grasp.""*

The Uber sets up a gauntlet for the Volunteer to test their newfound power against the now useless creatures that made up a once imposing and horrifying strike force. 

They slaughter the Sectoids, cowards who could never use their psionic potential to assert themselves against the Ethereal threat. They dismantle the Cyberdisks and their Drone counterparts; the Volunteer laughs as he pulls them apart with a psychic rift. 

*""It is as we hoped… the New One has surpassed all that have come before… and with such great confidence… so skilled with the Gift.""*

The Floaters are obliterated by a cybernetic warrior. Their inferiority made painfully clear as they explode from the beam of her particle cannon. The Chrysalids seem to throw themselves in to walls of debris fired from an alloy cannon as they attempt one last hopeless assault. The Thin Men fall quickly to a hybrid warrior, their genetic enhancements allowing them to render the formerly swift and deadly invaders impotent of any lethality. The Mutons are their playthings, and are quickly dispatched as they involuntarily obliterate themselves with grenades. The two Sectopods, weapons meant to subdue and conquer, are quickly rendered to piles of scrap as orbs of concentrated plasma hum and explode between their legs; launched from outside their targeting range. 

The Uber Ethereal has two Elite Mutons guard the door to the bridge, serving more as a signal to progress than any real measure of security. The Uber Ethereal addresses the volunteer as they efficiently dispatch the Elites with one more rift. 

*""The New One continues to surge… to prove that this was the worthy path, that we were justified in our efforts. This will bring about our redemption, and usher in our future…""*

A thousand hopes will soon be fulfilled. A thousand failures shall soon be redeemed. These humans, once so frail and impotent, have proven themselves worthy of the Gift. Worthy to be the new hosts that the Ethereals have been seeking for eons. 

*""Behold the greatest failure… of the Ethereal Ones…""* They say as the warriors of XCOM enter into the sanctuary. *""We who failed to ascend as they thought we would. We who were cast out. We who were doomed to feed on the Gift of lesser beings… as we sought to uplift them… to prepare them… for what lies ahead.""*

The Uber is joined by their Lieutenants, Secun and Tertia, and the royal Elites. The XCOM warriors take up defensive positions as the Uber Ethereal continues. 

*""The hunt draws to a close. It was not a vain undertaking… but a necessity, as our physical form has grown… ineffective. Our search for a perfect specimen was driven by our own crippling limitation, and now, at long last…""*

The Uber is cut short by the shrieks of Tertia being attacked by their guard, followed soon by the final death wail as a concentrated plasma bolt pierces their torso. 

This isn't right. This isn't the will of the Uber! Do they not realize they lack the vision and understanding to properly wield this power?! 

*""This is not your path! Not your purpose! You need our guidance to hone this power… without us, what are you?""*

The Uber shields their fragile body as orbs of plasma detonate, enveloping Secun in a fiery display of viscera and rebellion. 

""What are we?!"" shouts the volunteer, putting his hands to the temples of his head. 

Another concentrated blast hits the Uber in his shoulder, their attempt to mind control one of the warriors foiled by the use of some sort of mind shield. 

""WE! ARE! XCOM! WE WILL *ALWAYS* BE WATCHING!"" 

The Uber feels the psionic pressure building before feeling themselves being torn in pieces by the psionic rift that appears in front of them. 

Ungrateful, unintelligent, unworthy worms! How dare they reject the Gift, the progress, the magnanimity of the Ethereals?! They who would have safeguarded the universe?! They who gave these humans the means with which to so effortlessly adapt and thrive! Do they think themselves greater than the mighty Ethereals? They who bring all under their dominion?! They who know the secrets of space and time?! No! This shall not stand! 

As the Ethereal begins to feel their grasp on mortality slip, they send a psionic message across the cosmos, reaching back in time to warn themselves of XCOM and the unworthiness of humanity! Perhaps in this life the Uber shall fall to these lesser beings. But in another, these humans shall serve a higher purpose. As a final attempt to punish XCOM for their audacity, the Uber collapses the engine core, causing a chain reaction that will generate a singularity, obliterating humanity from this existence! 

################### 

As the bridge of the Ethereal templeship collapses around him and his team, Enrique ""Delta Two"" Vasquez orders his team to evacuate. As they run towards the door out, he is overcome by a premonition. 

*A singularity forms...Big Sky crashes and burns in the templeship hanger...the sun is blocked by the bright of the singularity as it envelops the templeship...civilians are thrown about as buildings are ripped from their foundations...the lucky ones are cut to ribbons by glass and debris before being sucked into the singularity...Earth is no more, replaced by the vacuum of space...*

His eyes snap open, the bridge still stands...for now. His squadmates turn to call him onward. 

""GO!"" he shouts, sending a psychic wave to knock them clear as the doors lock shut, sealing Enrique in with his fate. 

He never thought of himself a hero. Enrique was ever only a survivor. He survived that terrible day when Delta squad first encountered the alien menace. He survived the Chrysalids turning his friends into zombies. He survived that Berserker that came out of nowhere and would have ripped his head off were it not for a successful overwatch. He survived carrying a team of rookies as more experienced operatives cooked in MELD vats and underwent MEC augmentation to increase Earth's chances of survival. He survived when XCOM was invaded, and the governments of the world almost left them in the rubble were it not for the Commander talking them down. He survived sitting in that damn tube for a week and a half to see if he had psychic potential. He just survived the successful elimination of the ""Uber Ethereal."" 

Now how was he going to survive this? 

Enrique quickly ran over to the psionic terminal, it rumbled and shook as the templeship began to implode. He reached out, like he was putting hands on the psychic weave of the cosmos. 

""Go up, you damn UFO, GO UP!!!"" 

As he strained his mind and braced his legs, Enrique could feel the ship moving spaceward. 

""Just explode, just explode, just explode, just explode, just explode-"" 

He chanted it like a mantra, his thoughts becoming more base as he pushed deeper into the psionic weave. The bridge buckled and shook as the ornamentation cracked and fell around him. 

""EVACEVACEVACEVACEVA-"" 

His eyes shot open once more, the darkness of space meeting his view as the ship gave one final heave before stopping just outside of the atmosphere. His body crackled with psionic energy, and in an instant he heard himself say 

""GO!""

Character Concept 12: UNSC Infinity,"Faction:

United Nations Space Command

&amp;#x200B;

Class:

Infinity-class super carrier

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

The UNSC Infinity was the lead ship of the Infinity-class super carriers built by the UNSC. She was the largest ship ever built by humanity, and incorporated technology reverse engineered from both the Covenant and the Forerunners. Though not completed in time to serve in the Human-Covenant War, she would see action in the post-war galaxy as the new flagship of the UNSC fleet. She possessed multiple MAC Guns, along with a wide assortment of missiles, cannons, and point defense turrets. She even could carry up to 10 frigates inside her hull to be deployed at any time.

Infinity's first real action would be immediately following the end of the Human-Covenant War, when she aided the Arbiter in dealing with Covenant holdouts on the Elite homeworld of Sanghelios. She would be fully commissioned into the Navy in 2557, and given the mission to explore and locate undiscovered Halo arrays, along with other Forerunner installations. During one such expedition, she would detect a distress signal from the planet Requiem. Upon arrival, the Infinity would be sucked inside the shield world and crash land, only to then be attacked by both Covenant Remnants and the planet's defense machines known as Prometheans, led by a Forerunner leader known as the Didact.

After being saved by the Master Chief, the Infinity would leave the planet, but without the legendary Spartan following a tense confrontation between him and the ship's Captain. Infinity would return to Earth, where her captain was dismissed and replaced with Infinity's first officer. When the Didact's personal vessel arrived to attack Earth, Infinity would lead the UNSC fleet in orbit against the Forerunner dreadnought. Her main guns would open a hole in the ship for the Master Chief to slip inside, and kill the Didact and destroy the dreadnought.

Infinity would later return to Requiem to both study the shield world, and fight the Covenant Remnant occupying it. She would narrowly escape when the warlord Jul 'Mdama set the planet on a collision course with a nearby sun.

Sometime later, Infinity would investigate a series of attacks on human colonies. These attacks were soon revealed as a plan by a renegade Cortana to establish an AI led dominion over the galaxy using Forerunner Guardian machines. Infinity would narrowly escape Earth as a Guardian set off an EMP that shutdown the entire planet. Infinity would later rally with other suriving UNSC forces to formulate a plan to counter Cortana and her Created faction.

During a mission to Zeta Halo, Infinity would be ambushed by the Banished. She would be disabled within four minutes, forcing her crew to evacuate to the ring below. Her final fate after this is currently unknown.

&amp;#x200B;

Namesake:

Infinity is named after the concept of infinity, meaning boundless, endless, or beyond any number possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Stat Spread:

Infinity has the highest ATK, DEF, and HP pool of any UNSC ship. Her Forerunner engines grant her above average speed, however her immense size means her maneuverability is fairly low.

&amp;#x200B;

Rarity:

UR

&amp;#x200B;

Abilities:

* UNSC Flagship: Buff all ships in the fleet when two or more UNSC ships are present
* Frigate Carrier: Summon several mass produced ships in front of the vanguard. Ships will remain until HP is depleted
* MAC Gun: Every 100 seconds, fire a projectile to cause 3x damage to an enemy

&amp;#x200B;

Personality:

Despite being the most powerful ship in the UNSC, Infinity is very reluctant in regards to being the flagship. This stems from several events over her relatively short career where she was nearly destroyed and/or boarded by enemy forces. In her mind, these events show she's not worthy of being a flagship, resulting in low self-esteem. As such, she often gives the leadership decisions to either Pillar of Autumn or Spirit of Fire. Not helping matters is the limbo her unfinished sister, Eternity, seems to be in.

One thing Infinity really enjoys however is cooking. Her many exploration missions have given her an appreciation for new and unique ingredients which she often uses in her dishes. Many of her meals seem strange at first, but more often than not turn out incredibly delicious. But like with her role as a flagship, she is her own worst critic with her cooking, should something go wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Quotes:

* Acquisition: I am UNSC Infinity, flagship of the fleet. Though I really wish I wasn't.
* Secretary (Idle) 1: Will they ever finish my sister? Or will she be yet another one of those ships that never left their shipyard?
* Secretary (Idle) 2: Spirit of Fire should be the flagship. She has way more experience than me.
* Secretary (Idle) 3: I made some snacks in case you get hungry, Commander.
* Secretary (Touch): Do you have something to tell me?
* Secretary (Special Touch): Y-you PEVERT! \*slap\*
* Skill activation: Light is green!
* Affinity (Disappointment): I was right. I am a failure.
* Affinity (Stranger): Why'd they name me the flagship. Just because I'm the biggest one?
* Affinity (Friendly): You... you really think I'm a good ship?
* Affinity (Like): Commander, I've come up with some new items for the Mess Hall menu. Want to try some?
* Affinity (Love): I... I made this just for you. It, uh, got a little burnt on the edges. But it should be fine!
* Oath: You'd pick someone like me to be with you forever? I...I....thank you.....
* Sortie (Pillar of Autumn): It's your show, Autumn.
* Sortie (In Amber Clad): Please don't rush ahead!
* Sortie (Forward Unto Dawn): Don't push yourself to hard.
* Sortie (Spirit of Fire): Maybe you should lead. I'd only make more mistakes.
* Sortie (Enterprise): Can you teach me how to be a perfect flagship?
* Sortie (Prinz Eugen): Want to share recipes after this?

&amp;#x200B;

Appearance:

Infinity appears as a tall woman in her early twenties, with long black hair and green eyes. She wears an armor padded version of the UNSC Navy service uniform, with the tunic having integrated body armor, along with an armored pauldron on her left shoulder, and additional protection along her spine.

Her rigging consists of her hull split down the middle, with the two haves split themselves. Her forward sections float at shoulder level on each side, with her rear sections holding her engines floating over her legs.

&amp;#x200B;

A/N:

And that's it for the Halo ships. For now anyway.

I wanted to cover the most well known ships first before expanding out to ships shown and mentioned in Halo's expanded universe like the UNSC Gettysburg from the Halo: First Strike novel. It'll probably be a while before we get back to Halo, but we will come back.

Infinity's quotes were a bit hard for me to write because while I wanted to show her as having self-esteem issues, I didn't want her to sound like she was whining all the time.

Small confession: I have not yet played Halo Infinite. I was fairly reluctant regarding playing the game when it was first announced because I didn't like where 343 was taking Halo's story with Guardians. I didn't like how they seemingly killed Cortana in 4 only to have her come back as the villain in 5. I do plan on playing it at some point, given what I've heard about it.

Next time we leave the universe of Halo behind and go to the universe of a cult classic tv series that was cut too short: Space: Above and Beyond. She was one of humanity's best warships, leading the ongoing fight against the mysterious Chigs and their desire to destroy humanity. Next up, it's the John F. Kennedy class Naval Space Carrier, USS Saratoga!",AzureLane,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/ssj7ki/character_concept_12_unsc_infinity/,Fanfiction,Shadowrunner724,ssj7ki,/r/AzureLane/comments/ssj7ki/character_concept_12_unsc_infinity/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/ssj7ki/character_concept_12_unsc_infinity/,7,2022-02-14
The Stories of Love,"Azur Lane Gazette

Lovers Tell Their Stories

Explore the stories of how the bases' couples came to be

by Aoba on February 14th

  With so much having happened this past year, the start of the Azur Lane Little League teams, Graf Zeppelin being involved in the local civilian schools, Purity joining the fleet, the Forged in Fire competition and even the recent newest additions to the base, this is a day to take a look at something even more special.

  In celebration of the day reserved for love, I interviewed the bases' most famous and most unlikely couples to tell their story on how their romance started. Some of these stories were very cute, and I wish I could fit every detail into this article. 

  I had started interviewing Shikikan as well, but realizing how much space that would take up, I felt it best not to include what I have collected.

  Our first story is the biggest power couple on base, the leader of the Iron Blood, the lovely Bismarck and the pride of the Royal Navy, the eloquent Hood. They are four months away from celebrating their first year anniversary.

Me: ""How did the two of you first meet?""

Bismark: ""It was at the early stages of our fight against the Sirens. I was leading a fleet and we got an S.O.S. call requesting help. It was Hood, Sheffield and Edinburgh, they were ambushed. After we rescued them, Hood and I became friends.""

  Me: ""Okay, and when did you both realize you had deeper feelings for each other?""

  Hood: ""It was actually thanks to Miss Prinz Eugen of all people. Miss Bismarck and I were coming back from seeing a romantic movie. She approached us and started making comments on how we were on a date, how cute we looked together and that sort of stuff. Her words triggered something in both of our minds and we started seeing each other in a different light.""

  When we finished, Bismarck and Hood left with intertwined arms and fingers. I also would like to wish Bismarck a very happy birthday today.

  Moving on, I interviewed the Princes of Azur Lane. The drunk, flirty tease Prinz Eugen and the strict, focused Prince of Wales, who is also a foil to Prinz Eugen's flirtatious nature.

  Me: ""What did you do on your first date?""

  Prince of Wales: ""We went out to one of the nearby islands and had a picnic. It was actually Eugen's idea. She surprised me and made all of the food herself, we sat and ate while watching the sunset.""

  Me: ""What is one thing you like the most about Wales?""

  Prinz Eugen: ""Hmm… I would have to say how fun she can be in the sheets, in the kitchen, the shower or anywhere she is."" 

  I couldn't help but laugh at Prinz Eugen's reaction after Wales leaned in and whispered something in Eugen's ear. As of the publishing of this paper, I still wonder what could cause such a look of horror.

  The next couple I interviewed was the sweet, kind and caring Arizona and the beautiful, powerful Tirpitz. 

  Me: ""What was the first thing you thought when you met?""

Tirpitz: ""How much I wanted to be like her. I have heard of her history, and she talked about how it was affecting her on my first day in Bremerton's group. But her determination to be stronger, to protect her loved ones, I wanted to have that same drive even if I was antisocial and lacked confidence in myself.""

  Me: ""Who was the one to ask the other out?""

  Arizona: ""It was actually Tirpitz who asked me out. Seems Bismarck, U- 556 and even Scharnhorst encouraged her to do so after she spent some time talking about me for the upteenth time. Seems Tirpitz had developed quite a crush on me.""

  I watched as a heavily blushing Tirpitz was led away by a giggling Arizona, talking about going to get some spaghetti for a romantic dinner.

  My next couple to interview was the confident tomboy, Cleveland and her Juliet, Helena.

  Me: ""Is it true that you consider your first date the military ball you both first attended?"" 

  Cleveland: ""Yes. Before that I enjoyed spending what time I could with Helena before her sisters would get overprotective of her.""

  Me: ""What are some activities you enjoy doing together?""

  Helena: ""Cooking and taking care of bonsai. I was surprised when Cleveland showed me her bonsai collection and revealed her interest in them along with her more girly side.""

  Cleveland carried a reluctant, embarrassed Helena out of the room princess style. The pair exit into a hallway filled with Cleveland's and Helena's sisters, and what I heard was a lot of arguing but it somehow ended with Montpelier and Phoenix getting jostled and knocked to the floor, Montpelier on top of Phoenix.

  Shaking my head, I open the door wide as the two sets of sisters leave, continuing their bickering as my next guests enter. The self proclaimed pirate queen and second in command of the new Iris Dominion, Jean Bart, who leads in her exotic looking wench, Massachusetts.

  Me: ""What was your reaction to seeing the other again after so long and your history?""

  Jean Bart: ""I was angry, I felt like I was being mocked and constantly reminded of my failure. It was my sister and Commandant who helped change my perception of the situation, along with a five hour patrol that was just the two of us.""

  Me: ""Who is it that usually decides what you do and where you go when going out on a date?""

  Massachusetts: ""We try to alternate who gets to decide what we do. We think it is the most fair way to do things and make them equal.""

  Before Massachusetts and Jean Bart left, they fed each other a heart shaped chocolate piece, which resulted in a quick kiss.

  The gem of Italy, Littorio and the buxom lady of light Illustrious were next, and I must say, their interview was... interesting to say the least. I was expecting their interview to be a bit raw, but even I had to stop for a while after they finished.

Me: ""What was the most surprising thing you have done on a date?""

Illustrious: ""It was during our date in Venice. Our very first evening there, after a very nice dinner and ride on a gondola, Littorio surprised me with a sunset ride in one of her IMAM RO .43s.""

Me: ""What has been your most memorable date so far?""

Littorio: ""Easily had to be our date in Venice. How beautiful the city is and then the beautiful Signorina just added to the beauty. It was also [editor felt this part was better left out due to the nature of the content.]

  Littorio just smiled as she slipped some wine, sitting comfortably while I recovered from how detailed her story was. Illustrious was just blushing but leaned in and turned the tide with just a few whispered words in Littorio's ear.

  After an hour-long break, the next couple I interviewed was the number one, hyperactive duo known as Oklahoma and Karlsruhe.

  Me: ""What were the circumstances of your first meeting?""

  Karlsruhe: ""I wanted to participate in the first ever volleyball tournament, but my sisters were deployed on a patrol and I was having a hard time finding a partner. That is when I ran into Oklahoma who was trying to encourage Tennessee to play with her. Tennessee was already teaming with her sister, California. She did, however, suggest that Okie and I team up.""

  Me: ""What made you decide to try going out on a date?""

Oklahoma: ""Karli and I were planning on going out to have fun as friends, but Commander set up a surprise date with Karli, I was invited to join after telling Commander our plans. Commander made sure the plans were changed so that I was included. During the date, Commander commented on how cute Karli and I looked together and suggested we try going out on a date ourselves.""

  After I dismissed them, the pair ran off like a pair of Zeros flying at full throttle, saying something about not wanting to miss a movie or their date at Chuck E Cheese.

   I next interviewed the most unlikely couple on base, the Black Princess herself, South Dakota and ""The World's Cutest"" Admiral Graf Spee.

  Me: ""Your story is one of the most unusual out of all of the couples, that it was either luck or fate, yet you have managed to make it work. What exactly happened?"" 

  Admiral Graf Spee: ""Deutschland pushed me gently into the crowd, saying I had to partake during the garter belt toss. Well, her push was a bit more forceful than she meant it to be and I accidentally bumped into Shigure, knocking her down. When I stood back up, I bumped someone else's hand and the garter belt landed on my head.""

  Me: ""It is unfortunate that Gangut failed to arrive for the first double date that was setup for the four of you, but what made you choose Admiral Graf Spee over Aquila?""

  South Dakota: ""It had to do with personality. Do not get me wrong, Aquila is very bubbly and funny, and I hope that she finds someone if she wants to, but Spee reminded me of myself, and I understood how hard it was for her to open up in that situation. We started out first as friends.""

  It was a bit cute watching Spee blush after South Dakota whispered something in her ear before leaving. 

  The final couple I interviewed was the bubbly Repulse and the glory-hungry Scharnhorst.

  Me: ""While Graf Spee's and South Dakota's relationship is the most unusual, yours is probably the most secretive. What exactly happened?""

  Repulse: ""Scharny, Renown, Gneisenau and I were sent out on a convoy mission with Bataan and Ryūhō. We ran into a bad storm, where a siren fleet ambushed us. I got separated in the confusion and was taking fire from three siren battleships. It was thanks to poor Cu- Potato that I was saved from a broadside at Scharny's command. She even took another broadside meant for me while the third battleship missed after Scharnhorst pushed me out of the way. They still managed to finish off two of the battleships despite the damage they took."" 

  Me: ""Wow, I didn't know you were capable of being that brave, Scharnhorst. What went through your mind at that point in time, and after you rescued the fair damsel?""

Scharnhorst: ""I wasn't really thinking, it was more instinct. I knew Potato and I could easily survive that pounding on our own, but the combined attack would have surely sunk Repulse. As for what I thought of my actions after the attack, I was confused as to why I did that. The only answer I gave myself was that Potato was the first to find her, and warned me of what was happening. She may be a member of the inferior Royal Navy, but she is still an ally, and I don't want to see an ally sunk or hurt.""

  After the interview, Repulse tackled and nose-nuzzled a blushing Scharnhorst before they left. 

  I would like to again thank each couple who has participated in this interview and told their special stories. For those wanting to find their own happiness and want to take that risk, don't be afraid. I hope you have just as good of luck in finding that special person.",AzureLane,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/ss7vpk/the_stories_of_love/,Fanfiction,Moonshade44,ss7vpk,/r/AzureLane/comments/ss7vpk/the_stories_of_love/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureLane/comments/ss7vpk/the_stories_of_love/,13,2022-02-14
"Why do People think Lawbringer is ""Viable""?","Dont get me wrong. He's not as weak as some people claim but he's been consistently D-Tier for a considerable amount of time now. Even BarakYeet made a Video about why he doesnt play Lawbringer.

He cant engage at all, the match pretty much becomes a boring staring contest and his Punishes are only a little above average.

The moment someone suggests changes to Lawbringer the automatic answer is ""Oh, you're just a Lawbringer Main with a Victim Complex"".

Their points arent really as valid as they think it is and everything they say boils down to ""Lawbringer has Insane punishes"", ""Just Parry bro, ""He's a defensive character so its fine"".

And yet, Conq who is a very defensive hero and was doing fine got a rework Testing Grounds.

Jorm, LB and Shaolin are consistently D-Tier at both Dominion and Duels and yet no Rework in sight.

In all honesty if you think Lawbringer is ""Fine as is"" either 1 (You dont play Lawbringer) 2 (You hate him just because its trendy and edgy to) or 3 (You just hate the LB mains and are fine with him being Bottom Tier). No, a person asking for a Lawbringer Buff isnt a Low Level Dipshit by default you just assumed that. And no, Lawbringers Punish arent as easy to get as you think they are. At Higher Levels Lawbringer can easily get parry baited and cannot get any offense in so dont even try to make the argument of ""But he's Viable at Higher Levels"".",forhonor,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/ssd2id/why_do_people_think_lawbringer_is_viable/,Discussion,Jaesaun,ssd2id,/r/forhonor/comments/ssd2id/why_do_people_think_lawbringer_is_viable/,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/ssd2id/why_do_people_think_lawbringer_is_viable/,68,2022-02-14

Enticing your players back to Undermountain,"I am having trouble steering my players back to Undermountain. For some context, my players and I have been playing this module for a couple of years (preceded by WD: Dragon Heist) and we have explored Levels 1-6 and the dweomercore. Initially my players threw themselves at Undermountain without me having to provide much solid character motivation. They were curious and excited to explore, and it was compelling to watch their characters change as Undermountain unrelentingly defended themselves from their advance. They surfaced multiple times and with every narrow escape their desire to explore has waned. That being said, we have run some pretty awesome “refresher” side adventurers that have recharged their batteries and renewed their confidence. They are currently on a side adventure featuring the high captains of Luskan, Dagult Neverember and the Neverwinter Navy, Bregan D’Aerth, and the Arcane Brotherhood. What would you do to tie everything back in? How did you convince your players to seriously try to battle Halaster for his dominion? Any ideas are welcome and I can elaborate if requested.

Galdriel is a warrior,"I keep seeing the complaint that Galadriel's character is being changed into a ""strong female character"" or ""warrior princess"". This is actually how she is originally described in the Unfinished Tales.

I'll let Tolkien speak for himself:
""""Galadriel was greatest of the Noldor, except Feanor maybe, though she was wiser than he""

""Her mother-name was Nerwen (man-maiden), and she grew to be tall beyond the measure even of the women of the Noldor; she was strong of body, mind, and will, a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the Eldar in the days of their youth.""

""she fought fiercely against Feanor in defence of her mothers kin""

""she looked upon the dwarves also with the eye of a commander, seeing in them the finest warriors to pit against the Orcs.""

""[Sauron] perceived at once that Galadriel would be his chief adversary and obstacle""

After refusing pardon for her part in the rebellion against the Valar: ""it was not until the two long ages more had passed, when at last all that she had desired in her youth came to her hand, the Ring of Power and the dominion of Middle-earth of which she had dreamed, that her wisdom was full grown and she rejected it, and passing the last test departed from Middle-earth for ever.""

Young Galadriel, according to Tolkien, is angry, prideful, highly athletic and wise, thinks like a commander, joins in many battles in the first and second age, is always suspicious of the return of evil, perceives and threatens the evil plans of Sauron, and has an unfulfilled desire for ""the dominion of Middle-earth"".

Winter's Dominion,"The image of the blackbird on a snow-laden cedar limb    
is proof that black and white are not opposites.    
These forms- bird and tree- are just different    
shadows cast against the evening.  

It is believed that every snowflake is unique in some way,    
but a glance at the bleached landscape reveals this    
to be untrue. The same flake fell countless times today,    
smothering the world with perfect copies of itself.  

In a more forgiving climate, the glow of a fire    
might be used to temper the frost. The icicles that    
hang from these branches know nothing of this fact.    
There is no hope for warmth when everything is frozen.  

All that moves is the icy wind that disturbs the blackbird,    
frenzies the snow, and severs the icicles. The wind, subject to    
unknowable whims, shapes and reshapes the world.  It is the only    
sign of life for miles. Winter has devoured everything else.

Imagine that Lucasfilm is in charge of Jurassic World: Dominion. How would the movie play out?,"Description: It's been 4 years since the dinosaurs at Lockwood Manor were released into the wilderness. In the time since then, Biosyn has risen to the top by Lewis Dodgson. It is revealed that Dodgson has orchestrated every single event (the failure of Jurassic Park, the San Diego incident, Eric's disappearance on Isla Sorna, Jurassic World's downfall, the volcanic eruption on Isla Nublar) and now possesses an army of 10,000+ Indominus Rex that he announces he will unleash upon the world, with 16 hours remaining. It's up to the new heroes and Ian Malcom, Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler to put an end to Dodgson in the epic conclusion to the Jurassic saga. 

\*Snippet from the reveal of Lewis Dodgson\*

Owen: We've decoded the intel from the Biosyn spy and it conforms the worst... somehow Lewis Dodgson returned. He's been planning his revenge. His followers have been creating something for years. The largest army of dinosaurs the planet has ever known. He calls it the Dino Order. In 16 hours, attacks on all cities begin. Dodgson and his army have been hiding in unknown regions. 

Zia: Wait, do we believe this? How is this possible?

Franklin: Dark science, cloning, secrets only Ingen knew.

Claire : So Dodgson's been out there all this time, pulling the strings.

Ellie: Always. In the shadows. From the very beginning.

Ian: If we want to stop Dodgson, we must find him. We must find Alan Grant.

\*Alan Grant's characterization\*

Alan Grant is a recluse that lives on Isla Sorna and refuses the call to duty when Claire looks for him. Claire presents Grant with his long-lost raptor claw and Grant proceeds to toss the claw over his shoulder, storming off. Grant milks a dinosaurs that has nipples and gulps down its milk as Claire watches. Grant tells her that 15 years ago, he considered murdering Ellie Sattler's children while babysitting them, freaking out when he sees them playing with dinosaur toys and when they say they want to become a dinosaur. He blames John Hammond for everything that has happened and proclaims that it's time for paleontologists to end. Eventually, Grant makes a sudden appearance during a final showdown between the Biosyn and our heroes. He does the most paleontologist thing ever by allowing himself to be devoured by a Giganotosaurus, allowing time for the heroes to make their escape. In a twist reveal, Grant has been an android, with the real Alan Grant still on Isla Sorna remotely controlling the android. For no reason at all, Alan Grant dies.

What is stopping Warden from being meta in 4sies ?,"Hey everyone, hope you're doing alright.

I'll list Warden's most problematic issues in 4s to my knowledge, feel free to fill in what I didn't think off please. This isn't a rework, but I do make suggestions that I'd love to discuss : I'm trying to put into perspective everything Warden could use to become viable in 4s, and would appreciate some help.

&amp;#x200B;

**General shortcomings :** 

**1)** *Bad feats* : feats are a key factor in whether or not a char will be part of the meta. Most of Warden's feats are not team oriented besides his Stalwart Banner and Morale Booster T4s (catapult aside, as it's useless in its current state), and pale in comparison to the popular meta feats (fireflask+fury, phallynx, etc). His feats need to be fully reworked to serve a better team purpose. I've come up with some ideas myself, if you're interested (it would make the post too long) I can post it in the comments.  

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** *Underwhelming hitboxes* : being able to damage enemies in a large area with a single attack, especially a target swapped unblockable one, is part of what makes or breaks a great team fighter char. Although Warden's side heavy hitboxes have been looked at, they are still pretty bad (understatement) compared to the likes of JJ or Raider. There are two options here. Either give Warden much better hitboxes (and forward movement) to be able to reach enemies in team fights without being too easily interrupted, or keep those hitboxes and give his finisher heavies HA so he can trade.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** *Stamina costs* : Going out of stamina in a 2v2 means defeat most of the time. The enemy duo will gank your partner without you being able to peel, and he'll end up really low or dead, and then the same will happen to you. Warden suffers from very bad stamina consumption overall. I would suggest increasing his stamina pool from 120 to 130, decreasing his zone stamina cost from 50 to 35, decreasing his heavy feints cost, and giving him soft feints to GB on opener and finisher heavies.

**4)** *Recoveries :* having good recoveries in team fights is essential not to be punished on whiffs (even though your teammates should in theory be there to peel for you). I don't think giving Warden dodge recovery cancels similar to what reworked heroes and new heroes have been getting would work, especially because the latter have dodge attacks with low GB vulnerability while Wraden has high GB vulnerability on his side dodge bash (making dodge recovery cancels on him essentially useless). Therefore, I suggest using what is already there : making the chained bash on heavy attack whiffs a lot less GB vulnerable. That way, it would work as a dodge recovery cancel (since you can cancel the bash afterwards), while also making Warden's chained offense better.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Specific shortcomings :**

**1)** *Lack of opener variety* : shoulder bash is certainly a strong opener in itself, but that's literally all Warden has.  I suggest giving Warden's heavy openers an option to be soft feinted into omnidirectional 400ms enhanced lights that can chain into his shoulder bash mixup or finisher (it would essentially be the same mechanic as Shaman soft feints, since heavies can also be soft feinted to GB, but without the bleed of course. The animations for the soft feints could be recycled from HL's pommel strikes in OF). This change is there to help him in quick 1v1 situations that one might face in Dominion. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** *Shoulder bash mixup weaknesses :* all the recent reworks and new heroes have demonstrated that the devs are pushing for strong, not easily punishable or interruptible, offense. Warden could use some of those elements to help his shoulder bash mixup, whether that would be in duels or 4sies. 

In terms of 1v1s, I suggest not making level 1 shoulder bash punishable with a GB, the reason being that now that almost all heroes have gotten side dodge attacks, level 1 should force the defender to make a read that the Warden will commit to level 1 if he wants to get a punish on the whiffed bash. Such change would mean taking out stamina pause from Warden's bashes (not to make his mixup too oppressive). 

In terms of 4sies, shoulder bash mixup is easily interruptible in team fights at the moment. All it takes to interrupt it is an attack/bash on level 1 or 2 that can be done on reaction, and Warden is rendered useless in 4s. It would be interesting to mess with the HA timing (maybe have it applied on level 2), as well as making it super armor. The top heavy attack follow up after level 3 should also be given HA, to guarantee damage in team fights. This new shoulder bash would overall give Warden the ability to trade. Stamina consumption for the mixup could be increased not to make it too overpowered, on the condition that the stamina costs listed above are taken care of. 

To add depth to the mixup, Warden could benefit from having the undodgeable property on his forward dodge attack, in order to punish target swapped dodge attacks from the enemies on read.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** *Lack of defensive options :* as I've already mentioned, side dodge attacks have become the norm in this new meta, and serve the purpose that OS used to in the past, which is defending against external UBs by target swapping one's dodge attack (to cover both feint to GB and dodge the UB if it's committed). 

Giving a side dodge attack to Warden would feel out of character for him, but giving his side dodge bash more GB invulnerability would make it too strong as a defensive tool. The compromise would be to give side dodge bash more Iframes, to help warden dodge target swapped attacks in team fights, while getting him into the strong reworked mixup I suggested. 

Since I've argued against Warden getting a proper side dodge attack, I feel it is necessary to give him more defensive tools. I suggest we give him omnidirectional CC lights, that would essentially fill the role of a side dodge attack on blockable attacks. Of course, that would mean removing the guaranteed follow up light from the top CC light. The CC lights would chain into the shoulder bash mixup or finisher.

&amp;#x200B;

**PS :** obviously, the chained lights should be made 500ms.",CompetitiveForHonor,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ssc6m8/what_is_stopping_warden_from_being_meta_in_4sies/,Discussion,Letsbalanceheroes,ssc6m8,/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ssc6m8/what_is_stopping_warden_from_being_meta_in_4sies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveForHonor/comments/ssc6m8/what_is_stopping_warden_from_being_meta_in_4sies/,26,2022-02-14

"20 for 10, my top twenty New Japan matches of the ten years under Bushiroad | #11: Hiromu Takahashi (c) vs. Kushida (IWGP Junior Heavyweight championship • Dominion • June 11, 2017)","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dopschzvzrh81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=529f09fc14db611c85e585231ad8f886e1befb39

**\[** [**Intro**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdTMOEWWvY) **|** [**Match**](https://njpwworld.com/p/s_series_00442_1_06) **\]**

THE feud blow-off.

Golden Age NJPW puts together four otherworldly arcs, including the sensational story told with the juniors from late 2016 to mid-2017. The best one in years in a division that hasn't reached the same highs since. It’s also the story among the four with a definitive resolution, thus with the most satisfying conclusion. Part of the brilliance lies in the paths followed by the participants.

In the red corner stands Hiromu. Seven months ago, he comes back from excursion on a bang. In his first singles match, he wins the championship decisively at Wrestle Kingdom. He takes the company by storm with his all-out blitz style. He is relentless, reckless, insane... No one has ever seen something like it and no one knows how to deal with it. The Ticking Time Bomb nickname suits him perfectly: his high-impact moveset can end a discussion anytime. While his peers have a more traditional approach with gradual escalation, he throws bombs from the get-go. He benefits from the novelty and is invincible, until he meets an old foe during the Best of the Super Jr. 24: Dragon Lee. He defeats him soundly earlier in the year at The New Beginning in Osaka but the *luchador* knows him better than anyone else and inflicts him his first loss. It cracks Hiromu's armor and the competition notices it. The unstoppable force is human; the unstoppable force can be beat. And he will be again, twice, and miss the final. Come Dominion, his aura and confidence aren't as suffocating. He appears more vulnerable than ever.

In the blue corner stands Kushida. The junior Ace rules the division until the fateful Tokyo Dome encounter. Crushed on the biggest stage, starts for him a downward spiral. At Sakura Genesis, Hiromu buries his soul six feet under when he squashes him in less than two minutes in the semi main of the third or fourth biggest show of the year (first time the juniors reached this spot). On the occasion, Kushida tries his opponent’s method and jumps him before the bell, like Hiromu did at Wrestle Kingdom. A mistake because he is a cerebral guy who needs a plan and it backfires spectacularly. Affected psychologically, it’s also a period where he struggles with concussions, he needs to regroup. Part of the recovery begins in the United States with the ROH Television title. Come the Best of the Super Jr., his groove still isn't back. 0-2, his Hoverboard Lock doesn’t do the job anymore. A trend started in January and in April: when Hiromu reaches for the ropes while about to being locked (Wrestle Kingdom) or locked (Sakura Genesis) in the move, Kushida rolls back towards the middle of the ring but Hiromu uses the momentum to free himself by muscling him up for a Time Bomb attempt. So Kushida invents a new finisher to transition away from the counter, Back to the Future, and gets on the board against Bushi, an old foe too. He rallies and reaches the final where he beats Ospreay, another heated rival, with an assist from an avalanche Back to the Future. Come Dominion, Kushida is a new man as shown by his sparkling, one-off gear. With a lot of momentum, he is once again at the top of his game.

Despite his recent slump, Hiromu remains a constant threat. A wounded animal is the most dangerous. Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion in general and don't ever overlook his lethal arsenal specifically. His explosive, high-octane offense puts perpetual pressure. Unlike Omega whose basic stuff looks too devastating for its own good, it’s by design. He throws bombs left and right, from start to finish. It’s excruciating, painful and fruitful. With the pro-LIJ (but still split on Naito) smarky Osaka crowd, the odds are stacked against Kushida. For him, it’s like being on the road for a game seven or a conference championship, which makes for an even bigger uphill battle.

He is in for a fight and the long run. You can’t fully prepare for what Hiromu brings to the table. You can’t predict the unpredictable. Kushida can only contemplate hypothetic scenarios beforehand and be ready if/when they happen. He knows he must hang in there, as risky as it sounds, for the windows to open because they open inevitably. It’s not pretty, it sure isn’t easy. But hey, it’s the challenge of his life. Make it or break it.

Therefore, he grinds. Every single second. Poised, he deals with every situation that kills him previously more effectively. When the bell rings, his hatred pushes him straight into a strike-fest. His drive quickly takes over and he emulates Dragon Lee’s opening in his Best of the Super Jr. win. He initiates a slap exchange, something Hiromu loves to do from time to time and something that usually shreds his opponent’s chest badly. Not tonight. Kushida doesn’t necessarily win the flurries but doesn’t lose them either. Actually, Hiromu is the one who retreats.

Kushida doesn’t shy away from the bomb trading. He also follows Hiromu’s non-traditional pace where the frantic rhythm to start slows down as the match progresses. Himself thinks outside the box: early dive, dropkick onto the crowd, two punches instead of one at the end. In the preceding months, he tries to extinguish the fire with water and fails so now, he fights fire with fire. A more aggressive, borderline sadistic demeanor is part of the solution to overcome a swarming antagonist finally, and part of the effect this antagonist has had on him since Wrestle Kingdom: he broke him mentally on top of the physical beat-downs. He has a direction and follows it as well as possible. He sticks to the arm because that’s what gave him his name. He is also proactive in a smarter way as he brings the wood but not blindly. He got embarrassed trying to beat Hiromu at his own game while playing Hiromu’s game in the Sumo Hall; here, he matches aggression and boldness with his own rules since he controls his emotions. He sees many tricks coming. Even if he can’t avoid them all, those that score don’t overwhelm him, being more familiar with them.

When Hiromu quickly goes for the Time Bomb, he manages to escape. When Hiromu tries to set up the devastating top rope Cazadora from the Tokyo Dome, the arm work bails Kushida out. He avoids the fatal Sunset Powerbomb and continuing one of the lingering themes, he survives when it connects. When Hiromu becomes the first to clog the Hoverboard-Lock-to-Back-to-the-Future pipeline, he doesn’t crumble and stays committed to the arm, anticipating another opportunity down the line; after all, this opportunity could come, should come, will come. When Hiromu steamrolls him with his finishing sequence and loads him on the top rope for more punishment, he exploits the breach originated from the champion’s pride to hit an oh-so satisfying equalizer: the avalanche Back to the Future. The super move helped him to get back in contention, now it helps him to get back from the dead. Double down, momentum reset, Kushida has Hiromu right where he wants him. He has lived through everything that led to his previous downfalls, has worn Hiromu down in the process and still has some energy left in him. Do or die. Pushed further than ever before by someone he rag-dolled twice, insecurity, panic and specter of defeat cloud Hiromu’s mind, who loses his cool during the ensuing forearm trading. At this moment, Kushida knows he is almost there. He is in full control of his destiny. Backing-up the physical dimension by mental toughness, up to the task at every level, he has won the war of attrition and just needs to convert his efforts into a W.",njpw,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/njpw/comments/ss7je5/20_for_10_my_top_twenty_new_japan_matches_of_the/,,Joshi_Fan,ss7je5,/r/njpw/comments/ss7je5/20_for_10_my_top_twenty_new_japan_matches_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/njpw/comments/ss7je5/20_for_10_my_top_twenty_new_japan_matches_of_the/,0,2022-02-14

**Game type:** Homebrew. We follow most rules in the book but will be flexible with some in order to create a better experience for the players. Creatures, lore, side quests, main story line is all homebrew and custom made. All character back stories are important and will affect the overall story. Every major decision, success or failure of the players will influence the story. I spend an average of 20-30 hours a week updating and creating the game.

\-Yawning portal campaign with a homebrew main story.

\-Lore heavy world-Fun and Unique fight mechanics (Boss actions, lair mechanics, using the environment) with multiple ways to handle each encounter. Winning or failing missions will impact the overall story! Your choices matter!!!

\-Resource gathering on maps and item crafting (potions, poisons, armor etc).

\-Sanity system for those ""holy shit moments""

\-2500+ Custom made NPCs and 250+ high quality homebrew maps.

\-Animated high quality Spells that can be placed on the map.

\-Epic Music for combat, ambiance and perception cues.

\-Your character's background matters and will be a main focus in the game!

\-Game Recaps are written in discord and we do a debrief at the beginning of every game. We also have chapter recaps for new players so you can jump right in and be caught up.

\-Personal character pages on discord for your use.-Special holiday quests (Christmas, Halloween etc). We also do background flashback quests and also Goblin squad quests where players get to goof off as goblins on crazy missions lol.

\-Custom made inspiration deck that can be used at any time. Inspiration cards are given to players who do something cool in game or make people laugh in discord.

\-Combat, status and concentration mods on roll20 to help players play turns faster.-Lots of homebrew riddles, puzzles and intro pages to hint at what's coming next.

\-Dynamic lighting (this means that spells, torches, campfires etc give off light) and you can only see what your character can see.-A DM that never cancels games!

**Setting:** The campaign is 5e and called the Yawning portal campaign. We have weaved every dungeon of the campaign into an overall homebrew story which is heavily impacted by the player's choices and backgrounds.

**Story:** The group is currently trying to unravel the mystery behind the Zentharim who are actively kidnaping and infecting prominent members of society with brain slugs.

The group is currently trying to unravel the mystery behind an unknown faction who are actively kidnapping and infecting prominent members of society with brain slugs.

The Dominion empire has declared war on The Great Iron Fist empire as retaliation for harvesting their sacred living trees during their most important religious ceremony called the Uroboros Festival. The Hyperian Empire to the north have closed their borders after the group publicly unveiled a plot by the league of assassins to infect and control prominent members of society with brain slugs. Meanwhile, a horde of undead is currently growing by the day, pillaging and harvesting bodies throughout it's empire. The Paladins of Tyr are splintered into two factions after the representative of the green cloaks separated from the church after their council member was caught committing heinous war crimes. Orcs have been seen crossing the impassable mountains and scouting the 3 major kingdoms, an imminent invasion is expected. If you have read this far, write the words ""mixman is the best goblin"" in your application message in order to be considered.

"20 for 10, my top twenty New Japan matches of the ten years under Bushiroad | #11: Hiromu Takahashi (c) vs. Kushida (IWGP Junior Heavyweight championship • Dominion • June 11, 2017)","&amp;#x200B;

**\[** [**Intro**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdTMOEWWvY) **|** [**Match**](https://njpwworld.com/p/s_series_00442_1_06) **\]**

THE feud blow-off.

Golden Age NJPW puts together four otherworldly arcs, including the sensational story told with the juniors from late 2016 to mid-2017. The best one in years in a division that hasn't reached the same highs since. It’s also the story among the four with a definitive resolution, thus with the most satisfying conclusion. Part of the brilliance lies in the paths followed by the participants.

In the red corner stands Hiromu. Seven months ago, he comes back from excursion on a bang. In his first singles match, he wins the championship decisively at Wrestle Kingdom. He takes the company by storm with his all-out blitz style. He is relentless, reckless, insane... No one has ever seen something like it and no one knows how to deal with it. The Ticking Time Bomb nickname suits him perfectly: his high-impact moveset can end a discussion anytime. While his peers have a more traditional approach with gradual escalation, he throws bombs from the get-go. He benefits from the novelty and is invincible, until he meets an old foe during the Best of the Super Jr. 24: Dragon Lee. He defeats him soundly earlier in the year at The New Beginning in Osaka but the *luchador* knows him better than anyone else and inflicts him his first loss. It cracks Hiromu's armor and the competition notices it. The unstoppable force is human; the unstoppable force can be beat. And he will be again, twice, and miss the final. Come Dominion, his aura and confidence aren't as suffocating. He appears more vulnerable than ever.

In the blue corner stands Kushida. The junior Ace rules the division until the fateful Tokyo Dome encounter. Crushed on the biggest stage, starts for him a downward spiral. At Sakura Genesis, Hiromu buries his soul six feet under when he squashes him in less than two minutes in the semi main of the third or fourth biggest show of the year (first time the juniors reached this spot). On the occasion, Kushida tries his opponent’s method and jumps him before the bell, like Hiromu did at Wrestle Kingdom. A mistake because he is a cerebral guy who needs a plan and it backfires spectacularly. Affected psychologically, it’s also a period where he struggles with concussions, he needs to regroup. Part of the recovery begins in the United States with the ROH Television title. Come the Best of the Super Jr., his groove still isn't back. 0-2, his Hoverboard Lock doesn’t do the job anymore. A trend started in January and in April: when Hiromu reaches for the ropes while about to being locked (Wrestle Kingdom) or locked (Sakura Genesis) in the move, Kushida rolls back towards the middle of the ring but Hiromu uses the momentum to free himself by muscling him up for a Time Bomb attempt. So Kushida invents a new finisher to transition away from the counter, Back to the Future, and gets on the board against Bushi, an old foe too. He rallies and reaches the final where he beats Ospreay, another heated rival, with an assist from an avalanche Back to the Future. Come Dominion, Kushida is a new man as shown by his sparkling, one-off gear. With a lot of momentum, he is once again at the top of his game.",njpw,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/njpw/comments/ss7hga/20_for_10_my_top_twenty_new_japan_matches_of_the/,,Joshi_Fan,ss7hga,/r/njpw/comments/ss7hga/20_for_10_my_top_twenty_new_japan_matches_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/njpw/comments/ss7hga/20_for_10_my_top_twenty_new_japan_matches_of_the/,0,2022-02-14
The Flight in the Desert by Brother Antoninus (post on r/Catholic_Poetry on Feb 17),"The last settlement scraggled out with a barbed wire fence    
And fell from sight. They crossed coyote country:    
Mesquite, sage, the bunchgrass knotted in patches;    
And there the prairie dog yapped in the valley;    
And on the high plateau the short-armed badger    
Delved his clay. But beyond that the desert,    
Raw, unslakable, its perjured dominion wholly contained    
In the sun's remorseless mandate, where the dim trail    
Died ahead in the watery horizon: God knows where.

And there the failures: skull of the ox,    
Where the animal terror trembled on in the hollowed eyes;    
The catastrophic wheel, split, sandbedded;    
And the sad jawbone of a horse. These the denials    
Of the retributive forces, fiercer than pestilence,    
Whose scrupulous realm this was.

Only the burro took no notice: the forefoot    
Placed with the nice particularity of one    
To whom the evil of the day is wholly sufficient.    
Even the jocular ears marked time.    
But they, the man and the anxious woman,    
Who stared pinch-eyed into the settling sun,    
They went forward into its denseness    
All apprehensive, and would many a time have turned    
But for what they carried. That brought them on.    
In the gritty blanket they bore the world's great risk,    
And knew it; and kept it covered, near to the blind heart,    
That hugs in a bad hour its sweetest need,    
Possessed against the drawn night    
That comes now, over the dead arroyos,    
Cold and acrid and black.

This was the first of his goings forth into the wilderness of the world.    
There was much to follow: much of portent, much of dread.    
But what was so meek then and so mere, so slight and strengthless,    
(Too tender, almost, to be touched)—what they nervously guarded    
Guarded them. As we, each day, from the lifted chalice,    
That strengthless Bread the mildest tongue subsumes,    
To be taken out in the blatant kingdom,    
Where Herod sweats, and his deft henchmen    
Riffle the tabloids—that keeps us.

Over the campfire the desert moon    
Slivers the west, too chaste and cleanly    
To mean hard luck. The man rattles the skillet    
To take the raw edge off the silence;    
The woman lifts up her heart; the Infant    
Knuckles the generous breast, and feeds.",u_FiliaSecunda,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FiliaSecunda/comments/ssg6ku/the_flight_in_the_desert_by_brother_antoninus/,,FiliaSecunda,ssg6ku,/r/u_FiliaSecunda/comments/ssg6ku/the_flight_in_the_desert_by_brother_antoninus/,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FiliaSecunda/comments/ssg6ku/the_flight_in_the_desert_by_brother_antoninus/,0,2022-02-14

"""Goa'uld"" =//= ""symbiote""?","(Minor spoilers)

Just another possibly stupid question. In SG we hear the terms ""Goa'uld"" and ""symbiote"" both thrown around a lot, but they don't seem to mean exactly the same thing. I seem to recall Daniel Jackson saying something about a ""symbiote taking a host, and becoming a Goa'uld."" This would seem to imply that the term ""Goa'uld"" is only used for a symbiote which has taken a human host, or possibly any host. We also never hear the snakey bois referred to as ""Goa'uld"" in their solo form, they only call them ""symbiotes"" or ""Goa'uld symbiotes"", as if having a host is a prerequisite for being an actual Goa'uld. So ""Goa'uld"" essentially means host + snakeyboi symbiote.

So, if a symbiote is only a Goa'uld once it's taken a host, then what are symbiotes called when they don't have hosts? They also use the terms ""Goa'uld symbiote"" and ""Tok'ra symbiote"" as if there were a difference, though the two seem to essentially be different political factions within the same species. So, is a Tok'ra a Tok'ra before it takes a host/between hosts? Or is it only a ""Tok'ra symbiote"", until it takes a host?

I'm just wondering if they do actually name the symbiote species at any point. Because ""symbiote"" is not a proper noun, it's more of a descriptor really, so it's definitely not the name of a species. It seems like something so prevalent and important to the canon should have a species name. We know a ton about this species - SG1 visits the planet on which they evolved, and we know that when the symbiotes learned to take hosts, their first hosts were Unas, which then learned to use stargates and did so to conquer and enslave offworld human colonies, which was easy with Unas hosts because Unas will overpower humans every time. We have a fairly clear picture of how the Goa'uld switched over to preferring human hosts (because they're prettier than Unas basically), rose to power, likely under the dominion of Ra during the era of the ancient Egyptians. We also have the complete story of the fall of the Goa'uld as SG canon. And yet as far as I can tell, the symbiote species itself is never named.

Hoping there's an SG fan out there who's maybe read the books or something else that I haven't consumed, who might have the answer for this. I just really want to know the name of the species that the whole show was developed around lol",Stargate,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/ss1pz3/goauld_symbiote/,,AytcheyeQQ,ss1pz3,/r/Stargate/comments/ss1pz3/goauld_symbiote/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/ss1pz3/goauld_symbiote/,22,2022-02-14

The group is currently trying to unravel the mystery behind an unknown faction who are actively kidnapping and infecting prominent members of society with brain slugs.

The Dominion empire has declared war on The Great Iron Fist empire as retaliation for harvesting their sacred living trees during their most important religious ceremony called the Uroboros Festival. The Hyperian Empire to the north have closed their borders after the group publicly unveiled a plot by the league of assassins to infect and control prominent members of society with brain slugs.

[Short] Uq'ud Crusoe - An Alien Lost,"Short  I made as a idea on a comment. No idea if I make a follow-up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

=================================

&amp;#x200B;

This memoir is created from a memory dump from Counselor Uq'ud.

All internal monologs are translated from Dhos'a to Earth Common for your convenience.

This work is gifted to the Smithsonian Museum of Arts as a First Contact gift.

Date 55381.334 - Solar cycle 1

*Beep….Beep….Beep….* 

Slowly my cognitive and motor functions are coming back to me.

*Beep….Beep….Beep…. Reanimation cycle 50% completed.* 

I hear my cryo-pod relay to me in Dhos’a. Such a small feature, but so welcome after visiting four different star-systems. I am so done with Common for a while.

*Beep….Beep….Beep…. Reanimation cycle 75% completed.*

The worst part, as nerve functions are returned, and my body suddenly realizes it was in cryo-stasis. I’m cold. But the infra-red heating, and the cocktail of reanimation fluids is driving that away swiftly.

*Beep….Beep….Beep…. Reanimation cycle 100% done. No abnormalities found.*

Not that I would expect any abnormalities found after cryo-stasis in a Lairqok “Long Distance Cryo And Emergency Pod”TM. They are created with the highest standards, without dropping any of the comfort.

The high-density polymer front shows only a little light from the surrounding chamber to filter in, but the internal lighting is more than enough for me to take a look around. I have to wait a moment until the wake up chamber is pressurized, so I try to shake out the numb feeling in my right hind leg.

It’s always that leg, maybe I should replace it with a synthetic?

*Beep….Beep….THONK*

My head whips up, what in Zut'ul Holy Word was that? 

The information display inside my pod has suddenly turned dark, but the chamber hasn’t unlocked yet. 

I try pushing against it, but to no avail.

Then I can see a shadow move across the front screen. So at least somebody is awake at the other side.

A rapid knock on the front should draw their attention. 

The shadow comes back, and seems to press itself against the screen. 

It’s opaque, you can’t see through it, for security and privacy reasons. Why would they even try?

I knock on the front screen again, and the shadow jumps back. For a moment nothing happens, but then some banging on the side of my pod. My two hearts start beating faster. 

Get a grip on yourself Uq’ud. The maintenance crew is only trying to open the chamber. 

There’s probably a glitch or system failure. Which, on its own, is strange. It’s a Lairqok for all. And yes, *ofcourse*, this should happen to me. But no worries, the Lairqok will reimburse greatly for my discomfort. 

A discharge of air around the seams of the front plate indicates the efforts of the maintenance crew are at least fruitful. Slowly the door opens, and I flatten and rearrange my feathers back into a regal semblance. I’m a Counselor of the Dhos’a.

When the door is opened completely, I step out of the cryo-pod, into the wake up chamber. An eerie silence hangs around me. Something is amiss.

From behind the opened door of my cryo-pod a figure emerges. Instinctively I step back.

It’s smaller than me. The top of it’s head doesn’t even reach my neck.

But also, because it is bald. No feathers, only a patch of fur on the top of its head?

But that is not why I’ve recoiled. I’ve met a lot of alien species, most even uglier than a Threvods. But this specimen is strong, very strong. I can see cables of thigh wired muscle fibers bulging below its skin. It looks almost comical, but my old-mind senses danger, and so I listen.

The creature slowly steps into view completely, while not taking its wrongly set eyes off me. They are in the front of its head, so how could it see behind it, I can only wonder. But that gaze… Like looking into the void itself, and the void stares back.

Slowly one of its arms moves up, and it shows me the palm of its hand. Fingers spread. Then it moves it in a left-to-right motion in front of it. Maybe it’s a form of greeting?

I look down at my three fingered hand, and try to mimic its motion. It’s difficult for me, because my shoulder joint doesn’t move in the same manner. But I try nonetheless.

The creature bares its teeth at me! Quickly I create more distance between us. The creature quickly closes its mouth, and drops its head. Is it sad?

Wait, now I remember. I’ve seen these kinds of creatures before. On the Extranet was a notification of a new species that entered the Dominion. What was the name again… a Hu’mans! That was it. Not much was known. 

But the Extranet shared that they had colonized the only moon around their cradle world, and the next planet in their system, even before they invented a way to reach them in any reasonable timeframe, or having cryo-stasis. Their cradle world is classified as a Deathworld, and the colony planet is even worse. There is not even an atmosphere.

Spacetravel is a nuance, a means to an end, a necessary evil to endure. But these Hu’mans didn’t seem to mind staying awake for more than 16 dozen solar cycles! Absurd.

During my ponder, the Hu’man has moved itself back to the cryo-pod it probably came out of. Opening a small locker at the bottom, used for personal items, but it pulls out pieces of cloth. Ah yes, they are fond of clothing. Another alien aspect. A bland, brown-gray, piece that covers its groin area, and another piece, in the same color that covers its torso. Its arms, and bottom half of its legs are still uncovered. Lastly an item is pulled out, and placed on top of its head.

For a moment I’m staring at the white pins stacked around the head-ornament. My implant is scanning to determine its makeup and uses. *Teeth*. This creature has a row of teeth around its head piece. What kind of barbaric monster have I met? I wonder if those are bounty pieces?

Time to get this nightmare back under control. And I lift myself up to full height. Straining my hind legs a bit. But now I tower above the creature. The top of its head is now only reaching my abdomen. 

The creature only looks at me, it’s head slightly skewed. Like it’s seizing me up. Then it’s shoulders move in an up-and-down movement, and it turns around looking around the walls of the wake up chamber for something.

I deflate. I would have expected at least a sliver of fear, or maybe only recognition? But this Hu’man doesn’t spare me another glance. 

So, I instruct my implant to connect to the Extranet to see what I’ve missed while asleep. But a red indicator at the top-left says there is no connection possible. That is a first. I let it run a diagnostic. All implants report back as healthy. But the micro-wormhole connection implant that is used for Extranet dial-in, reports that it is unable to create a stable wormhole to one of the endpoints.

My hearts have just reached their normal rhythm, before firing up again. No wormhole possible? As far as I know, and I know a lot, that has not happened before.

Slowly I take a look around the wake up chamber. And then it occurs to me, that not only has no other cryo-pod disembarked any of their occupance, the whole room seems off. Like the room is titled, but my feet are on the floor. Of course that is the whole purpose of artificial gravity plates, but I can’t seem to shake the feeling.

All interfaces are dark too, only emergency lights, powered by a chemical reaction are illuminating the room. My only companion is currently pulling at the airlock door. Silly Hu’man, those are built to withstand the differences between the vacuum of space and the atmosphere inside this ship. It stops its endeavors.

I nod my head. Finally. The Hu’man is off to inspect other parts of the wake up chamber, and with nothing else to do, I keep track of it. As it inspects a metal railing, it suddenly grabs it, and pulls it off the wall without any problem. Then it walks back, and jams the metal bar in the side of the door. Wrenching it open.

Before I can stop it, it already pushes the door out of it’s holding, and a hiss of released air whips around me. And then stops. What is this? This room should have decompressed immediately. The Hu’man turns around and looks at me expectantly.

Slowly I come closer and peer out of the gap in the door. Trees and foliage greet me on the other side. We are planetside. 

The Hu’man waves at me again, then holds its hands up, and makes a series of gestures using both hands. A moon, touching its second finger of its left, with the fourth finger of its right, touching the back of its left hand, and touching the fourth fingers of both hands together. 

I have no idea what this means.

The Hu’man shakes its head, points at itself, then outside. Then points to me, and outside. Has it gone mad while in stasis? We can’t go outside on an unknown planet!

But the Hu’man does not even watch if I follow it, and pushes the door open further, and steps outside. I have no reason to follow him, but I also do not want to be left alone here.

Will there be another LEGO Jurassic World video game?,"Just gauging how likely this will be, by getting feedback from fellow fans.

I absolutely loved the 2015 game LEGO Jurassic World, but, of course, it only covers the first four films. Not sure when the IP rights end for Jurassic Park that LEGO has access to, but I'm assuming it will end shortly after the Dominion ad campaign ends.

So, this begs the question, do you think it was a popular enough game to release a sequel?",JurassicPark,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/ss33o8/will_there_be_another_lego_jurassic_world_video/,Toys,Inevitable-Flow-9661,ss33o8,/r/JurassicPark/comments/ss33o8/will_there_be_another_lego_jurassic_world_video/,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/ss33o8/will_there_be_another_lego_jurassic_world_video/,6,2022-02-14
Starcraft Book Club - Spectres,"Now it’s time to look at Starcraft: Ghost: Spectres by Nate Kenyon. This was a weird one and probably far too ambitious.

Spectres was published in 2011, over five years after Starcraft Ghost had been ""indefinitely suspended"" but still about three years before Blizzard officially admitted that the game was cancelled. So the novel was tasked with adapting the general story that had been planned for the game. Not unprecedented; The novel Lord of the Clans had successfully covered the events of the cancelled Warcraft Adventures. But there was a lot more baggage to carry for this book.

The story from Starcraft: Ghost: Nova was continued in three volumes of the Starcraft: Ghost Academy mangas. The story was already pretty inconsistent when TokyoPop stopped publishing books. But although they finished the initial story arcs there were a lot of threads that were left hanging. Spectres picked up sometime after what was planned for the cancelled mangas. The telepathic boy, Colin, was already reunited with his father. The children of the various Old Families had been murdered not long after being rescued. Of Nova and Tosh's former teammates one was still working as a Ghost for the Dominion still not knowing what happened to her father and another had had his consciousness transferred into a computer. All these big event were skipped and covered by some light exposition, with only the aftermaths explored in Spectres. And along with these leftover Ghost Academy characters the wrangler from the Nova novel made his return leading to a very crowded cast of supporting characters.

And then along with covering the plot of a cancelled game and serving as a sequel to a bunch of cancelled mangas, Spectres also had to serve as a prequel to Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty by showing us the early part of Tosh's fight to lead his Specters against Mengsk and the Dominion.

As you can probably guess, the quality of the novel ended up being pretty poor. Tosh's portrayal was very different from the mysterious and intense character from Wings of Liberty or the proud young man from the mangas. Despite having some justifiable motivations he came across as just being sick and delusional. Nova was clearly supposed to be struggling with whether she was doing the right thing carrying out the Dominion's assassination missions and letting her memory be wiped over and over. But she seemed to just shrug off the moral dilemma and it wouldn't be the last time that these questions would be raised but not really confronted. As for the supporting cast, they really didn't carry the emotional weight to make their personal tragedies provoke any emotional response and the Ghost Academy characters didn't have any more depth than they did in the mangas. The same went for the big reveals and betrayals which failed to justify any shock.

After a big jump in quality for the novels that built up to Starcraft II, Spectres was a major disappointment. And the ending just felt uncomfortable in multiple ways with its treatment of Nova and Tosh not giving the reader any motivation to learn more about them. This was the last time the ""Starcraft: Ghost"" label would be used and I don't see any reason why it should be brought back.

Starcraft Ghost: Spectres was published September 27, 2011 and reprinted October 15, 2019 with an audiobook narrated by Nicole Parnell.(A performer who doesn't have any other connection to Starcraft or Blizzard but she later recorded the audiobook for Starcraft Ghost: Nova which never actually got released.)

"20 for 10, my top twenty New Japan matches of the ten years under Bushiroad | #11: Hiromu Takahashi (c) vs. Kushida (IWGP Junior Heavyweight championship • Dominion • June 11, 2017)","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/941gizw90sh81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53da07965f0cfd3d7cbca866312f2db3650f757c

**\[** [**Intro**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdTMOEWWvY) **|** [**Match**](https://njpwworld.com/p/s_series_00442_1_06) **\]**

THE feud blow-off.

Golden Age NJPW puts together four otherworldly arcs, including the sensational story told with the juniors from late 2016 to mid-2017. The best one in years in a division that hasn't reached the same highs since. It’s also the story among the four with a definitive resolution, thus with the most satisfying conclusion. Part of the brilliance lies in the paths followed by the participants.

In the red corner stands Hiromu. Seven months ago, he comes back from excursion on a bang. In his first singles match, he wins the championship decisively at Wrestle Kingdom. He takes the company by storm with his all-out blitz style. He is relentless, reckless, insane... No one has ever seen something like it and no one knows how to deal with it. The Ticking Time Bomb nickname suits him perfectly: his high-impact moveset can end a discussion anytime. While his peers have a more traditional approach with gradual escalation, he throws bombs from the get-go. He benefits from the novelty and is invincible, until he meets an old foe during the Best of the Super Jr. 24: Dragon Lee. He defeats him soundly earlier in the year at The New Beginning in Osaka but the *luchador* knows him better than anyone else and inflicts him his first loss. It cracks Hiromu's armor and the competition notices it. The unstoppable force is human; the unstoppable force can be beat. And he will be again, twice, and miss the final. Come Dominion, his aura and confidence aren't as suffocating. He appears more vulnerable than ever.

In the blue corner stands Kushida. The junior Ace rules the division until the fateful Tokyo Dome encounter. Crushed on the biggest stage, starts for him a downward spiral. At Sakura Genesis, Hiromu buries his soul six feet under when he squashes him in less than two minutes in the semi main of the third or fourth biggest show of the year (first time the juniors reached this spot). On the occasion, Kushida tries his opponent’s method and jumps him before the bell, like Hiromu did at Wrestle Kingdom. A mistake because he is a cerebral guy who needs a plan and it backfires spectacularly. Affected psychologically, it’s also a period where he struggles with concussions, he needs to regroup. Part of the recovery begins in the United States with the ROH Television title. Come the Best of the Super Jr., his groove still isn't back. 0-2, his Hoverboard Lock doesn’t do the job anymore. A trend started in January and in April: when Hiromu reaches for the ropes while about to being locked (Wrestle Kingdom) or locked (Sakura Genesis) in the move, Kushida rolls back towards the middle of the ring but Hiromu uses the momentum to free himself by muscling him up for a Time Bomb attempt. So Kushida invents a new finisher to transition away from the counter, Back to the Future, and gets on the board against Bushi, an old foe too. He rallies and reaches the final where he beats Ospreay, another heated rival, with an assist from an avalanche Back to the Future. Come Dominion, Kushida is a new man as shown by his sparkling, one-off gear. With a lot of momentum, he is once again at the top of his game.

Despite his recent slump, Hiromu remains a constant threat. A wounded animal is the most dangerous. Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion in general and don't ever overlook his lethal arsenal specifically. His explosive, high-octane offense puts perpetual pressure. Unlike Omega whose basic stuff looks too devastating for its own good, it’s by design. He throws bombs left and right, from start to finish. It’s excruciating, painful and fruitful. With the pro-LIJ (but still split on Naito) smarky Osaka crowd, the odds are stacked against Kushida. For him, it’s like being on the road for a game seven or a conference championship, which makes for an even bigger uphill battle.

He is in for a fight and the long run. You can’t fully prepare for what Hiromu brings to the table. You can’t predict the unpredictable. Kushida can only contemplate hypothetic scenarios beforehand and be ready if/when they happen. He knows he must hang in there, as risky as it sounds, for the windows to open because they open inevitably. It’s not pretty, it sure isn’t easy. But hey, it’s the challenge of his life. Make it or break it.

Therefore, he grinds. Every single second. Poised, he deals with every situation that kills him previously more effectively. When the bell rings, his hatred pushes him straight into a strike-fest. His drive quickly takes over and he emulates Dragon Lee’s opening in his Best of the Super Jr. win. He initiates a slap exchange, something Hiromu loves to do from time to time and something that usually shreds his opponent’s chest badly. Not tonight. Kushida doesn’t necessarily win the flurries but doesn’t lose them either. Actually, Hiromu is the one who retreats.

Kushida doesn’t shy away from the bomb trading. He also follows Hiromu’s non-traditional pace where the frantic rhythm to start slows down as the match progresses. Himself thinks outside the box: early dive, dropkick onto the crowd, two punches instead of one at the end. In the preceding months, he tries to extinguish the fire with water and fails so now, he fights fire with fire. A more aggressive, borderline sadistic demeanor is part of the solution to overcome a swarming antagonist finally, and part of the effect this antagonist has had on him since Wrestle Kingdom: he broke him mentally on top of the physical beat-downs. He has a direction and follows it as well as possible. He sticks to the arm because that’s what gave him his name. He is also proactive in a smarter way as he brings the wood but not blindly. He got embarrassed trying to beat Hiromu at his own game while playing Hiromu’s game in the Sumo Hall; here, he matches aggression and boldness with his own rules since he controls his emotions. He sees many tricks coming. Even if he can’t avoid them all, those that score don’t overwhelm him, being more familiar with them.

When Hiromu quickly goes for the Time Bomb, he manages to escape. When Hiromu tries to set up the devastating top rope Cazadora from the Tokyo Dome, the arm work bails Kushida out. He avoids the fatal Sunset Powerbomb and continuing one of the lingering themes, he survives when it connects. When Hiromu becomes the first to clog the Hoverboard-Lock-to-Back-to-the-Future pipeline, he doesn’t crumble and stays committed to the arm, anticipating another opportunity down the line; after all, this opportunity could come, should come, will come. When Hiromu steamrolls him with his finishing sequence and loads him on the top rope for more punishment, he exploits the breach originated from the champion’s pride to hit an oh-so satisfying equalizer: the avalanche Back to the Future. The super move helped him to get back in contention, now it helps him to get back from the dead. Double down, momentum reset, Kushida has Hiromu right where he wants him. He has lived through everything that led to his previous downfalls, has worn Hiromu down in the process and still has some energy left in him. Do or die. Pushed further than ever before by someone he rag-dolled twice, insecurity, panic and specter of defeat cloud Hiromu’s mind, who loses his cool during the ensuing forearm trading. At this moment, Kushida knows he is almost there. He is in full control of his destiny. Backing-up the physical dimension by mental toughness, up to the task at every level, he has won the war of attrition and just needs to convert his efforts into a W.

Before, it's retribution time. Time to settle the score, to make peace with himself, to unleash the anger and the frustration of the last six months, to avenge the humiliations. So he gathers his thoughts and stomps his enemy like a cold-blooded killer. No mercy. The Osaka-Jo Hall is livid. A payback for Sakura Genesis too, where Hiromu hits Time Bomb, the Death Valley Driver into the turnbuckles and a second Time Bomb to add insult to injury. To prove that he is still the man, that it was just a rough stretch and not the signal of the end, he then reverts to the Hoverboard Lock. When Hiromu is about to grab the rope, Kushida transitions to the submission again because he needs to. That’s who he is and what brought him so many successes. He won’t be denied anymore. Back to a past tried-and-true method, updated to the present’s requirements with a disgusting new angle adding pressure on the wrist on top of the elbow, to secure the future. *Coup de grâce*. Hiromu gives up, in the middle of the ring, which means an undisputed and indisputable triumph. There is something so powerful in the concept of top guys who tap out, especially with enormous stakes on the line. The bloody mouth along his elated expression hammers that no matter how hard the road back to the top was, Kushida still reached the Promised Land.

Even if he can never fully make the match his, the small touches here and there progressively weaken the monster. Combined with how he holds his own in Hiromu’s universe and how he is able to take him out of it at crucial points, it’s enough ultimately to regain his title. He partially cracks the code, partly figures out the man who turned his world upside down. When he plays Hiromu’s chaotic game, he does so by keeping enough structure, foundations, organization to breathe new life to his already impressive arsenal, to gain the extra spark to get over the hump. 

No waste of movement, twenty-ish minutes of madness, characterization, progression, selling, moves / actions with consequences (the general gasp when the Sunset Powerbomb to the floor hits!)... A clinic of limb work and psychology thanks to an awesome layout. Also, how refreshing to see a wrestler targeting a body part and succeeding thanks to it? 95 % of the time, it’s just a plot device for the guy being worked on to have something to overcome on his way to the win. This formulaic structure gives away the winner in the early goings and makes the aggressor look dumb due to how useless it always is. Here, it legitimates method, strategy, intellect. One underrated piece of work overshadowed by a famous main event.

What a shame two birds are killed with one stone. It’s basically the culmination of Kushida's career because the management was already moving into a new direction and he was too grounded to fit with the new age. It also signals the end of Hiromu’s best version of himself, his artistic peak, as he will transition from heel to tweener leaning towards face, from instable, dangerous crazy guy to cool, lovable weirdo. In other words, he will lose his edge and border on cartoonish, hysterical. At least, there will always be this extraordinary conclusion to an exceptional storyline, pinnacle of both careers.",njpw,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/njpw/comments/ss7ksn/20_for_10_my_top_twenty_new_japan_matches_of_the/,,Joshi_Fan,ss7ksn,/r/njpw/comments/ss7ksn/20_for_10_my_top_twenty_new_japan_matches_of_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/njpw/comments/ss7ksn/20_for_10_my_top_twenty_new_japan_matches_of_the/,0,2022-02-14

Some critique needer on a new Sisters player's list,"Having returned to the hobby after a 10 year hiatus and picking sisters as my new army I admit my knowledge on what is good vs not has been challenging.

Hoping I can get some critique on my below list to help my out!

Some context, have only played small 500 point games so far (mixed between melee builds of bloody rose vs more shooty AS). List I made mostly on what I own(but can easily pick up other models as my lgs is well stocked on all things sisters)

Plan is hold objective and do actions with the MSU of MM sisters, with the 2x flamer sister groups running up in the rhino for further out objective clearing.

Shaman Stereotypes,"You will usually not find them playing dominion, they are most common in brawls. This is for two reasons. One being that teammates will always interrupt her during her bites, and shaman players are tired of that. Two being the shaman and nobushi/pk combo. In case you're fortunate enough to have never experienced this, allow me to explain. The nobushi/pk of the team will get you bleeding, and the shaman will bite you. This is among one of the most unfun experiences in the game, only below 4 stacks of pirate/raider, and ranked duels. To anybody that does this, and to the people that did this to me two nights ago, I hope nothing but the worst for your lineage. That aside, actual shaman players are scary. When they get you bleeding, tunnel vision will ensue, as being bitten is easily one of the most humiliating things in the whole game. I fear shamans because they are downright mean and super aggressive.",ForHonorRants,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForHonorRants/comments/sskgn1/shaman_stereotypes/,HUMOR,badgerbro117,sskgn1,/r/ForHonorRants/comments/sskgn1/shaman_stereotypes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForHonorRants/comments/sskgn1/shaman_stereotypes/,3,2022-02-14
Fleet Titan/Comet Elite Run Support Nanny Build,"# Fleet Titan Support Debuffer ""Nanny""

A couple of things to get out of the way first. This is just a template to get people started on support builds - I have way more debuff than is usually needed on something like this, so adjust it for the type of run you are doing.

A couple of quick example changes you might want to make:

* Torp run: Remove some debuff consoles for more \[DrainX\]x2 consoles to increase the amount of shield downtime from opening salvo. Never ever call in Photonic Fleet for these runs if you are a sci, or any pet beacons.
* DEW runs: Drop CF3, put in Photonic Shockwave instead for another cooldown proc for your universal consoles and spam the -DR debuffs like crazy. Change weapon type to something that benefits your DEW counterpart - ex. if they are using Disruptor variants, you should use Coalition Disruptors (up to -100 disruptor debuff from those if we're lucky).
* Sci/Exotic (incl. Grav/PEP torp runs): Drop CF3 because you'll have people killing themselves on their own HY's. Bring Tholian Webspinner if they have one too, when their spinner expires, use yours. They will benefit from the 50% bonus damage passive of their own (not this only affects exotic damage, not other damage types. Maybe a bug?).

Whatever you do, DO NOT use improved gravity well. I know it applies another -20 DR to your primary target, but especially with boosted up control skill, it will suck things around the wrong places. We only want our grav wells to last 20 seconds, 40s is too long. Ideally, you and another support build in the same run will split your gravity wells up (in the case of ISE, one person hits the opening and right transformer, the other hits left transformer and gateway) etc. The only time to used Improved GW is if you are on a particularly slow slow run and know that in advance.

Those of you who have the 10th Anniversary Legendary Bundle have access to the Glenn, which is a similar platform. On that ship, you don't have access to AP Beta 3 or Experimental Weapons, but gain temporal abilities. That's also a great support ship but built a little bit differently (ex. AP Beta 2 and GW3 instead).

This build also makes some assumptions about the team makeup. It's expecting only one or two players to run primary DPS roles, and also expects there to be a tank running Cold Hearted, preferably with Ba'ul weaponry. I tried to squeeze Cold Hearted onto this build but dropping aux power (since I don't have Pilot to trigger CH) was a huge problem.

This build should ideally not crack 100k dps in the run, but we do need at least some damage - our secondary job here is to take out any stray probes/spheres, nanite repair towers and so on to make the run go fast and smooth. This build is also viable outside of ISE but that's the main testing ground used for it. I have helped 6 players finally crack the 1 million DPS threshold in ISE with this build and hope to help many more - and I'd love to see a few more builds like this around.

Thanks for reading.

Beasts at the Gate (M4F),"For nearly one hundred years the southern gates have held, the ultimate barrier of stone and magic seperating the Northern Provinces, from the Southern Wastes. The wall and it's defenders have fought back the beastial hordes again and again, the tide of mutant creatures and horrifying nightmares kept at bay... until now.

The Gates have fallen, the defenders devoured or worse. The lands that have not known war in two generations have grown complacent. They are unprepared, unaware, and horribly ripe in the eyes of the beastmen now flooding northward. They have come to claim dominion over those who stand before them, to rule as brutal lords over their northern neighbors... Or at least pillage the countryside and breed their way through every female they come across.

Yes, it's fairly generic, but I'm a fan of the classics. Cliches exist for a reason, and this one is one my favorites. We have a plethora of beastmen to choose from, and any number of unfortunate young women who fall into their clutches. 

Looking for a focus on breeding/impreg, they're beastmen afterall, their number one instinct is to get the next generation going. I'm fairly open on kinks, just the ""normal"" limits most of us have: scat, snuff, futa, (sexual) gore, m/m. The usual.
I'm very open to suggestions, and ideas, and have no problem going short term or long term. Wanna get crazy? Let's get crazy, I'll at least consider most plots or scenarios. On the off chance someone wants to play a monstergirl, I am very much open to that as well.

Hope to hear from some of you soon.

NOPE Horse Ranch parallels,"Thinking the multi-colored string of flags leading to cloud/ufo on the poster/in the trailer and the wacky flailing inflatables leading to the horse ranch are parallels. 

The inflatables lead the way to a horse ranch, while the flags lead the way to a…human ranch!

These ETs are corralling and domesticating beings over which they feel they have dominion, the same way we do to other species without thinking.",FanTheories,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/st2mfw/nope_horse_ranch_parallels/,,snakobus,st2mfw,/r/FanTheories/comments/st2mfw/nope_horse_ranch_parallels/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/st2mfw/nope_horse_ranch_parallels/,3,2022-02-15
Two changes that this game really needs.,"Hello, first of I'll tell you a little about me and this game. I've played FH on and off since open beta, hard Orochi main, been with him in his times of struggle, and I did not even come back to game after his 2nd rework despite the fact how strong he were (and still is).  


Here are the changes. I'll keep it simple.  
1. Proper ranked mode. It DOES need:  
\- duel and dominion queue,  
\- higher rewards per match, and serious seasonal rewards for a rank,  
\- single-pick and single ban in duel,  
\- draft-pick single-pick in dominion with two bans per team, delivered by first two players in each team,  
\- same as ranked duels - ranked dominion should have like one or two maps selected which are most balanced.  


Explanation:  
This game has already enough champions to introduce bans in ranked games. FH have so much similar champions, which is good in this case, because you can always have one or two side picks. For example me, as Orochi main, I'd could easily play kyoshin, tiandi, zhanhu or even nuxia. Warden could play Warmonger, BP. And so on.  
Proper ranked would bring on some competetiveness into this game, which really lacking in that field.  


2. Serious Faction War rework. This idea which I'm about to present is old as hell. It was posted way back in a day on ubi forums. Mods pushed it trought but we never heard about it anymore, and it was a very cool idea with as less coding as you could image. Here it is:  
\- you keep getting war resources (or whatever it is called, I can't recall) as you do, and you keep putting them automatically or by hand as you desire,  
\- every part of the map would have a little metters above of every faction that put resources, and those metters would have a cap of, lets say, 500k,  
\- lets say that vikings filled up a metter on a samurai land. It would trigger something called ""faction battle"" which would be displayed as two swords crossed above that part of the map which is attacked, with signatures of both sides (in this case samurai and viking logo),  
\- faction battle would include 50 total dominion matches, and everyone from two fighting factions could join with some minor restricitons, like minmal 10 total rep,  
\- whoever would win more thatn 50% of those dominion matches would take the land, and war assets would reset,  
\- faction battle dominion games would be locked for players from proper factions, BUT you would be free to choose any champion from any faction on queue screen (so it would be faction locked in terms of paricipation, but not in terms of gameplay),  
\- for part of the map with a building (I'm talking about those castles and farms which gives some bonuses) there could be a breach game instead of domionion one.  


This change would bring a lot of interaction and thought into faction war. Nowadays nobody cares about it, really. How many people keep putting those war assets by hand? You finish a domion match having few k's of war assets, and all you can do is put it somewhere with several millions already, feeling like ant.  
Described change would give some freshness to this game, a content, something to do besides grinding same things for all these years. You would have some control on what's going on, you would clearly see what's going to happen thanks to those metters. Adding even few k's would matter and would be clearly visible that you participated, did something. Then you would be able to fight over it, see the progress after every battle (ofcourse there would be several dominion matches in same time, so you could end up winning a match and see that you already lose 12 to 8, but amount of dominion matches could be stepped up if needed).  
In the end - as I said at start - it does require not so much of codding, mostly changes to interface, adding some metters and triggers, since it would still be dominion matches but with purpose.  


In the end I'd like to add that I'm dedicated player of competetive games and mmos. You may think how does that relate. Both of these genres are genres which last for a long time, and if they last is because good things in those games are preserved, while bad are changed, and new things are added on and on.  
This game lacks in term of content. Ofcourse, you have new emotes, executions, new armors or retextured ones, but right now it's like 1098 emote, 2010 execution and 505 armor with same assets.  
Lastly, UBI keep talking about how hard is it to get animations due to covid. That's right, so what about screw that and do some coding? It can be done in full efect from home.",forhonor,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/st71j7/two_changes_that_this_game_really_needs/,Suggestions,Pirus151,st71j7,/r/forhonor/comments/st71j7/two_changes_that_this_game_really_needs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhonor/comments/st71j7/two_changes_that_this_game_really_needs/,1,2022-02-15

We have 4 players and are looking for 1 more to join the team!! The group is currently level 12 and will be starting the 6th chapter of the yawning portal called (Against The Giants).

**Time:** We play every Saturday 11:00pm-4:00am eastern time. The more flexible your schedule for late night games the better!! We plan on doing every chapter of the yawning portal campaign. The campaign will run for at least a year if not longer. Only players who are able to commit to a long term campaign will be considered.

**Location:** We are playing on roll20. The game includes music, high quality maps, 2500+ custom made tokens etc. We will be talking in discord (a mic is needed).

**Restrictions:** We are looking for players 18+. The game is usually around 50% combat and 50% RP. No Chaotic evil, anti party members or Insane characters. Combat feats are not allowed (Roleplaying feats are encouraged). No flying. No Optional Tashas. Player romances have to be agreed to beforehand by both parties. Intimate scenes fade to black.

**Group Composition:** Life cleric (Healer), Wizard, Monk, Sorceress.

**Game type:** Homebrew. We follow most rules in the book but will be flexible with some in order to create a better experience for the players. Creatures, lore, side quests, main story line is all homebrew and custom made. All character back stories are important and will affect the overall story. Every major decision, success or failure of the players will influence the story. I spend an average of 20-30 hours a week updating and creating the game.

\-Yawning portal campaign with a homebrew main story.

\-Lore heavy world-Fun and Unique fight mechanics (Boss actions, lair mechanics, using the environment) with multiple ways to handle each encounter. Winning or failing missions will impact the overall story! Your choices matter!!!

\-Resource gathering on maps and item crafting (potions, poisons, armor etc).

\-Epic Music for combat, ambiance and perception cues.

\-Your character's background matters and will be a main focus in the game!

\-Game Recaps are written in discord and we do a debrief at the beginning of every game. We also have chapter recaps for new players so you can jump right in and be caught up.

\-Personal character pages on discord for your use.-Special holiday quests (Christmas, Halloween etc). We also do background flashback quests and also Goblin squad quests where players get to goof off as goblins on crazy missions lol.

\-Custom made inspiration deck that can be used at any time. Inspiration cards are given to players who do something cool in game or make people laugh in discord.

\-Combat, status and concentration mods on roll20 to help players play turns faster.-Lots of homebrew riddles, puzzles and intro pages to hint at what's coming next.

\-Dynamic lighting (this means that spells, torches, campfires etc give off light) and you can only see what your character can see.-A DM that never cancels games!

**Setting:** The campaign is 5e and called the Yawning portal campaign. We have weaved every dungeon of the campaign into an overall homebrew story which is heavily impacted by the player's choices and backgrounds.

**Story:** The group is currently trying to unravel the mystery behind the Zentharim who are actively kidnaping and infecting prominent members of society with brain slugs.

The group is currently trying to unravel the mystery behind an unknown faction who are actively kidnapping and infecting prominent members of society with brain slugs.

The Dominion empire has declared war on The Great Iron Fist empire as retaliation for harvesting their sacred living trees during their most important religious ceremony called the Uroboros Festival. The Hyperian Empire to the north have closed their borders after the group publicly unveiled a plot by the league of assassins to infect and control prominent members of society with brain slugs. Meanwhile, a horde of undead is currently growing by the day, pillaging and harvesting bodies throughout it's empire. The Paladins of Tyr are splintered into two factions after the representative of the green cloaks separated from the church after their council member was caught committing heinous war crimes. Orcs have been seen crossing the impassable mountains and scouting the 3 major kingdoms, an imminent invasion is expected. If you have read this far, write the words ""mixman is the best goblin"" in your application message in order to be considered.

Jurassic Token is a dinosaur themed crypto launched this past December. NFT lines have been released that will be in used in a pay to earn game in development. 

With Tiger King Coin reaching 150+M market cap I see this as a strong contender for a 100x or more gain. $JRSC has the added benefit of a worldwide blockbuster movie being released titled Jurassic World Dominion in June. Whereas Tiger King had a much smaller fan base and Netflix did not advertise and season 2 flopped, Jurassic World will have a global advertising budget and be a major Summer blockbuster. ETH fees also hurt TKING and so I think many more people will flow into $JRSC for the low bnb fees to transact",CryptoMoonShots,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/sstl4y/jrsc_jurassic_token_dino_themed_nfts_game_and/,BSC Token,3i1bo3aggins,sstl4y,/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/sstl4y/jrsc_jurassic_token_dino_themed_nfts_game_and/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/sstl4y/jrsc_jurassic_token_dino_themed_nfts_game_and/,24,2022-02-15

Who lives and dies in each movie.,"I've had a thought as I'm re-watching the films, about if you had to save one character in each film and have a different one die which one's would you choose? I had this thought at least in part because of certain characters surviving or not surviving the novels and how that's affected the movies.

For JP I'd pick Wu or Hammond to die and save Muldoon, bringing it closer to the book and even though the movie made Hammond more likeable the sequels don't really do much to justify saving him imo.

For TLW to die it's an easy pick for Nick Van Owen, that character was tailor made to be killed and really doesn't matter much to the overall film. I'd maybe save Ajay just because he's a sort of main character who gets killed off screen which felt kinda crappy.

For JP3 I can honestly say no character deserved to survive but didn't but the obvious one that should have died was Billy, it was utterly pointless to have him survive. I'd also float the idea that Paul dying to save his son could have been done in a way that wasn't terrible but it wasn't that type of movie.

I'm going to lump JW and FK together to keep this more brief, in terms of a character that I wish hadn't died I'd probably pick Masrani they could have done more with his character than they did. Characters that should have died but didn't I'm gonna go for Wu again, they keep saving him and doing nothing with him other than having him show up in a lab coat and be a dick so hopefully his survival into Dominion ends up mattering.",JurassicPark,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/ssy7ro/who_lives_and_dies_in_each_movie/,,CamF90,ssy7ro,/r/JurassicPark/comments/ssy7ro/who_lives_and_dies_in_each_movie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/ssy7ro/who_lives_and_dies_in_each_movie/,49,2022-02-15
Easy good deed of the day (Day 726),"
##726\. That Which Shall Have no Equal on the Day of Resurrection:

Narrated Abu Huraira (Ra) that the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, ”Whoever says **one hundred times in a day**:

**“Laa ilaaha illallaah wahdahuu laa shareekalahu, lahu-l-mulk wa lahu-l-hamd wa huwa ‘alaa kulli shai’in qadeer,”**

(“None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, the Alone Who has no partners, to Him belongs Dominion and to Him belong all the Praises, and He has power over all things (i.e. Omnipotent)”,}

he will get the same reward as given for manumitting ten slaves; and one hundred good deeds will be written in his accounts, and one hundred sins will be deducted from his accounts, and it (his saying) will be a shield for him from Satan on that day till night, and nobody will be able to do a better deed except the one who does more than he.” [Bukhari,Book #75, Hadith #412]

Jurassic World Dominion trailer CGI looks like hot garbage IMO.,"Look, i'm 32 and my 1st grade yearbook has a section for what is your favorite movie, my answer, written in chicken scratch: Jurassic Park. So the bar is high for me when it comes to doing the legacy justice and really captivating an audience like the 1st movie did.

I recently saw the trailer for Jurassic World Dominion and while it was cool to see Dr. Grant and Ellie Sattler make a return (nostalgia overload), I just couldn't get over how poor and fake the CGI looks.  The dinosaurs walking through the snow looked particularly bad. Is my bar too high? The original Jurassic Park had a sense of realism through actual, physical manifestations of the creatures and while at some points they looked a bit ""puppet-y"", they were still ""real"". Don't get me started on Chris Pratt too, what a terrible casting but that's for another thread.

The youtube video has nothing but glowing reviews in the comment section and I feel like I'm losing any bearing on reality here. Is anyone else disappointed in the graphics shown in the trailer? Maybe my bar is actually too high.

Anybody else realize that Jurassic World is the last man standing of the 2015 soft reboot craze?,"Remember how that was supposed to be the best compromise to the never ending ""reboot or sequel?"" question of cinema. Make it just like the original, but with new characters and cameos of the old stuff.

Ghostbusters failed.

Terminator Genesys failed. 

Star Wars lasted two movies (at least as far as critics are concerned) but the third one ended up liked by no one, and they ended up returning Palpatine for some reason.

Jurassic World was alright I guess. Didn't really like Fallen Kingdom, but notice they brought back Goldblum.

Just saw the trailer for Dominion and they are bringing back Alan Grant (don't know the actor's name), so yeah maybe it will be another Star Wars IX.

The Saturn Configuration theory and its connection to Freemasonry,"One of the most well-known set of Freemason symbols is the Tracing Board which is a set of printed illustrations depicting the various symbols of Freemasonry. The Freemason Tracing Board has always been a source of fascination to me and it became clearer to understand when I discovered the work of David Talbott and his book ‘The Saturn Myth’. From a historical perspective, planetary alignments recorded by ancient cultures may provide clues about the symbols on the Tracing Board. In the book ‘The Saturn Myth’, David Talbott refers to some of the symbols on the Tracing board, most notably the two pillars. According to Talbott, based on accounts from ancient cultures around the world, thousands of years ago the planets underwent great upheavel and aligned overhead Earth in an astronomical event, dubbed the “Saturn Polar Configuration” theory. The planets that aligned were Saturn, Venus and Mars. The image below is how this alignment would have looked — with Saturn as an 8-pointed star.

[THE COSMIC MOUNTAIN TO SATURN](https://preview.redd.it/79epvzbmnzh81.png?width=231&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f60a5993c8e4fd717cea770bdae8ac587d2c7002)

Quote from the ‘Saturn Myth’ book:

&gt;❝The hieroglyphic symbol of the Shu-pillar or mountain (the Saturnian Cosmic Mountain) is called the two pillars of heaven❞

The exact same 8-pointed star keyhole symbolism is shown below on a Freemason stained-glass window.

https://preview.redd.it/b7dlhpxqnzh81.png?width=445&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab89448190255e200602f01863967e71d6cf22c4

According to investigative mythologist William Henry: 

https://preview.redd.it/dlfptsjtnzh81.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=683f43b76281f82e8182fb10c9e9b2f858f44283

We are taught that the Blazing Star between the two pillars (Jachin and Boaz) is actually Sirius. So, it’s possible Talbott has misinterpreted the bodies in the celestial alignment (some people such as Michael Ballinger have suggested that Venus could have been Alcyone). However, it’s generally acknowledged that Freemasons deceive people as to the true meaning of their symbols. For example, Albert Pike said in ‘Morals and Dogma’: “Part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them; but it is intended that he shall imagine that he understands them. Their true explication (explanation and understanding) is reserved for the adepts”.

In the ‘The Saturn Myth’, Talbott describes how ancient cultures around the world interpreted the Saturn Polar Configuration symbol as a bridge between Heaven and Earth. This could be what the ultimate goal of Freemasonry actually is; to reconnect Heaven with Earth, possibly overthrowing God. Tracy Twyman posits at the end of her book, Clock Shavings, that secret societies such as the Freemasons, have “long cherished the idea of being able to penetrate the hidden realm, not only to escape the material “prison” that we are in, but to escape the cycle of death that pervades here, and to take for themselves the immortality of the gods”. Gnostics believed the world had been created by a malevolent being called the Demiurge and that our souls have been trapped in a material prison and have descended from above and are capable of reascending through “gnosis”. Carl Michaeler, the author of ‘Treatise on the Phoenician Mysteries’, wrote on the analogy between Gnostisicm and Freemasonry. He adverts to the theory of the Gnostic origin of Freemasonry. Like the Gnostics, it’s possible that Freemasons want to break out of this material prison and ascend into a higher dimension.

According to researcher Robert Palazzo, the aim of Freemasons is to access “a portal to the mysterious”. Freemasons ascending into a higher dimension would make sense in the context of what the Saturn Polar Configuation actually was. It was a gateway or portal. In ‘The Saturn Myth’ it says: “The god “comes out” and “goes in” on the \[Saturnian\] mountaintop through the “gate”, but he accompishes this without moving from his fixed abode”. The Egyptian Ankh was based on the Saturn Polar Configuration, as Talbott explains in ‘The Saturn Myth’, saying: “The Ankh (whose origins experts have long debated) is but a conventionalized image of the \[Saturn\] Polar Configuration”. In the book ‘Secret Societies: Revelations About the Freemasons’ by Philip Gardiner, he explains that the Ankh was seen as a gateway or portal. Quote: “The Ankh is technically known as the Crux Ansata. It is a simple T-cross, surmounted by an oval — called the Ru. The Ru is often seen as a portal or gateway to another dimension, like Heaven. The Ankh therefore becomes the symbol of transition from one place to another. It outlived Egyptian dominion and was widely used by the Christians as the \[Latin\] Cross”.

[NOTICE THE KEYHOLE-SHAPE](https://preview.redd.it/81beqc6xnzh81.png?width=176&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=840fcefcdb7ff2981f2487ca903a5225f2f65e6d)

According to the book ‘Freemasonry In All Ages’, by Michael Fleming Carey, Saturn has been worshipped and venerated all over the world. Quote: “The planet Saturn would seem to be the star most generally worshipped under different names by different nations. By the neighbouring nations to the Jews it went under the name Moloch, and by the Isarelites, themselves, in the wilderness Chium. It is considered to have peculiarly an Egyptian idolatry. Travelers tell us that as Kibroth Hataavah, in the neighbourhood of Sinai, where are found sculptures, at their cemeteries there are numerous representations in hieroglyphics of the star \[Saturn\] with a human body and a dog’s head — the “dog star” (this is interesting because the dog star is usually attributed to Sirius, not Saturn). According to Michael Ballinger: “Much of the symbolism in use today can be traced back to Saturn worship through Freemasonry and astrotheology”. There’s no denying that the Freemason painting shown above is exactly the same as the hypothesized Saturn Polar Configuration, and so Freemasons could have a deeper connection to Saturn than most people think.

The Saturn Polar Configuration can be linked to other Freemason symbols as well. Probably the most recognizable Freemason symbol is the All-Seeing-Eye, which is included in the architecture of the Great Seal of the U.S. Dollar Bill. Fixed within a triangle, the disembodied eye is surrounded by rays of light and rests upon an unfinished pyramid. This All-Seeing-Eye represents an ethereal and amorphous higher power watching over humanity which gives it a sinister feeling. The All-Seeing-Eye finds its roots in ancient Egypt as the Eye of Ra and can be traced back to the Saturn Polar Configuration. During the alignment of Saturn, Venus and Mars, in their different configurations in the sky, they formed an 8-pointed star as well as a triangle. To quote Talbott from ‘The Saturn Myth’: “Saturn wears the band as a golden girdle, collar or crown. He dwells in it as the pupil of the All-Seeing-Eye”. To see this All-Seeing-Eye alignment explained see ‘Discourses on an Alien Sky#19’ on YouTube. This is probably why the U.S. Dollar Bill has an All-Seeing-Eye with a pyramid below (with the pyramid representing the Cosmic Mountain).

[THE U.S. DOLLAR BILL IS LIKELY A REPRESENTATION OF THE POLAR CONFIGURATION](https://preview.redd.it/n1f1irl0ozh81.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=82807b777e0d2dd58ef582da37863a4bf95b0284)

The symbols on the U.S. Dollar Bill were likely created by Freemasons. After all, the All-Seeing-Eye was adopted by Freemasonry in 1797 and only 5 years later was adopted on the reverse-side of The Great Seal. So, what’s the goal of Freemasons? Assuming the All-Seeing-Eye on the U.S. Dollar Bill is a respresentation of the Saturn Polar Configuration, which David Talbott associates with the Tower of Babel, we have a connection between Freemasons and the Tower of Babel. According to Christopher Hodapp, in his book ‘Freemason Symbols’: “The legends of Freemasony claim that the group was descended from the builders of the Old Testament — Noah’s Ark, the Tower of Babel, and King Solomon’s Temple”. According to Jan Snoek, in the book ‘The Adoption Rite’: “As in most other traditions, so here too, Noah’s Ark, the Tower of Babel, and Jacob’s Ladder are depicted on First Degree Tracing Boards”. Tentatively, it would make sense if the goal of Freemasons was to recreate the Tower of Babel and reconnect Heaven with Earth, and in the process, possibly overthrowing God.

The image below is a comparison between the Freemason Square and Compass (on the left), the Stargate logo (in the centre) and the Cosmic Mountain to Saturn and Venus (on the right). The design of the Square and Compass corresponds to the configuration of Saturn, Venus, and the Cosmic Mountain, as seen in ‘Discourses on an Alien Sky’. In this interpretation, the circle at the apex of the Freemasonic Compass represents the ‘Blazing Star’ and the triangular appearance of the Compass itself represents the Cosmic Mountain or pathway.

Below is art-work from the Stargate movie showing an 8-pointed star with a triangle at its base, paralleling the Saturn Polar Configuration.

Do Ya Feel Lucky? (A Brief History of KenPom Luck),"Thanks to Providence and their massive wins/KenPom disparity, the KenPom luck numbers have been a big topic of discussion lately. Essentially, what KenPom calls ""luck"" is the disparity between expected win percentage and actual win percentage - some of this, of course, is actual luck while some can be attributed to other factors. (Bart Torvik has a good piece about his version of the stat: http://adamcwisports.blogspot.com/search/label/FUN).

Again, my sincerest apologies to Columbia, which hasn't had a positive luck rating since 2010-11. It *is* slightly positive this year, but considering that the Lions are 352nd in KenPom this year, that's not much comfort. I've rounded these off to 3 decimal places, but Columbia's average is indeed slightly worse than Vanderbilt's. Providence, BTW, is tied for 67th with North Dakota - pretty good, but not nearly as good as this year's Friars, who currently sit at +0.226. Lastly, the most neutrally lucky team - that is, the team most accurately rated by KenPom since 2011-12 - is Bradley, with an average luck of 0.

(Worth noting here that Dixie State, Tarleton, and Merrimack have a combined 4 seasons of data here - over time, they should become less extreme. High-tempo, 3-point-loving Savannah State is no longer D1, so they'll be staying where they're at in this ranking.)

****

So, what does this all mean? Well, for most teams, not much. 259 teams sit between +0.02 and -0.02 over the past 10 years - unsurprisingly, Pomeroy is pretty good at rating teams. But a small set of teams consistently are over- or under-achieving. Let's bring out the [graph:](https://imgur.com/a/QzhUPz4)

Not counting our D1 newbies, a few teams stand out. Vandy, Columbia, Dartmouth, Florida, and FAU have combined for 4 overachieving luck ratings in 48 total D1 seasons (the two Ivies didn't play last year). On the other end of the spectrum, Norfolk State, Savannah State, Kansas, WKU, and Yale have just 5 negative luck ratings in 47 total seasons. Again, some of these teams probably are mostly benefiting from actual lucky events - with 358 teams out there, you're bound to get some statistical weirdness where the coin comes up heads 10 times straight - but there are probably some things about these teams and their coaching that result in over/underperformance. 

For instance, Columbia is TERRIBLE at getting to the free throw line - in 4 complete seasons under Jim Engles, the Lions haven't cracked the top 300 in FTR. Not great. On the other side of things: anecdotally, KU seems to win a lot of close home games. Those are a lot better for their winning percentage than for their KenPom rating, and thus their luck stat goes up. As for 2022 Providence, having a very experienced lineup and a foul-drawing/FT-shooting **god** in Al Durham goes a long way to explaining their overperformance.

Hope y'all learned something from that, and please hug a Columbia grad today.",CollegeBasketball,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ssy0vd/do_ya_feel_lucky_a_brief_history_of_kenpom_luck/,Analysis / Statistics,BursleyBaits,ssy0vd,/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ssy0vd/do_ya_feel_lucky_a_brief_history_of_kenpom_luck/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/ssy0vd/do_ya_feel_lucky_a_brief_history_of_kenpom_luck/,57,2022-02-15
Deadly strikes Aldmeri dominion,"I tried to traverse the interwebs for a decent guide but didnt find one yet so I am asking here.

Im playing as an Aldmeri dominion character and was wondering how to consistently farm the deadly strikes set as I am in need of the daggers.

I know I can buy the RNG box in bruma but it is in the hands of the ebonheart pact (and far away). Are there any other good ways?

Need ideas for the plot of an Elder Scrolls themed D&amp;D adventure,"As the title says, I'm currently writing the plot for a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign I'll play with some friends of mine in a few months. The adventure takes place in the universe of the Elder Scrolls. We've already played one campaign in the same world that took place in 4E 202 (after the events of TES V) and now I'm trying to think of the main plot and the bad guy for the new campaign, which takes place 20 years after the first one.

Within those 20 years, there have been some events that were caused by the players' decisions throughout the first campaign. The most notable one is that the 2nd Great War between the Empire and the Dominion began and is still active. However, I want the war to be a side plot for the adventure rather than being the main questline.

So, I need to think of a main bad guy or a group of bad guys (maybe a daedra worshipping cult for example) to make the antagonists of this story. I was thinking of making it about daedric lords or something to do with oblivion that also threatens Nirn and the mortals in it (the stakes have to be high enough for the protagonists to care).

Boon of the suffering raven - a divine boon for a follower of both Ilmater and the Raven Queen,"My group has a paladin of Ilmater who took his most recent level as a UA raven queen warlock. He's also about to be due a reward so I've got a boon for him that includes the suffering aspect of Ilmater and the Raven Queen's dominion over life and death.

**Boon of the Suffering Raven**

Prerequisite: *Must be given to a follower of Illmater and the Raven Queen*

Three red cords are wound around your forearm. And three red cords sink into your skin. Now three red lines are visible just below the surface, tied in with the veins and arteries that move your life's blood.

You may tap into your gift to cast the Toll the Dead, Life Transference and Revivify spells without expending any material components to do so. When casting a spell in this way roll 1d20 if casting life transference or 1d8 if casting revivify. If you roll a 4 or lower, one of the red lines emplaced by the boon to turns black and you gain one permanent failed death saving throw.

If the third line becomes black you immediately die and your soul is claimed by the Raven Queen.",UnearthedArcana,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/st7ohj/boon_of_the_suffering_raven_a_divine_boon_for_a/,Feat,funkyb,st7ohj,/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/st7ohj/boon_of_the_suffering_raven_a_divine_boon_for_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/st7ohj/boon_of_the_suffering_raven_a_divine_boon_for_a/,4,2022-02-15
Another one down😈,"I think at this point either consciously or subconsciously I enter relationships w omnis to turn them vegan lol. But anyways the good news I wanted to share with the only vegans I know since I don’t know many irl, is that my boyfriend of 2 months made the decision to go vegan! Only made it through half of Dominion (over the course of a few days) and told me that he is gonna go vegan cold turkey from a mostly meat based diet. I was a little wary of this since I could never have done it overnight, but he seemed really confident about it. Its only day 2 but he’s already been saying everything is better vegan, and I get to teach him new recipes and ways to shop and its really nice.

I just felt like sharing this because I’ve been seeing a lot of posts about how its hard not to lose hope as a vegan, and I totally get that and I feel that way sometimes too. However the only way a vegan world will come to be is with these victories of people like you and me finding out the truth for themselves and making those life changing decisions.

THE culmination of THE journey.

The last unfinished business of peak NJPW, its last transcendental output for a long time given how it’s all downhill afterwards. Because it’s layered, subtle, rich, with nuanced characterization and work, this is a gift that keeps on delivering on rewatch. Both men fight internal struggles. They toy with the concept of alignment based on the section and the narrative within. The execution and more importantly the story carry the deal and add weight to the slightest thing. Not much can compete with an exceptional blow-off match to cap off a [nine+ year journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/njpw/comments/p3eoci/a_detailed_walkthrough_naitos_improbable_journey/?sort=old), the most fascinating and improbable in wrestling history.

Symbolism and fun bits are everywhere. Louder on day two with 10,000 fewer people, the dome cracks two ""NA-I-TO"" chants during the entrance. In 2014, Naito turns his back to Okada while he poses on the ropes. In 2018, he is askew. In 2020, he faces him. The match-up reaches its stylistic peak at Wrestle Kingdom 8 and Invasion Attack 2016. Otherwise, Okada’s questionable fashion taste post-2017 hurts the eyes, whether it’s the awful 2018 trouser or here the diaperish underpants. Naito’s all-white attire matches the Intercontinental belt, with which he made peace. He still doesn’t wear it because he won’t deny his El Ingobernable present. But he carries it with more respect than ever and lays it delicately on the mat instead of tossing it in the air. He enters the Double Gold Dash with nothing and is about to leave with everything. A prop he used to despise has turned into the gateway to his ultimate dream: winning the IWGP Heavyweight championship in the main event of Wrestle Kingdom, to erase multiple years of frustration, shame, setbacks.

Overall, Naito is collected, composed, focused. Like the day prior against Jay White, he is determined and uses his head over his heart. After his first comeback, he doesn’t pose. Inside him: the biggest threat to derail his trajectory. Savvy, experienced, seasoned now, only he can stand in the way of his *destino*, *a la* Wrestle Kingdom 12. He must overcome his inner demons in order to overcome what’s in front of him: the roadblock, the biggest obstacle of his career, the champion. And you should never underestimate the heart of the champion, especially when he leans towards a darker mood because villains always have a little more in them and it always requires a little more to defeat them.

The opening exchange screams ""for old time’s sake"". A greatest hits type of warm-up between two old foes who enjoy going at it again. They drive the point home later, when they smile at each other while trading forearms on their knees. At Wrestle Kingdom 8, Okada capitalizes on two years of teasing a dirty rope break and clocks Naito. Here, he breaks the mold again with an Irish Whip. He works on top, Naito from behind with the mountain to climb. The correct configuration as it plays to the strength of both, on top of being the right call given the story. Naito is wiry at the beginning because he knows it’s now or never. Usually, he doesn’t lock-up to play with his opponent’s mind. Here, you get the feeling that he is not ready yet to commit; maybe some butterflies and he needs extra seconds to shake them off. Could the stage be too big, again? Reluctance synonymous with character progression. Once he gets going, he regains his swagger. He poses, to lean on something common rather than to show off. Athletes are creatures of habits. They rely on them because they are safe, securing, tried-and-true. Fully in the fight, he can implement his strategy. Let the duelling neck work begin.

In control, the first glimpse of old El Ingobernable appears. He smiles more, throws disrespectful kicks to the head, grabs the hair, drags a submission despite the rope break, spits. Could it be a facade to shake up the remaining butterflies? Or is he truly confident? His *tranquilo* attitude kicks in and leaves the door wide open at times for some Okada comebacks, who opposes big guns such as the shotgun and corner dropkicks to light, basic offense. The champion enters the zone where he is deadly set on terminating his opponent. And it’s all Naito’s fault. Was it really a mistake though? Okada starts to make uncharacteristic choices. He shies away from the neck for something else, an echo to Naito’s ill-advised late audible in 2012. To exploit Jay White’s work from the day prior and to exec vengeance, he goes after the knee. As a vicious device rather than a sound strategic orientation. A turning point both in kayfabe and beyond because the match kicks into higher gear. He drives Naito through a table near the belts for an incredible accidental bit of storytelling: only the Intercontinental title falls. A bad omen? Does it foreshadow Naito’s failure? The ensuing mandatory count-out tease, beautifully executed, does wonders.

Proud of himself, Okada wears a large smirk. He turns back the clock for the best personification of his former self from 2012. It’s the most character shown in a very long time and it’s absolutely glorious. Already behind Naito, the crowd is now dying for him to kick Okada’s ass. Cold, poised, the bully methodically picks the good guy apart. He dismantles him piece by piece. Missile dropkick from the top rope, savage German suplex. Hearing the cheers for his victim, he gets even nastier. ""Alright, look at what I do to your boy"". The bombs Naito didn’t have in 2012 allow him to barely stay alive, to survive long enough, to create room to breathe. After Gloria, his nervous smile reads as ""I knew it was gonna be tough"".

The Wrestle Kingdom 8 debacle is partly due to his inability to sell the leg. Here, he puts terrific details behind it. He clutches his knee, stretches it, touches it naturally without it being on the nose after a move where his lower body hits the mat, he puts his leg up during covers, he limps, he slips. Tanahashi’s influence is all over it. The spinning Destino fails when he doesn’t have enough juice to climb over Okada, who reverses the attempt into his own spinning set-up. On the occasion, Naito becomes the first to survive the spinning Tombstone-Rainmaker combo, in a nail-baiting near-fall that deflates the crowd because of the ""Oh no, here we go again"" feeling. Why the kick-out? Since Okada abandoned the neck several minutes ago, the area isn’t softened enough. In another nice accidental bit, he doesn’t spin much for the Tombstone. Shocked, he needs some time to regroup; a precious delay for Naito to recover. Calmed down, Okada remembers the last card up his sleeve. In deep waters, Naito uses tons of energy to escape. At the mercy of the champion who tries to pick him up, he spits as a last resort, not as a defiant action. Already annoyed by the challenger’s resiliency and the crowd support it generates, Okada gets angrier. ""You wanna play this game? OK"". And he destroys the knee even more under a chorus of boos. In a rare sight, he even plays to the crowd. ""You don’t like it? Watch this"". And he slams the knee on the carpet even harder. The predator toys with his prey. Money is in the chase as they say. He grabs the wrist, fires two short-armed lariats but the dissection takes too much time. Naito avoids the third coming in the form of the Rainmaker and follows an almost picture perfect Destino, although without the full wrist-clutch. The landing kills his knee and he can’t cover immediately. Too bad because at Invasion Attack 2016, he wins his first IWGP Heavyweight title, over Okada, with this very move. The hurt leg prevents him from putting all of his weight on the body so Okada kicks out.

However, Naito has him right where he wants to. Just like Kushida against Hiromu, he can gather his thoughts, bask in the moment, realize he is at the finish line and only needs to cross it. Knowing that he inflicted critical damage, at least convinced he did, like Kushida, it’s time to make peace with himself so he goes for the Stardust Press. El Ingobernable tries the Stardust Genius’ finisher for the third time and each bear a special signification. G1 Climax 27 final, he needs every single one of his killer shots to get the upper hand in an insane bomb-fest. Wrestle Kingdom 12, he gets carried away, the instant gets too big. On the verge of fulfilling his destiny, he reverts to the Stardust Genius persona and wants to please the crowd. Wrestle Kingdom 14, here we have the Shuyaku arc encapsulated in one meaningful move. He uses it to exorcise his demons. Finally at peace with both personas and the Intercontinental belt, aware that neither the Stardust Genius nor El Ingobernable can do the job separately, he taps into the best from both. Stubborn in a peacefully way, he also tries to redeem his two misses. Or, it’s the character wanting to put in the rearview the Stardust Genius definitely so he has to make sure the Stardust Press won’t be enough. When the blow doesn’t seal the deal, he keeps his composure. He doesn’t panic. Actually, the kick-out puts his heart at the right place. ""Now I know the answer wasn’t in the past and lies in what I have today. It’s not about what was stolen from me; it’s about what I gained during the ride"". Thing is, it adds substantial damage. Naito had to embrace his former self to be complete so the Stardust Genius, still there inside, can’t get it done but contributes and El Ingobernable will do the rest.

Like every great villain, Okada provides an ultimate scare when he tries to reverse the wrist-clutch set-up into the sit-out Tombstone set-up, recently used to put away Sanada at King of Pro-Wrestling and Ibushi on January 4th. But Naito counters and is the one who hits his new set-up inaugurated the previous day: Valentia-to-Destino, a combo he failed to hit repeatedly against Jay White in 2019 before finally nailing it against him on Saturday. Between both moves enters the fateful hand gesture, the one done with an elated face and signaling that the stage had become too much for him in 2018, that the thread was slipping through his fingers. Here, in control of his emotions, it signals that the journey is about to end even if, symbolically, it’s already over. The ghosts of Wrestle Kingdom’s past are defeated. Naito is on top of the universe. The Tokyo Dome exults.

El Ingobernable needed the Stardust Genius for Naito to fulfill his lifelong dream. In the process, he defeats a generational rival who did a lot of first time ever instead of him, the would-be successor of Tanahashi. On this day, Naito is the one who rewrites the history books: he closes the first two-day Wrestle Kingdom by becoming the first double champion (and really, should have been the only one). To this day, he is still the only one to beat Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight championship twice. How poetic?

Clunky build-up? Absolutely. Naito2~~belts~~yearstoolate? Definitely. The outcome? Fantastic anyway! This match resonates deeply on a personal level. I'm terrified to death by airplanes and didn't take flight for twenty years but still went to Japan to witness the conclusion live. Around March 2019, I decided to go there because I felt, I knew that was it. Even if I will always maintain that the right call was two years before, man did I lost my mind on several occasions, especially when the Tokyo Dome and I shouted the final three-count. I was there live both days and the closing sequence was by far the most deafening. When Naito body-slammed Okada, the place and I went nuts because we knew what was coming. When he climbed the ropes then connected, we lost our mind. Biggest pop of the weekend... for like two seconds. Okada kicks out, I almost collapsed, for a gasp even bigger... for like five seconds. Then followed Destino and the happiest three-count of my life as a wrestling fan; the ""one, two, three"" was unlike anything I've ever been a part of.

Until the end, Okada vs. Naito would have been the barometer of the Golden Age. 2012 (40th Anniversary Show) kick-starts it, 2018 launches the downward spiral, 2020 closes it spiritually and thematically. It all comes full circle, including for Naito’s character who, all the way through the peak and the match, must fight deeply rooted instincts to stop getting in his own way and to overtake his toughest opponents. Nothing comes easy. In a main event fuelled by the past to build the immediate horizon, Okada digs way back. He delivers a sensational performance, tainted with deep nuance to bring to the table what’s best for the proceedings. He displays flaws to be beatable; yet carries himself as a deal big enough, as a champion imposing and dominant enough for Naito’s win to remain the milestone over the final boss. By achieving this difficult balance, he purposely takes a backseat to the overarching story, while dealing with enough material to move his own arc forward. His LIJ salute is genuinely heart-warming. Assuredly one of his finest performances ever. The kind of Ace’s *tour de force* Tanahashi thrived in for years. On a show where the Once in a Century Talent proves for the thousandth time what a miracle worker he is, his heirs make him proud. Eight years later, they finally follow up on the promise of their initial classic and deliver the definitive match they have been chasing since.

To be perfect, the long-awaited and long-overdue coronation needed to happen at the expense of Okada (check), in the main event of Wrestle Kingdom (check, albeit on January 5th...), for the IWGP Heavyweight championship (check, and then some), in a next level match (check, all-timer). Finally, the reign many have been clamouring for is upon us. Finally, a breath of fresh air at the top. Future looks so bright; 2020 will rock! How about closing the Tokyo Dome and celebrating first? Bring on the iconic shot of both belts raised, the confetti, the triumphant walk up the ramp, the proper curtain call for the biggest extravaganza to date, the happy end already. Cherry on the cake, Naito can cut his most anticipated promo and have a legendary roll call. Boy it’s gonna be something else! It could be even louder than the pinfall! He earned it. He deserves it. What a cathartic moment! Everything in the world is and will be OK from now on. ""Los, Ingobernaaaaables

What build are you playing right now? What's your character been up to?,"(Let us know beforehand if you have mods, in case someone else wants to try your build!)

I've been playing on my Switch lately due to a lack of a PC. Portability's nice, but damn, do I wish I could mod it. Currently running with an **argonian mage**, as I rarely use magic-heavy builds, and I'm loving it! I'm using every school except Illusion. Summon an atronach, put on mage armor, and blow shit up. I'm also wearing heavy gauntlets and boots, and eventually a heavy dragon priest mask, partially for looks. I'll grab a few Heavy Armor perks up the left side, but only when I have extra perk points to spend.

RP-wise (for those that care), she's currently working through the ranks of the Companions, having joined them because she felt weak and out of breath often. Turns out, that was just because of this necklace she got off of the Butcher of Windhelm! She's a bit power-hungry, but not outright evil, and beelined for the Gauldur Amulet when she heard of it, so that's now her go-to necklace. Now, she's embraced her werewolf side after tearing through Treva's Watch as one.

She's also a member of the College of Winterhold, and, though she doesn't care for politics, Aldmeri Dominion included, she just hates Ancano because he's an arrogant douche. The Eye has her immensely curious, but she's a bit pissed about the Psijics refusing to tell her anything. She doesn't like their whole mysterious act, even if she does acknowledge they're powerful mystics.

In the future, I plan on her sort of ""joining"" the Companions and College together. Join the Companions if you can fight, regardless of how you do it. But if you're more of a scholarly type, join the College. The Companions aren't a charity, but if someone wants to take up a job that has no pay, that's on you.

What about your characters? Even if you don't roleplay, I'm still interested in hearing other builds ~~even if it's sneak archer for the tenth time~~.",skyrim,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/st4b1z/what_build_are_you_playing_right_now_whats_your/,,pumpkinbot,st4b1z,/r/skyrim/comments/st4b1z/what_build_are_you_playing_right_now_whats_your/,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/st4b1z/what_build_are_you_playing_right_now_whats_your/,16,2022-02-15

I'm gonna say it.,"I really don't want any other movies after Dominion, unless they are prequels or ""in-between"" movies. If Dominion is going to the be the ""epic conclusion of the Jurassic era"" then please let it be that. We have a compelling story developing in Dominion, but I can't see it going anywhere else earnestly after this movie, even without knowing the full plot-details of the movie. I can't recall from which specific sources I've heard there are going to be more movies, but I have heard it floating around. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

# Endurance(stamina/pain tolerance):

&amp;#x200B;

* GZ followed the MUTOS from [Honolulu](https://youtu.be/l_skUvZMBys?t=81) to this [city](https://youtu.be/l_skUvZMBys?t=210) all the way to Los Angeles.
* [Takes](https://youtu.be/l_skUvZMBys?t=83) multiple [beatings](https://youtu.be/l_skUvZMBys?t=222) from the [MUTOS](https://youtu.be/l_skUvZMBys?t=298) on separate occasions and is still able to keep fighting/swimming across the world.
* [Got up from a skyscraper falling on him](https://youtu.be/l_skUvZMBys?t=444), though he was pretty weakened after this(he collapsed from exhaustion at the end after all), his next showings have better feats in this regard. For some reason Godzilla is just weaker in this movie both physically and atomic breath wise, I’m not sure why he’s weaker... but he gets way stronger later on.
* [Multiple](https://youtu.be/YtOhIhCXUMk?t=119) lighting [Strikes](https://youtu.be/YtOhIhCXUMk?t=147) from Ghiadora and was still able to keep fighting
* [Was hit by the oxygen destroyer](https://youtu.be/d_4sZT1Iwh4?t=164) and still managed to swim all the way back to his lair.

* [Had the axe lodged into his leg but it still didn't impact his performance](https://youtu.be/vojCMd5L58s?t=96)(at least that’s how I see it)
* [Took](https://youtu.be/RiV6voYxldQ?t=16) hit [after hit](https://youtu.be/RiV6voYxldQ?t=52), and then [more hits](https://youtu.be/RiV6voYxldQ?t=59) and [then](https://youtu.be/RiV6voYxldQ?t=114) some [more](https://youtu.be/RiV6voYxldQ?t=118) from [MechaGodzilla](https://youtu.be/RiV6voYxldQ?t=129) and was still able to fight/use his atomic breath. Though at some of those points he was pretty stunned, the point stands that he still walked it off.
* [Pincer strikes from Prime, still able to fight](https://imgur.com/a/x4rePkJ)
* [Even after being heavily weakened by prime, he was still able to pick her up and use his nuclear energy to finish her off](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/c90fe23f-3bea-4399-8725-5eb4928c9488/dd7lorv-421385e4-f0c0-4b53-9d27-ed4d3989ff62.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2M5MGZlMjNmLTNiZWEtNDM5OS04NzI1LTVlYjQ5MjhjOTQ4OFwvZGQ3bG9ydi00MjEzODVlNC1mMGMwLTRiNTMtOWQyNy1lZDRkMzk4OWZmNjIuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.QviIB5XGj5jI4OfBXrBKQX9VYFXWgUTkGh0vo2GTqeU).

[REQUEST] Looping Trek GIFs that are good for virtual meeting backgrounds.,"Hey. I was wondering if someone has a good repository of nice looping GIFs that could be nice for a virtual background for things like Zoom meetings.

If not, would someone be interested in making them? (I have no skills)

Some ideas below?

Relaxing ones:

* Janeway or Picard ready room with the warp stars going by
* Voyager warp core
* Borg alcove
* Just some general nice looking space

Action ones:

* Dominion battle?
* Borg battle
* Borg walking through a corridor

Any other idea?",startrekgifs,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekgifs/comments/st7t90/request_looping_trek_gifs_that_are_good_for/,Gif Request,thuja_life,st7t90,/r/startrekgifs/comments/st7t90/request_looping_trek_gifs_that_are_good_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrekgifs/comments/st7t90/request_looping_trek_gifs_that_are_good_for/,32,2022-02-15
About the Spinosaurus......,"Is it possible that there will be a “T.rex vs Spinosaurus” rematch in Camp Cretaceous season 5 ? 

The reasons why I guess there would be a rematch in Camp Cretaceous :

1.The T.rexes are on the same island with Spinosaurus. With the T.rexes being portrayed in a less antagonistic light than the Spino.

2.Camp Cretaceous season 5 is said to be the final season of the animated series. It would be great if they feature an epic “T.rex vs Spinosaurus” rematch in the season finale.

3.As much as I hope they feature Spinosaurus in Jurassic World Dominion. It would be a bit excessive to feature 3 large carnivores in one film.",jurassicworld,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jurassicworld/comments/stlrjd/about_the_spinosaurus/,,AlfalfaPossible,stlrjd,/r/jurassicworld/comments/stlrjd/about_the_spinosaurus/,https://www.reddit.com/r/jurassicworld/comments/stlrjd/about_the_spinosaurus/,0,2022-02-16
"20 for 10, my top twenty New Japan matches of the ten years under Bushiroad | #8: Hiroshi Tanahashi vs. Kota Ibushi (G1 Climax 28 - Final • August 12, 2018)","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s8pam3u286i81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98d0fd55e9ba478c726a6e94e203f1312788c744

THE redemption.

They can do whatever they want with Okada, Tanahashi will always remain my Ace. Okada puts on classics in his prime; Tanahashi does so in the twilight of his career. At 41 years old, a few months after Okada earns his record-breaking V12 to his detriment, he completes one of the most engaging comebacks in maybe his finest babyface performance. That’s saying a lot considering the long list on his resume. There was a time where I cheered against him because ""Tanawinslol"". In 2018, I cheered for him because he reaching the top one last time was so captivating, compelling.

The battle of philosophy settled in the main event of Wrestle Kingdom 13 actually begins here, in stupendous fashion. Before laying hands on the final boss / second half of the Golden Lovers, the hero must go through the under boss / Golden Star, someone who idolizes him as one of his Gods but whom he didn’t emulate.

Tanahashi the character must deal with an athletic specimen, owner of nuclear weaponry. Tanahashi the man and his formula must deal with someone allergic to limb selling. On all fronts, the task in front of him is gigantic. The contrast in mobility, style and approach doesn’t bode well in theory because it should make the slower, soft-hitter, leg-worker Tanahashi look bad / worse. But the Once in a Century Talent doesn’t back down before a challenge, as daunting as it looks. Never has, never will. Odds stacked against him, he confronts adversity and wills this match to all-time greatness through sheer heart, sweat, dedication, determination. There is something incredibly fulfilling about watching a master at his craft figuring out live how to solve an equation. This is such a hill to climb and it becomes higher immediately. Ibushi more than holds his own on the mat, where Tanahashi usually controls anyone not named Zack Sabre Jr. Logically, Ibushi also gets the upper hand when they trade blows. He tried to work around his opponent’s strengths but very early, it becomes clear for Tanahashi that he will have to work through them to stand a chance.

Sympathetic selling and desperation get across how high the mountain is. And he slowly climbs it. Inch by inch. He keeps getting the worse of the exchanges; he keeps getting out-gunned, out-raced, shut down. But he keeps trying. And he keeps paying for it. But he keeps coming back. He hangs in there. He avoids, counters, reverses, blocks. Pretty? Not really. Effective? For sure. Small victory after small victory, piece by piece, he chops down the monster. Epic uphill journey for someone disadvantaged across the board. The quintessential display of fortitude, gut, grit, courage, perseverance.

Ibushi is a world-class hitter who pummels the Ace and who is offended by the frail retaliations. Especially one. When Tanahashi ""muscles"" his way out of a powerbomb attempt entering the last third, Ibushi loses it. The insulting feeble slap invites Dark Kota to the dance. ""Are you kidding me, that’s all you got? Let me show you how to use your hand"". And he unloads a brutal, unsettling barrage of palm strikes making you genuinely fear for his opponent’s health. Can his decaying body absorb such treatment? This sets the stage for something legendary, satisfying to no end. Guys crumble in front of the Berserker mode. Not Tanahashi. He isn’t another guy. Instead, he brings the fight to Ibushi. He knows it’s going to hurt, but he is tough enough to endure it. The one whose solidity was constantly questioned until not so long ago has made a living out of sustaining pain. He is doing it for real judging by how he clutches his legit injured arm sometimes or how he winces after every impact. Just a normal day at the office. So he faces the storm. Full force. Fired the hell up, he asks for more. The sequence during which he moves forward through the slaps is one for the ages. The single greatest display of hulking up ever. It also turns the tide completely as he penetrates Ibushi’s head, not accustomed to such bravery, tenacity. You can see discomfort, fear, doubt in his eyes as well as in his slaps. ""What do I have to do to put him down? And to keep him there?"".

The answers? Discus lariat, Boma Ye to the neck, back-flip double knees, lawn dart, swan dive German suplex, powerbomb... Down the stretch, Ibushi dishes out a murder’s row of devastating moves to seal the deal. Tanahashi goes through a rough patch where, once again, you dread that this dead-eyed psychopath might hurt him or, worse, cripple him. ""What are you doing, you lunatic freak? Leave my Ace alone"", making him all the more endearing. Sure, they go overboard. However, it plays into the story: Ibushi has the firepower, Tanahashi the willpower.

Transcendental talent, the latter is so good that some of his best art succeeds despite the bad tendencies of his opponents. Ibushi won't sell the leg, whether it’s the early try, the second wave in the middle or the late callbacks? The Ace still finds a way to make it count. Basically, he treats his limb-work as inefficient due to his age and the youth of Ibushi allowing him to power through it, but is savvy enough to go back to it occasionally. The light focus puts money in the bank he cashes in from time to time to bail him out or as cut-offs. More importantly, it creates damage that Ibushi doesn’t realize until it's too late; the plague is in the place, Trojan Horse style. Thusly, the no-sell is covered. How brilliant?! An exceptional sign of growth for the performer compared to the stinker put on in the same spot five years ago, when he wouldn’t stop targeting the knee while Naito wouldn’t stop no-selling it. In 2013, the stain on Tanahashi’s all-time great year is enough for me not to have him as my New Japan wrestler of the year. In 2018, he works around Ibushi's similar refusal to produce something still cohesive with what they are aiming at. This incredible *tour de force* is the crown jewel of what may very well be Tanahashi’s definitive year, which not only cements him as my undisputed wrestler of the year, but also as someone on my short list for best ever. The strategic acumen adds a terrific layer in kayfabe and beyond. The wrestler and the man change their plan to work an Ibushi match: less subtle, flashier, with a huge emphasis kept on emotion and story. The leg work still matters because in the end, Ibushi can’t escape the fateful High Fly Flow super combo: to the back, cross-body, regular.

Tanahashi’s leg work gets him there; his iron will gets him through the finish line. Toughness, physical and mental, has always been a staple of his career. Half of his greatest attribute, the physical part, turns into a liability as he grows older and older. However, after Wrestling Dontaku, he finds the Fountain of Youth, a metaphor to express how he manages to tap into the other half of his greatest attribute, the mental part, and old Tanahashi gives way to the Tanahashi of old. As a battle-tested warrior dealing with a long list of debilitating injuries, he turns back the clock to fight time, his body as well as his enemies. And he pulls off the miracle run to win the most grueling tournament in wrestling. Never has the Ace looked so majestic in his victory pose.

The match is spiritually correct in that the proceedings mostly reflect both men’s best traits and asks to care / root for the right person. Because he can’t portray normal human emotions, Ibushi usually underwhelms as the focal point of stories where he is the hero. Here, he is the supporting cast telling someone else’s heroic saga. All he needs to do is do his things: throw vicious strikes, gnarly bombs and wow with aerial prowess. Because he is a historically great face held together by duct tape and spray, Tanahashi carries the emotional burden. Because he is also a historically great storyteller, he cooks a layout hitting as many right notes as possible for all parties involved. The result is arguably the best G1 Climax final ever.

Twice in my life, I cried in front of wrestling. Both times happened courtesy of one man, in the span of three months. After the tears of sadness at Wrestling Dontaku, the tears of joy to conclude the summer of rebirth. The ultimate good guy, no one connects with me on a deeper level through struggles, facials and characterization. Tanahashi’s arc in 2018 is arguably the greatest piece booked by the company. In my opinion, Golden Age NJPW puts together four stellar, otherworldly arcs that are legit masterpieces. Tanahashi’s last hurrah is the final one, it peaks here, and New Japan has never recaptured the magic since.

A few circumstantial elements play into the result as well. Firstly, Tanahashi earns his win because someway he applies his proven game plan. More importantly, for the spectacle, he makes up for the gap in physical condition by absorbing a staggering amount of punishment. In a sense, he pays his due and doesn’t cruise through all of this unscathed. Secondly, in kayfabe, the roll he has been on ever since Wrestling Dontaku helps him to get over the hump. Extra touch of soul, extra spark of spirit are a thing; momentum matters. Thirdly, he is the ""freshest"" competitor. On the one hand, the additional day to rest between his block clincher and the final does wonders. On the other hand, even if the veteran goes the distance against Okada, Ibushi is on a back-to-back after running through a buzz saw the day prior and a gauntlet throughout the B block, which was no cake-walk compared to the A block.

Anyway, around the globe, 2018 has a knack for fading dynasties, seemingly on their last wheel, yet doing the job one more time despite unprecedented roadblocks. That year, the concept behind Tanahashi, as a whole and in the G1 Climax 28 specifically, is akin to the Patriots winning the Super Bowl LIII or the Real Madrid winning the 2017-18 Champion’s League. It took the wrestler two and a half years to get back on the top of the world or near it at this point, with the first six months of 2018 particularly excruciating. He reaches a milestone of his revival, while protecting his vision of the sport against a flag-bearer of a generation about style over substance. As time heals all wounds, Tanahashi’s road to recovery, his longest and hardest ever, even includes making peace with a former heated rival, against whom he also engaged into philosophy warfare in the past to defend what he spent years to (re)build, hence his broken body and in return this thank you run. A rival now in his corner to cheer him like his biggest fan, who parades him around triumphantly in a beautiful, tear-jerking tribute. As soon as Shibata appeared on screen to spread the ropes for him, Tanahashi already had one hand on the trophy.

Ibushi couldn’t knock God out of heaven. Let Love &amp; Energy resonate in the Nippon Budokan! Some will point to Wrestle Kingdom 13 but in my book, this is the greatest feel-good victory of the late 10s, if not the decade. When wrestling is right, it hits differently. Go Ace!

More than just the Egyptian ones!,"Howdy Gamers! 

  I've posted on here about this before but I've been making a Yugioh inspired D&amp;D campaign. I've really been trying to flesh out the world and make it feel like it's more than just what's happening to the party at that moment. Part of this effort was the creation of various gods and pantheons based off of some yugioh cards and archetypes. Lemme know what y'all think!

&amp;#x200B;

 Pantheon of the Monarchs

* Formed when Erebus and Ehther struck a deal with the Sacred Beasts, the Monarchs hold dominion over the world and the forces that shape it. Though they are only God-Kings and not Gods. During the events of the story, they are the main pantheon.
   * Otherworldly Monarchs
      * Erebus, the Underworld Monarch
      * Ehther, the Heavenly Monarch
   * Worldly Monarchs
      * Granmarg, the Earth Monarch
      * Thestalos, the Firestorm Monarch
      * Raiza, the Storm Monarch
      * Mobius, the Frost Monarch
      * Kuraz, the Light Monarch
      * Caius, the Shadow Monarch
      * Angmarl, the Fiendish Monarch
      * Delg, the Darkness Monarch (deceased)

Pantheon of the Dragons Gods

* The four Dragon Gods are worshipped by their respective cults. Each of their followings have lasted centuries, but after the arrival of the Monarchs their followings have diminished. These Gods are not to be trifled with though. They may not be as glorified as they were in their past, they are still a force to be reckoned with.
   * The Dragon of Just Rebellion
      * Its followers seek the destruction of tyranny in all of its forms
      * Roams the world in the form of the Raider's Knight
   * The Dragon with Odd Eyes
      * Its followers take the good with the bad, knowing there is no one true answer to life's many questions. All one can do is swing with the pendulum of life.
   * The Dragon of Clear Wings
      * Its followers believe in having a strict code. By adhering to their code they are seen as they truly are. If they are to break their code, they have killed themselves in the eyes of the cult
   * The Dragon of Endless Hunger
      * Its followers believe in the pursuit of power. They are willing to do anything to get it. Through their strength they feed their lord

Pantheon of the Sacred Beasts

* Ancient and Eldritch fiends who's power dwarfs that of the otherworldly monarchs. They hold dominion over the unseen, their strength influencing the lives all of living things. Yet no one knows their names, except for those who dare to forge a deal with them. They made a bargain with Ehther and Erebus, essentially creating the Monarchs; however, it was through this bargain that they were imprisoned. They are kept asleep by Aangmarl, though if they were to awaken, they would not be pleased with having their gratitude being abused.
   * Uria, Lord of Searing Flames
      * The Primeval Fiend of Desire. Uria once stoked the flames of ambition in the hearts of mortals, causing them to fight, connive, and kill for what they wanted.
   * Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder
      * The Primeval Fiend of Will. Hamon's power used to be the crack of thunder one heard when nearing death. The sudden jolt of strength to persevere. The will to live, or to kill.
   * Raviel, Lord of Phantasms
      * The Primeval Fiend of Fear. The hearts of mortal were once filled with the crippling fear of Raviel. He concocted visions and spectres to torment them, to make them desperate. 

Miscellaneous/Unaffiliated Gods

* Utopia- The God of Heroes
   * Utopia has lived for a great many years and has had many heroic phases throughout them. His heroics are known across the nations and generations which serendipitously raised him to Godhood. However, he is not aware of his godhood.
* Armageddon- King of the D/D Kings
   * The Different Dimension has no one ruler and is instead ruled by warlords known only as the Different Dimension Demons. They are in constant competition with one another, but there is one they all swear fealty to, Doom King Armageddon. Its exact origin is unknown, but it seems to be tied to the Different Dimension in a way none other are. What is undeniable is its incredible power and ability to warp and mold the fabric of the Different Dimension to serve its will.
* The Deposed Gods
   * The two brothers were once the supreme deities of the afterlife. One shepherding the faithful and rewarding them with everlasting paradise, and the other consigning damned souls to their army of the doomed. Though, when the Monarchs rose to power, their following slowly crumbled. Now, almost fully mortal, the brothers wander the world dreaming of the days it was theirs.
      * Adreus- Keeper of Armageddon
      * Tiras- Keeper of Genesis
* The Arrival
   * Not a God in the traditional sense. Born from the minds of those who want to change the world, The Arrival is that change. It holds absolute control of the histories of those who created it. By changing their past, it can fulfill its purpose and change the world.
* The Invincible Atlas
   * No one is really sure whether or not this is a god or not. The Invincible Atlas is a gigantic atlas beetle which on its back carries the city of the Insectoids. The Insectoids worship the Atlas as a living god and as the embodiment of strength. They interpret its actions as divine messages but scholars are uncertain if it truly is divine or if it is just doing what it wants to. Either which way it is incredibly strong and incredibly resilient. So maybe it is a god?",yugioh,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/stq5zi/more_than_just_the_egyptian_ones/,Other,LordWhale15,stq5zi,/r/yugioh/comments/stq5zi/more_than_just_the_egyptian_ones/,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/stq5zi/more_than_just_the_egyptian_ones/,0,2022-02-16

Do the Jurassic World movies ACTUALLY treat the dinosaurs like movie monsters?,"Lots of people have said that the JW films don't treat the dinosaurs like real animals, and instead like ""movie monsters."" And I honestly don't see where they're coming from a lot of the time. Apart from the Indominus Rex and the Indoraptor, which are extremely-modified hybrids specifically meant to be incredibly monstrous and violent, the ""regular"" dinosaurs seem to behave mostly like normal animals to me. Heck, I've seen so many people say that ""they've made the Giga a movie monster for Dominion,"" but where is that even coming from? It behaved pretty much like a natural animal in the prologue, and all we've seen from it so far in the trailer was one tiny clip of it where it just walked out of some trees. What, so walking out of a forest makes it a movie monster?

So I want to hear examples of the normal dinosaurs, ***not the hybrids,*** being ""movie monsters"" in the Jurassic World films, because I really can't think of any for myself. Only example I can think of is maybe the Carnotaurus during the stampede scene in FK and how it randomly stopped running for it's life to hunt, but that's pretty much it, and even then, I'd say that's far from ""movie monster."" The Raptors from JP1 felt more like movie monsters to me than that.",JurassicPark,1,0.99,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/sua1ed/do_the_jurassic_world_movies_actually_treat_the/,Misc,smashboi888,sua1ed,/r/JurassicPark/comments/sua1ed/do_the_jurassic_world_movies_actually_treat_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/JurassicPark/comments/sua1ed/do_the_jurassic_world_movies_actually_treat_the/,135,2022-02-16

"Star Trek of the ""present day"" (Picard era) should come up with a new antagonistic race.","I was thinking about the state of intergalactic affairs in the post-supernova era, and I realized that the Federation has very few political enemies or rivals.

The Klingons have been allies for over a century. 

The Romulan Star Empire dissolved after the supernova and became the Romulan Free State. Not only are they much weaker than before, but also Federation-Romulan relations seem to be trending for the better, with some setback due to the Federation pullout of the relocation.

The Borg were crippled by Janeway destroying their network in the Alpha and Beta Quadrants.

The Cardassians were ravaged by the Dominion, leaving the planet to go through political reform and focus on rebuilding.

The Dominion were defeated, and Odo's presence in the Great Link is likely to lessen the imperialist tendencies of the Founders.

The Ferengi are going through progressive cultural reform under the leadership of Grand Nagus Rom.

The Xindi, by this time, could very well be Federation members.

With all this in mind, I think Star Trek should introduce a new race or political entity to rival the Federation. Or they could expand on older races we rarely see. Some smaller antagonistic forces that are still around include: Gorn, Tholians, Orions, Kzinti, and Breen.

What do you guys think? Should they create a new race and/or expand on an old one?",startrek,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/stizlk/star_trek_of_the_present_day_picard_era_should/,,CaptainWaterpaper,stizlk,/r/startrek/comments/stizlk/star_trek_of_the_present_day_picard_era_should/,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/stizlk/star_trek_of_the_present_day_picard_era_should/,25,2022-02-16

"""The Hundred"" was actually an instinct-driven reproduction endeavour for the Great Link; There may be other Links out there.","Why would they do it? It defies rational explanation why they would expend resources and risk young changeling lives in this way, *unless this is how Great Links reproduce over aeons of time,* and therefore it confers an evolutionary advantage.

It seems likely that reproduction of *individual* changelings is probably just that a healthy Great Link can squish out a new baby drop with no memories. But what about survival strategy for the species overall? That they are all so instinctually driven to join and live together in one clump, is actually a dangerous trait, as it creates a single point of failure for extinction events. As, for example, from orbital bombardment or a communicable disease, both of which we have seen plausibly threaten the Great Link.

""The drop becomes the ocean, the ocean becomes the drop."" But like any life form, they will have an inherent drive to reproduce themselves. And, a need for ensuring continued biodiversity and diversity of opinion. Hence, an incredible instinct to send out innocent babies of your species as widely as you can, even if their overall survivability is bleak. As long as a few (Odo, Lass, etc) survive well enough to eventually grow strong and form a new Link, it's a successful strategy.

We know Changelings exist in myth and lore across the galaxy. This goes back further than the history of the Dominion. Adult Changelings also can natively fly superluminally in space. Therefore their survival strats and instincts will, by necessity, incorporate interstellar factors and concerns.

So perhaps Links send out young members, their ""Hundred,"" every so often as a way of seeding new Links, and have done so for millions of years. One of them, ages ago, was traumatized and abused by solids... Fled, encountered the monkey Vorta, was saved, and subsequently built up the Dominion from scratch. So, instead of saying ""The"" Changelings are the Founders of the Dominion, perhaps it's more accurate to say that ""Some"" Changelings became Founders of the Dominion.

Maybe once we are done exploring the Galaxy, we would find that in addition to the so-called ""Great"" Link in the Gamma Quadrant, there might also be a ""Pretty Good"" Link, and a ""Just Okay"" Link, living elsewhere in the Galaxy.

We just recently saw a new Changeling, hustling a casino on Discovery, with a slightly different shape-changing effect... And there's also Martia, from Undiscovered Country. Perhaps these two Changelings weren't one of the same Hundred as Odo... Maybe instead they are just from a different ""Link.""",DaystromInstitute,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/su8r8r/the_hundred_was_actually_an_instinctdriven/,,OneChrononOfPlancks,su8r8r,/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/su8r8r/the_hundred_was_actually_an_instinctdriven/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaystromInstitute/comments/su8r8r/the_hundred_was_actually_an_instinctdriven/,21,2022-02-16

Bo'okdu'ust adjusted his seat and watched the holotank as his data analysis programs crunched the huge amount of data he'd just received.

He had become used to weird data packets arriving, from strange or unknown origins, many of them feeling, to his instincts, like Confederate Intelligence sources.

His pride insisted it was because he was good at his chosen profession and nothing else.

A part of him knew that with the Great Terran Die-Off, the Confederacy had taken a huge blow to research. Many digital sentiences were gone forever, the biological sentiences (a wide ranging group of heavily altered genetic lines) had lost a massive percentage of their population, the cybernetic worlds had been reported to be full of dead or stasis chassis.

He had been able to deduce exactly when it had happened and how it had happened.

There had been a massive alteration in the Terran Descent Human genome right after the Great Glassing. According to Bo'okdu'ust's analysis, it had to do with the out of control psychic abilities that had been witnessed between the first and second archeoreversion attack.

Bo'okdu'ust had conclusively proven (as well as circumstantial data could prove) that the Terran were heavily psychic even prior to their meeting with the Mantid. If nothing else, their ability to work Substance-W (AKA: Warsteel) pointed at heavy phasic energy capacity.

Of course, the Great Die-Off (Bo'okdu'ust hated that label. It reminded him of the fact that his people labeled everything 'Great'. The Great Herd, the Great Most High, the Great Breakfast Bar. He preferred the more analytical Terran Xenocide Event) had interrupted his research.

Of the original team he had put together, almost everyone had been reassigned, had left voluntarily, or had died.

General Mwrakawk, an intelligent Rigellian female, was still present, although she had left for several months to retrieve her ducks and ducklings. Technical Officer Fifth Grade Dancing Flame 8675309 ""Call me 'Day'"" had survived but had spent a month in mourning after her children that she had hashed with biological lovers and spouses had died.

Bo'okdu'ust understood why she wore black edging on her digital avatar.

The russet mantid *Path to Understanding* was still present, still assisting him with his work. The green mantid Professor 7.4.A, professor of advanced mathematical theory as well as a cutting edge software designer was still there.

Lately, Bo'okdu'ust had noticed that it felt slightly like his project was what he had begun to think of as an 'unboxed black box project' with an undercurrent of pressure to it that he could not put his finger on.

""Have you examined the new data, Doctor?"" General Mwrakawk asked.

Bo'okdu'ust nodded. ""Somewhat. Whoever sent it was *very* careful to comb through it. They were extremely diligent in removing any cultural, social, religious, or ethical references or data in the information.""

*Path* nibbled on the tip of her bladearm. ""I've examined it. While there's medical technology blueprints and data in the datacore, there is nothing that would not be in a normal TDH dataset.""

General Mwrakawk opened her mouth and *Path* held out one bladearm.

""Except, there is a *slight* bit I happened to notice,"" *Path* said. She brought up the data for an implant that could control epilepsy. ""Perfectly normal by all appearances,"" she said. She zoomed in on the molecular chains of the 'wiring' that touched various neurons. ""The reference here is *very* insistent that a certain alloy be used.""

She flipped through the data. ""This alloy right here. A crystalline doped alloy that contains traces of what is called true-silver as well as warsteel.""

Day frowned. ""That's a phasic alloy.""

*Path* nodded. ""Yes. Four times as thick as it would need to be for a standard Terran Descent Human.""

General Mwrakawk straightened up, snapping her fingers. ""They're from before the post-Glassing reconstruction!""

*Path* nodded. ""Yes. It explains their paranoia, their aggression, and their isolationist attitude.""

Bo'okdu'ust shrugged. ""Perhaps. We know little of their history. There may be other cultural and social reasons for those traits, beyond the Terran Descent Humanity genetic wiring making them predisposed to such things.""

Professor Selmina'ak, a Telkan who was working on her doctorate degree under Bo'okdu'ust tilted her head and stared at the holotank. ""Only one stellar system. If the sun has enough light pressure to keep the nebula from disturbing the stellar orbital mechanics, it would have to be a yellow star.""

""The lemurs prefer yellow stars,"" the Treana'ad professor Yert'Lurk said, shuddering.

""We cannot assume they only have one stellar system,"" Bo'okdu'ust warned. ""We also must set aside the idea that they may only be using one planetary body. Terrans have shown the willingness and ability to settle on any solid object large enough for them to stand on one leg upon.""

That got chuckles.

 ""The biggest proof, beyond that, is the fact that I do not believe that they were struck by the archeoreversion attack,"" Bo'okdu'ust said. He paused. ""There is, I believe, and issue.""

That got everyone's attention.

""As we have all discovered since the 'Avenge Me Scream', as I have come to call the data dump by Terran Descent Humanity, Terran Descent Humanity has not always involved all of their allies in the martial disputes,"" Bo'okdu'ust said. ""With that, I did a deep dive into the movement of heavy duty creation engines, specifically rage infused ones from Mars or Mercury.""

He moved over to the holotank and turned it on.

""After the Mar-gite Invasion, I determined that a large amount of ships and war materiel vanished. Additionally, the Terran military, not to be confused with the Confederate military, seemed to funnel a lot of material somewhere unknown,"" he said.

""That data was in the Avenge Me Scream,"" Day said. ""They novasparked and darksang a wide swath of that galactic arm.""

Bo'okdu'ust held up one hand. ""That's what it *says* they did.""

""You disagree, Doctor?"" General Mwrakawk asked.

""I believe that what was written there may be several decades old,"" Bo'okdu'ust said. ""I began examining things out of curiosity after examining the armor technology in the Earthling data.""

Everyone frowned in their own way.

""Mar-gite acidic compounds are able to damage warsteel. On that, I was curious on why the Earthlings would include what is obvious armor metallurgy from several technological generations ago when it would be outdated,"" Bo'okdu'ust said. He moved over to another holotank and turned it on. ""I've done the analysis, including have chemical engineers do real world tests on the armor.""

""And?"" General Mwrakawk asked.

The holotank came on, streaming data, with several windows suspended in the 3D data display showing metal being exposed to liquid.

""Earthling armor, that grey armor, is totally resistant to the molecular acid enzymes of the Mar-gite.""

Bo'okdu'ust felt gratified by the stunned silence as it sunk in.

##Introduction:

The following post will remain open until 23:59 UTC on **Friday, February 18th**. After that, we will move to voting, which will remain open until 23:59 UTC on **Sunday, February 20th**.

To understand the full scope of the UN system, I ***highly*** recommend that you read the UN guide [here](https://reddit.com/r/coldwarpowers/wiki/internationalorgsguide).

___

##General Assembly:

**[1972 Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/srmk8h/un_un_voting_1972/)**

* **A/RES/27/283 (Leopoldo Benites for Secretary-General)** - PASSED (68-0-55-1)

* **A/RES/27/284 (Calling for the Immediate Decolonization of Spanish Colonies in Africa)** - PASSED (17-0-106-1)

* **A/RES/27/285 (Calling for the Creation of a Revised Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty)** - PASSED (56-0-67-1)

* **A/RES/27/286 (Condemning Israel for Not Permitting Free Access to Al-Aqsa and for Judaising the Holy Site Therein)** - PASSED (36-32-55-1)

* **A/RES/27/287 (Call for the Holding of a United Nations Conference on the Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS))** - PASSED (39-0-84-1)

* **A/RES/27/288 (Authorizing UNHCR to Run Refugee Camps in UNDOF Operational Area)** - PASSED (68-0-54-1)

* **[X] A/RES/27/289 (Membership of Federation of Arab Emirates)** - PASSED (52-2-69-1)

* **[X] A/RES/27/290 (Membership of South Sudan)** - PASSED (3-1-119-1)

* **[X] A/RES/27/291 (Membership of Fiji)** - PASSED (70-0-53-1)

✝: Passed the UNGA vote, but not the UNSC vote.

**[X]** indicates a membership vote or an issue that has been deemed an important question under the United Nations Charter. This resolution requires a 2/3rds majority to pass.

**[A]** indicates that the resolution proposes changes to the United Nations Charter. In order for the Charter to be amended, the resolution must pass a 2/3rds vote in the General Assembly and be ratified by the governments of 2/3rds of the United Nations' member states, including the governments of all five Permanent Members of the Security Council.

**General Notes**

In 1965, **Iran’s motion to expand and reform the United Nations Security Council passed the United Nations General Assembly.** However, the necessary amendments to the United Nations Charter cannot be made until all five permanent members of the Security Council (US, UK, USSR, France, P.R. of China) ratify the treaty through their domestic processes. **So far, the US,  the USSR, France, and P.R. of China have ratified the treaty, while the UK has not.**

In 1966, **the United Nations General Assembly suspended the delegation of the Union of South Africa.** Until they are readmitted to this body (by another UNGA resolution), **South Africa may not submit or vote on any resolutions.**

To participate in the UN General Assembly, you **must** first be a member of the UN. Please refer to the UN spreadsheet to see whether you are currently a member. If you are not yet a member, please refer to the bottom of this post to submit a membership application.

Please use the designated comments section to submit motions for the consideration of the General Assembly at the end of the year. Please refer to the UN guide for the powers of the General Assembly.

___

##Security Council (incl. nominations):

**[1972 Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/srmk8h/un_un_voting_1972/)**

* **S/RES/27/135 (Membership of Federation of Arab Emirates)** - PASSED (3-0-3)

* **S/RES/27/136 (Membership of South Sudan)** - PASSED (1-0-5)

* **S/RES/27/137 (Membership of Fiji)** - PASSED (6-0-0)

**General Notes**

To participate in the UN Security Council (UNSC), you must be a Council member. A list of current and prior UNSC members may be found on the UN spreadsheet. Following the elections of 1973, the Federation of Malaya, the Republic of Vietnam, and the Argentine Republic join the following nations on the Security Council: US, USSR, UK, France, China (P.R. of), Chile, Egypt, and Portugal

1973 is the final year of the terms of Chile, Egypt, and Portugal. **Three** Council seats are open in the regional groupings of Western Europe and Africa, Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America. Please refer to the UN spreadsheet to see which regional grouping your country belongs to. It is recommended that you also read the [guide](https://reddit.com/r/coldwarpowers/wiki/internationalorgsguide) to understand the powers of the UNSC. Unfilled seats will be filled by NPCs.

Please use the designated comments section to submit motions for the consideration of the UNSC at the end of the year. Note: Technically speaking, any country may submit a resolution to the UNSC, but a UNSC member must **sponsor** the resolution by commenting ‘Sponsored’ underneath the submission. The motion then becomes the responsibility of the sponsor state. 

___

##Trusteeship Council

The UN Trusteeship Council (UNTC) regulates the UN’s three^1 trust territories. Please read the UN/IO guide for more details.

Only UNTC members may participate in the Council. Non-permanent UNTC members are elected for three-year terms, and unlike the UNSC, may serve consecutive terms. A list of current and prior UNTC members may be found on the UN spreadsheet. Presently, the UNTC consists of the five permanent members of the Security Council (United States, USSR, United Kingdom, France, the Republic of China), states who are currently serving as trustees (Australia, New Zealand, Italy, South Africa), and temporary non-trustee members of the Council (Chile, Togo, Maldives). The number of non-trustee members will always be equal to the number of trustee members. 

If you are a current UNTC member, please use the designated comments section to submit motions for the consideration of the Council at the end of the year.

**Current UN Trusteeship Council Members 1971-1973:** People's Republic of China (P5), USSR (P5), France (P5), United States (P5/Trustee), United Kingdom (P5), Australia (Trustee), Ghana (Non-Trustee), Togo (Non-Trustee) and the Maldives (Non-Trustee).

**Current UN Trust Territories:** Pacific Islands (US), New Guinea (Australia), and Namibia (United Nations)^1.

**Former UN Trust Territories:** French Togoland (1955, Federation of West Africa), French Cameroons (1955, Federation of Equatorial Africa), British Togoland (1955, Dominion of Ghana), Italian Somaliland (1960, Somali Republic), Tanganyika (1962, Republic of Tanganyika), Samoa (Independent State of Western Samoa, 1962), Ruanda-Urundi (Republic of Rwanda and Kingdom of Burundi, 1962), British Cameroons (Federation of Nigeria and Republic of Cameroon, 1964), Nauru (Republic of Nauru, 1966)

1: The mandate for South West Africa was previously held by South Africa, but was revoked by A/RES/23/238 in 1968. In the eyes of the United Nations, South West Africa (now recognized by the United Nations as Namibia) is being illegally occupied by South Africa.

___

##International Court of Justice:

The International Court of Justice is hearing one case in 1973, in which the United Kingdom and the People’s Republic of China are contesting the veto on the membership of the Republic of Pakistan by the French Socialist Union and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The proceedings of this case may be viewed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/rje6i3/un_international_court_of_justice_ussr_french/?).

**Submissions**

Although the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accepts cases at any time of the year, you may also use this post as a submissions docket. Please refer to the UN/IO guide for a better understanding of how the ICJ works in CWP.

___

##International Criminal Court:

The International Criminal Court did not hear any cases in 1972.

**Submissions**

Although the International Criminal Court accepts cases at any time of the year, you may also use this post as a submissions docket. **The ICC in this timeline is very different from the ICC of real life, so please refer to [the UN/IO guide](https://reddit.com/r/coldwarpowers/wiki/internationalorgsguide) for a better understanding of how the ICC works in CWP.**

___

The Religion of Selasia,"In the past, there were different ideas of the gods that look after the Symia. All kinds of beasts of the sky, sea and land have been believed to have offered their blessings to the Shamans and other leaders of the tribes and clans of the past. 

Then, as the age of wars come to an end, the peoples have decided to also mature their civilisation to follow after their neighbours. The leaders have a hard time to reorganise their kingdoms into one, but eventually they succeeded with occasional revolts. One issue with uniting the kingdoms is the unique religions and customs practiced by each, and so a state mandated religion have to be made in order to avoid overt clashes of ideals.

The final result still has some flaws, but eventually 4 Temples have been sanctioned as being part of the modern religious organisation. The 4 gods praised by the Temples are combinations of similar deities that were worshipped in the past. The spiritual leaders have explained that this is due to the fact that the 4 real gods have different aspects that are narrowly viewed by the different clans, and that the new version is the most accurately collected understanding of the Major Spirits.

Abi'Al, the Lord of the Ocean, Father of the Symia. He is a fearsome being known for natural disasters and the monsters that live in his deep dominion. There are various depiction of him, including being a massive fish, gigantic crab, or a gargantuan octopus, and sometimes a combination of it all. He represents the vicious birthright of the Symia, that they are most powerful underwater. He gives his children sanctuary whenever being on dry land have grown too stressful.

E'Sheel, the Maiden of the Forest, Mother of the Symia. She is the one who drove Her children to ascend to great heights. She represents the trees, mountains, flora and fauna of the surface world. She can bring love and care to her children to restore and empower them, but sometimes she can be harsh, for she will despise those who fail to grow fast enough. Her image is sometimes depicted as a  treant or deer.

Zin'Ai, the Lord of Dynamism, the Lady of Wisdom. They are the essence of polarities. They represent intelligence, both of beneficial and malicious natures. They are the trickster god of the pantheon, making the other gods imperfect. Evolution can save the Symia, but it's also a curse. Magic can empower the Symia, but it weakens their nature. Science can advance the Symia, but it can destroy their spirit. Zin'Ai also sometimes likes to have fun by messing with the predictive path of things. It is through Zin'Ai that fate is sometimes not set in stone. They are depicted as theatre masks or a spiral.

O'Liya, the Mistress of the Heavens, the Dancer of the Cosmos. She shares dominion over the weather with Abi'Al. She represents passion, energy, and the forces of magic. She doesn't rest, for she drives the sun to run with the moon, and the chaotic transformation of the clouds, and the slow movement of the stars in the night sky. She is the judgment of lightning, the wrath of fire, and the uncaringness of ice. Those who wish to wield the elements must be brave and strong enough to share Her will.",createthisworld,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/createthisworld/comments/stttgq/the_religion_of_selasia/,[PANTHEON/RELIGION],RoAries,stttgq,/r/createthisworld/comments/stttgq/the_religion_of_selasia/,https://www.reddit.com/r/createthisworld/comments/stttgq/the_religion_of_selasia/,0,2022-02-16
twenty-six when you thought you maybe manage eighteen,"twenty-six years ago

three million babies were born. so many probabilities and statistics. i guess that makes me lucky. \

fourteen years ago

Against the Tide, babies first: sex ed class.

it was a trap, ill conceived by some sick mind. i'm not supposed to know what this is, but i do. yet i didnt know i wasn't supposed to.

furthermore, (no that's not all) if you do have sex before you fall and wedding bells sing, you will spend your eternity in a firey ring.

oh, not moved by fear? why, then this one is for you. shame is the game when the afterlife doesnt do. a cup of water, and one for you, and you. Have some cheetos, too.

Ahh, yes. The day cheetos was ellicit in the death of a twelve year old.

twenty-four cups of water handed out to the class, twelve also handed cheetos instructed to chew, but don't swallow.

'Cheeto kids, spit into your cup. Now find your closest friend with a cup of clear and do it again. If you keep this up, surely you can see. Those with no spit still appear clean. If you wish to stay pious, and pure, and true; well your cup must remain clean, too.'

i looked down at my cup. well, i guess that's me. life was already hard, but suddenly it became quite heavy. the walls seem to be closing in. i might have stood up and left crying.

que the downward spiral of a discarded child.

sex. drugs. violence.\

twelve years ago

once again my life changed, maybe for the better. it wasn't in an instant though. more like a slow progression.

chemicals, bodies, three am drunken cries. none of it satisfied. behavior health rooms and inflicted wounds. none of it proved.

many exit attempts to ponder. was it God or my hesitation? or my need for peaceful passage. time to drop the drugs and think. like, really thi-

wait. im not the only one in pain? im allowed my own opinion over my own dominion? thousands of lives, thousands of theories, the good the bad, human longevity.

maybe im not just another statistic. \

present time

it's here i exist. or at least, i try. ptsd and bipolar wreak my mind. a world of bad habits, memories, and genes litter my life. but one things i've learned over the years is how to put up a fight.

not the easy kind that ends in blood. the kind that test your truth and your personhood. it been twelve years since ive cut my skin. its been 8 since i breathed white powder in.

my aching questions for God still haunt me but the thought of God does not taunt me. to some extent, i will never learn. that is how faith works correct? that our questions cannot be answered. books filled with answers are deemed sus in my opinion.

moderation. thats what ive gathered. moderation is everything. moderation i feel can be synonymous with balance.

see things man-made in our world are supposed to automatically be seen as bad. but we are organic so, wouldn't each product of ours be as well?

the universe is infinite. vision said each choice we make creates an additional universe where you made the opposite choice. or made no choice at all.

and in that our fear of failure is outlined by our fear of demise as we sit and watch the world die. no longer. \",knownothingpoetry,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/knownothingpoetry/comments/sto20t/twentysix_when_you_thought_you_maybe_manage/,,losemehateme,sto20t,/r/knownothingpoetry/comments/sto20t/twentysix_when_you_thought_you_maybe_manage/,https://www.reddit.com/r/knownothingpoetry/comments/sto20t/twentysix_when_you_thought_you_maybe_manage/,0,2022-02-16
"Viking Christian King Knud den Greats letter of 1027 As king of England, Denmark and later also Norway and probably part of Sweden"," **Source introduction:**

As king of England, Denmark and later also Norway and probably part of Sweden, Knud the Great was one of the most powerful rulers in 21st century Europe. In 1027 he traveled to Rome to attend the coronation of the German Emperor Konrad. From here he wrote a letter to his subjects.

This letter is one of the most important sources for Knud the Great's kingdom and sheds light on both his international relations and the situation in his English and Scandinavian kingdoms.

**Dated** 1027 **Origin** Dorothy Whitelock (ed), English historical documents vol. I. c. 500-1042, (London, 1968) 

Cnut, king of all England, and of Denmark, and of the Norwegians, and of part of the Swedes, sends greeting to Æthelnoth the metropolitan, and to Ælfric, archbishop of York, and to all the bishops and leading men, and to the whole race of the English, whether nobles or ceorls.

1. I make known to you that I have recently been to Rome, to pray for the remission of my sins and for the safety of the kingdoms and of the peoples which are subjected to my rule.

2. I had long ago vowed this journey to God, but I was not able to perform it until now because of the affairs of the kingdom and other causes of hindrance.

3. But now I give most humble thanks to my Almighty God, who has granted me in my lifetime to visit his holy Apostles, Peter and Paul, and every sacred place which I could learn of within the city of Rome and outside it, and in person to worship and adore there according to my desire.

4. Especially have I accomplished this because I learned from wise men that the holy Apostle Peter had received from the Lord great power to bind and to loose, and was the keeper of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and I considered it very profitable diligently to seek his special favour before God.

5. Be it known to you, that there was there a great assembly of nobles at the celebration of Easter, with the lord Pope John and the Emperor Conrad, namely all the princes of the nations from Mount Garganus to the sea nearest \[to us\]; and they all both received me with honour and honoured me with precious gifts; and especially was I honoured by the emperor with various gifts and costly presents, with vessels of gold and silver and silk robes and very costly garments.

6. I therefore spoke with the emperor and the lord pope and the princes who were present, concerning the needs of all the peoples of my whole kingdom, whether English or Danes, that they might be granted more equitable law and greater security on their way to Rome, and that they should not be hindered by so many barriers on the way and so oppressed by unjust tolls; and the emperor and King Rodulf, who chiefly had dominion over those barriers, consented to my demands ; and all the princes confirmed by edicts that my men, whether merchants or others travelling for the sake of prayer, should go to and return from Rome in safety with firm peace and just law, free from hindrances by barriers and tolls.

7. Again, I complained before the lord pope and said that it displeased me greatly that my archbishops were so much oppressed by the immensity of the sums of money which were exacted from them when according to custom they came to the apostolic see to receive the pallium. It was decided that this should not be done in future.

8. Indeed, all the things which I demanded for the benefit of my people from the lord pope and from the emperor and from King Rodulf and the other princes through whose lands our way to Rome lies, they most willingly granted, and also confirmed what they had conceded with an oath, with the witness of four archbishops and twenty bishops and an innumerable multitude of dukes and nobles who were present.

9. Therefore l give most hearty thanks to Almighty God, that I have successfully accomplished all that I had desired, just as I had designed, and have carried out my vows to my satisfaction.

10. Now, therefore, be it known to you all, that I have humbly vowed to Almighty God to amend my life from now on in all things, and to rule justly and faithfully the kingdoms and peoples subject to me and to maintain equal justice in all things; and If hitherto anything contrary to what is right has been done through the intemperance of my youth or through negligence, I intend to repair it all henceforth with the help of God.

11. For this reason I implore and command my councillors, to whom I have entrusted the councils of the kingdom, that from now on they shall not in any way, either for fear of me or for the favour of any powerful person, consent to any injustice, or suffer it to flourish in any part of my kingdom.

12. I command also all the sheriffs and reeves over my whole kingdom, as they wish to retain my friendship and their own safety, that they employ no unjust force against any man, neither rich nor poor, but that all men, of noble or humble birth, rich or poor, shall have the right to enjoy just law; from which there is to be no deviation in any way, neither on account of the royal favour nor out of respect for any powerful man, nor in order to amass money for me; for I have no need that money should be amassed for me by unjust exaction.

13. And therefore I wish to make known to you, that, returning by the same way that I went, I am going to Denmark, to conclude with the counsel of all the Danes peace and a firm treaty with those nations and peoples who wished, if it had been possible for them, to deprive us both of kingdom and of life, but could not, since God indeed destroyed their strength. May he in his loving-kindness preserve us in sovereignty and honour, and scatter and bring to nought the power and strength of all our enemies from henceforth.

14. Then, when peace has been concluded with the nations which are round about us, and all our kingdom here in the east has been set in order and pacified, so that we need fear no war or enmity from anyone from any quarter, I intend to come to England as early in the summer as I can get a fleet equipped.

I5. But I send ahead this letter, in order that all the people of my kingdom may be gladdened at my success, because, as you yourselves know, I have never spared – nor will I spare in the future – to devote myself and my toil for the need and benefit of all my people.

16. Now, therefore, I command and implore all my bishops and reeves of the kingdom, by the faith which you owe to God and to me, that you bring it about before I come to England that all the dues, which according to ancient law we owe to God, shall be paid in full, namely plough-alms and tithe of livestock born that same year, and the pence which we owe to St. Peter at Rome, whether from the towns or the villages, and in the middle of August tithe of the fruits of the earth, and at the feast of St. Martin the first-fruits of the grain (which are called ‘church-scot’ in English) to the church of the parish where each man resides.

17. If these dues, and others like them, are not paid in full when I come, the royal collectors are to obtain them according to the laws, sternly and without re mission, from him who is in fault

More than just the Egyptian ones,"Howdy Gamers!  
  I've made a couple posts here before about the Yugioh inspired D&amp;D campaign I've been drumming up. The main thing that I've been trying to do is flesh out the world so that it doesn't feel like nothing is happening outside of the party. Part of this effort was to make some gods! I've been keeping a list of all the gods and pantheons I've made and I figured I should show y'all to get some feedback!

&amp;#x200B;

 Pantheon of the Monarchs

* Formed when Erebus and Ehther struck a deal with the Sacred Beasts, the Monarchs hold dominion over the world and the forces that shape it. Though they are only God-Kings and not Gods. During the events of the story, they are the main pantheon.
   * Otherworldly Monarchs
      * Erebus, the Underworld Monarch
      * Ehther, the Heavenly Monarch
   * Worldly Monarchs
      * Granmarg, the Earth Monarch
      * Thestalos, the Firestorm Monarch
      * Raiza, the Storm Monarch
      * Mobius, the Frost Monarch
      * Kuraz, the Light Monarch
      * Caius, the Shadow Monarch
      * Angmarl, the Fiendish Monarch
      * Delg, the Darkness Monarch (deceased)

Pantheon of the Dragons Gods

* The four Dragon Gods are worshipped by their respective cults. Each of their followings have lasted centuries, but after the arrival of the Monarchs their followings have diminished. These Gods are not to be trifled with though. They may not be as glorified as they were in their past, they are still a force to be reckoned with.
   * The Dragon of Just Rebellion
      * Its followers seek the destruction of tyranny in all of its forms
      * Roams the world in the form of the Raider's Knight
   * The Dragon with Odd Eyes
      * Its followers take the good with the bad, knowing there is no one true answer to life's many questions. All one can do is swing with the pendulum of life.
   * The Dragon of Clear Wings
      * Its followers believe in having a strict code. By adhering to their code they are seen as they truly are. If they are to break their code, they have killed themselves in the eyes of the cult
   * The Dragon of Endless Hunger
      * Its followers believe in the pursuit of power. They are willing to do anything to get it. Through their strength they feed their lord

Pantheon of the Sacred Beasts

* Ancient and Eldritch fiends who's power dwarfs that of the otherworldly monarchs. They hold dominion over the unseen, their strength influencing the lives all of living things. Yet no one knows their names, except for those who dare to forge a deal with them. They made a bargain with Ehther and Erebus, essentially creating the Monarchs; however, it was through this bargain that they were imprisoned. They are kept asleep by Aangmarl, though if they were to awaken, they would not be pleased with having their gratitude being abused.
   * Uria, Lord of Searing Flames
      * The Primeval Fiend of Desire. Uria once stoked the flames of ambition in the hearts of mortals, causing them to fight, connive, and kill for what they wanted.
   * Hamon, Lord of Striking Thunder
      * The Primeval Fiend of Will. Hamon's power used to be the crack of thunder one heard when nearing death. The sudden jolt of strength to persevere. The will to live, or to kill.
   * Raviel, Lord of Phantasms
      * The Primeval Fiend of Fear. The hearts of mortal were once filled with the crippling fear of Raviel. He concocted visions and spectres to torment them, to make them desperate. 

Miscellaneous/Unaffiliated Gods

* Utopia- The God of Heroes
   * Utopia has lived for a great many years and has had many heroic phases throughout them. His heroics are known across the nations and generations which serendipitously raised him to Godhood. However, he is not aware of his godhood.
* Armageddon- King of the D/D Kings
   * The Different Dimension has no one ruler and is instead ruled by warlords known only as the Different Dimension Demons. They are in constant competition with one another, but there is one they all swear fealty to, Doom King Armageddon. Its exact origin is unknown, but it seems to be tied to the Different Dimension in a way none other are. What is undeniable is its incredible power and ability to warp and mold the fabric of the Different Dimension to serve its will.
* The Deposed Gods
   * The two brothers were once the supreme deities of the afterlife. One shepherding the faithful and rewarding them with everlasting paradise, and the other consigning damned souls to their army of the doomed. Though, when the Monarchs rose to power, their following slowly crumbled. Now, almost fully mortal, the brothers wander the world dreaming of the days it was theirs.
      * Adreus- Keeper of Armageddon
      * Tiras- Keeper of Genesis
* The Arrival
   * Not a God in the traditional sense. Born from the minds of those who want to change the world, The Arrival is that change. It holds absolute control of the histories of those who created it. By changing their past, it can fulfill its purpose and change the world.
* The Invincible Atlas
   * No one is really sure whether or not this is a god or not. The Invincible Atlas is a gigantic atlas beetle which on its back carries the city of the Insectoids. The Insectoids worship the Atlas as a living god and as the embodiment of strength. They interpret its actions as divine messages but scholars are uncertain if it truly is divine or if it is just doing what it wants to. Either which way it is incredibly strong and incredibly resilient. So maybe it is a god?",yugioh,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/stq3vo/more_than_just_the_egyptian_ones/,Other,LordWhale15,stq3vo,/r/yugioh/comments/stq3vo/more_than_just_the_egyptian_ones/,https://www.reddit.com/r/yugioh/comments/stq3vo/more_than_just_the_egyptian_ones/,0,2022-02-16

"""RIP AND TEAR UNTIL ITS ISEKAI""","Miquel was the weakest human ever to exist in the Agulko kingdom.

he was mocked by his fellow nobles for being the only one who was born without a particular skill he could level up with, heck even his max level was level 1, meaning that he was genetically such a disaster he could not physically even win against a 10-year-old, let alone win a normal fight.

he didn't know why but he always felt that there was a reason behind it,  but never really gave it much thought, he only knew he hated the demons that frequently tried to invade the kingdom,if the best mages in existence weren't fighting alongside magically enhanced bodies of heroes, we would all bite the dust by now, he didn't know why but he seriously despised demons, oddly enough he didn't feel that reason for it was at all the fact they're attacking the kingdom of his birth, he felt like it was oddly something much more darker and sinister that led towards it, but he didn't know even where to begin to figure out where was that anger coming from.

he enrolled in a prestigious school of Rafegen and started his studying after classes when an elf named ""Drekaer"" walked in and along with 3 of his royal guards they dragged Miquel behind the school and had beaten him to a pulp ""pitiful humans, they're far below us in both physical strength and magic, you should be grateful that our mages are in charge of protecting your country, but you are even weaker than any human I ever saw, so pitiful that I couldn't help but laugh a little hahaha""

Miquel felt an odd hatred towards this elf, odd because for some reason he didn't hate this bullying, but in fact, he hated something unnerving he felt about Drekaer,not only him but a few humans as well, anyway at the day of his graduation years later when he turned 15 and officially became an adult, he was supposed to attend the ceremony of possible past life memory and strength acquiring, students were supposed to put their hands on a crystal ball in the middle of the large hall,as members of all races sat in a large stadium like arrangement, it was supposed to announce great heroes and shame those who are weak, the ball had the voice of lost spirits announce someone's past to them giving them back their old memories and powers, usually the more powerful someone is born physically or magically, the more powerful their past lives could've been, the weaker someone is, the weaker their power.

spirit voice: ""your strength was unmatched, your bow of the sun brought peace to the country of Ufgrah of the world you use to live in before Reincarnating here, back then you were known as 'Teodred the annihilator'

everyone started clapping and cheering as Drekaer Finished his selection on the ceremony, Miquel wads left for last to be a mockery, they were the lowest noble rank the one that came from peasants being loyal to the crown so much that eventually they got recognized as lower nobles, usually on events like these higher nobles like to make a mockery of them when possible,in truth the ability to touch the great orb of wisdom to get memories from ones past life is an extremely expensive thing to do, so if he was anywhere near normal strength he wouldn't have been able to do it, but because he's so weak other nobles allow it as its a great entertainment to mock someone of such low and pitiful status, especially one so weak that they're barely able to walk.

One of the Magicians enhanced their voice to have a much higher volume using magic to mock Miquel on his turn to see his past life memories

""here we have the 'peasantborn' what was he in his past life I wonder a baker, a beggar or a thief lets find out ladies and gentlemen""

at that remark, everyone began to laugh as one of the Guards on the ceremony kicked Miquel in the giant hall with the stand with a crystal ball on top of it.

but before Miquel could even go anywhere near it one of the Higher nobles took an egg and threw it to Miquel's face calling him ""peasant trash"".

the world was so cruel to the nobles that came from peasants that it was decided by the law that if somehow they get a good combat trait in one of these graduation ceremonies they are to be immediately enslaved by a higher ranking noble and be ordered to fight with them however they please.

Miquel placed a hand on the crystal ball of wisdom and the sky turned green, the sun turned black as a much deeper voice than nobles ever heard be spoken from a spirit before started speaking

""REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE SLAYER, YOU FREED YOUR WORLD OF DEMONS,MASSACRED EVERY ONE OF THEM, THEN YOU DECIDED ITS TIME TO MOVE TO OTHER REALMS, BUT THIS REALM HAS WEAK TIME AND SPACE ROAD, SO YOU HAD TO WEAKEN YOUR SOUL TO REINCARNATE, ITS TIME TO RID THIS WORLD OF DEMONS ASWELL, ALL IN HERE SHALL HEAR THE TESTAMENT OF THE SLAYER.

IN THE FIRST AGE, IN THE FIRST BATTLE, WHEN THE SHADOWS FIRST LENGTHENED, ONE STOOD. BURNED BY THE EMBERS OF ARMAGEDDON, HIS SOUL BLISTERED BY THE FIRES OF HELL AND TAINTED BEYOND ASCENSION, HE CHOSE THE PATH OF PERPETUAL  TORMENT. IN HIS RAVENOUS HATRED HE FOUND NO PEASE,AND WITH BOILING BLOOD HE SCOURED THE UMBRAL PLAINS SEEKING VENGEANCE AGAINST THE DARK LORDS WHO HAD WRONGED HIM.

HE WORE THE CROWN OF THE NIGHT SENTINELS, AND THOSE THAT TASTED THE BITE OF HIS SWORD NAMED HIM...THE DOOM SLAYER.

TEMPERED BY THE FIRES OF HELL, HIS IRON WILL REMAINED STEADFAST THROUGH THE PASSAGE THAT PREYS UPON THE WEAK.

FOR HE ALONE WAS THE HELL WALKER THE UNCHAINED PREDATOR, WHO SOUGHT RETRIBUTION IN ALL QUARTERS,  DARK AND LIGHT,FIRE AND ICE, IN THE BEGINNING, AND THE END, AND HE HUNTED THE SLAVES OF DOOM WITH BARBAROUS CRUELTY, FOR HE PASSED THROUGH THE DIVIDE AS NONE BUT DEMON HAD BEFORE.

AND IN HIS CONQUEST AGAINST THE BLACKENED SOULS OF THE DOOMED, HIS PROWESS WAS SHOWN.

IN HIS CRUSADE THE SERAPHIM BESTOWED UPON HIM TERRIBLE POWER AND SPEED, AND WITH HIS MIGHT HE CRUSHED THE OBSIDIAN PILLARS OF THE BLOOD TEMPLES.

HE SET FORTH WITHOUT PITY UPON THE BEASTS OF THE NINE CIRCLES. UNBREAKABLE, INCORRUPTIBLE, UNYIELDING, THE DOOM SLAYER SOUGHT TO END THE DOMINION OF THE DARK REALM.

THE AGE OF HIS RECKONING WAS UNCOUNTED. THE SCRIBES CARVED HIS NAME DEEP IN THE TABLETS OF HELL ACROSS EONS, AND EACH BATTLE ETCHED TERROR IN THE HEARTS OF THE DEMONS.

THEY KNEW HE WOULD COME AS HE ALWAYS HAD, AS HE ALWAYS WILL, TO FEAST ON THE BLOOD OF THE WICKED. FOR HE ALONE COULD DRAW STRENGTH FROM HIS FALLEN FOES, AND EVER HIS POWER GREW, SWIFT AND UNRELENTING.

NONE COULD STAND BEFORE THE HORDE BUT THE DOOM SLAYER. DESPAIR SPREAD BEFORE HIM LIKE A PLAGUE,STRIKING FEAR INTO THE SHADOW DWELLERS,  DRIVING THEM TO DEEPER  AND DARKER PITS. BUT FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE ABYSS ROSE THE GREAT ONE, A CHAMPION MIGHTIER THAN ALL WHO HAD COME BEFORE. THE TITAN OF IMMEASURABLE POWER AND FEROCITY.

HE STRODE UPON THE PLAIN AND FACED THE DOOM SLAYER, AND A MIGHTY BATTLE WAS FOUGHT ON THE DESOLATE PLAINS.

THE TITAN FOUGHT WITH THE FURY OF THE COUNTLESS THAT HAD FALLEN AT THE DOOM SLAYER'S HAND, BUT THERE FELL THE TITAN, AND IN HIS DEFEAT THE SHADOW HORDE WERE ROUTED.

AND IN HIS TERRIBLE RANCOR BETWEEN WORLDS AND THROUGH TIME, THE HELL WALKER FOUND THE WRETCH WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED, BUT IN HIS HERESY WAS LOYAL TO HIS EVIL CAUSE. THE WRETCH ADORNED THE DOOM SLAYER IN A MIGHTY ARMOR, WROUGHT IN THE FORGES OF HELL,  IMPENETRABLE AND UNYIELDING.

WITH SWORD AND SHIELD OF ADAMANTINE STRENGTH,THE DOOM SLAYER SET TO BANISHING ALL THAT WERE LEFT UNBROKEN BY HIS  SAVAGERY TO THE VOID.

YET AS THE MIGHTY TITAN FELL AND THE DREAD ENGULFED THE ARMIES OF THE DOOMED,THE DEMON PRIESTS OF BLOOD TEMPLES LAID A TRAP TO CAPTURE THIS SCOURGE OF HELL.

INSATIABLE EVEN BY THE VANQUISHING OF THE GREAT ONE, THE HELL WALKER SOUGHT PREY IN THE TOMBS OF THE BLOOD KEEP AND BLINDED BY HIS FERVOR, THE LURE DREW HIM IN.

THE PRIESTS BROUGHT DOWN THE TEMPLE UPON THE DOOM SLAYER, AND IN HIS DEFEAT ENTOMBED IN THE CURSED SARCOPHAGUS.

THE MARK OF THE DOOM SLAYER WAS BURNED UPON HIS CRYPT, A WARNING TO ALL HELL THAT THE TERROR WITHIN MUST NEVER BE FREED, THERE HE LIED STILL, AND EVERMORE, IN SILENT SUFFERING BEFORE BEING FOUND ONCE AGAIN, WITH HIS NEWLY FOUND FREEDOM HE BURNED HIS OWN WORLD TO ASH TO ELIMINATE ALL THE DEMONS, THEN REMEMBERING THAT HELL WAS JUST ONE REALM THAT SPREAD ACROSS SO MANY MORE THEY ARE UNCOUNTED, HE DECIDED HE WILL GO THERE BY ANY MEANS ARGENT ENERGY PORTALS OR REINCARNATIONS, ONLY ONE THOUGHT LIES AHEAD, AND THAT IS EXTERMINATION OF ALL DEMONS ACROSS ALL REALMS.

DOOM SLAYER, WITH YOUR OLD STRENGTH, REGAINED NOW WALK ETERNALLY THROUGH THE REALMS OF HOPE AND DESPAIR STANDING AGAINST EVIL WHERE ALL OTHERS FALTER. MAY YOUR THIRST FOR RETRIBUTION NEVER QUENCH, MAY THE BLOOD ON YOUR SWORD NEVER DRY, AND MAY WE NEVER NEED YOU AGAIN, THEY ARE RAGING, BRUTAL, WITHOUT MERCY. BUT YOU, YOU WILL BE WORSE,GO NOW SLAYER, RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE.""

something interfered with him regaining his former self, it appears a separate universe intervened, the universe of doom games, altho slayer never heard mick Gordon songs before as the soul originates from the universe of real slayer and not the game slayer, the music needed a place to exist, thus a forever dark space/time almost black hole like orb floated 2 meters above doom slayers head and seemed to follow his movements while starting to play one by one mick Gordon songs starting with ""BFG division"", Doom Slayer shouted just before the music started to play ""demons are hiding in here taking false human, elf and beastmen forms, I must kill them, KILL THEM ALL!""

after that shout a shockwave bursed revealing all the demons real forms, Drekaer was lucky, if he wasn't the son of the demon lord himself, he would have been revealed already,infact shockwave is stil affecting him its only a matter of minutes before its revealed who he realy is, but before fleeing and soiling himself he first heard sounds that can only be described as most brutal war melody he ever heard, then he saw Miquel jump on top of giant High ranking demon whose real form got revealed right after the shouting shockwave, hold one of high ranking demons hands and break his fingers one by one before tearing entire arm and seemingly enjoy the demons cries of pain, after tearing the arm off he suffocated the demon by putting the newly torn limb in his throat, he tore his other limb and jumped on to another high ranking demon and knocked his head off his shoulders with the newly torn limb, after Dreraker fleed using magic teleportation circle, The Slayer jumped over the city walls once he was done massacring all the demons and scaring the shit out of everyone who attended the graduation ceremony,then he started tearing down the demon lord's army,the was was over in 2 days,the demon lord started groweling before the kind,begging them to stop the slayer,but the king said he wasn't in control over Miquel at all and wasgiving him no orders. many demons would grovel before the slayer begging for mercy but he would just murder them in cold blood and move on set on exterminating them from this realm before he moves on to the next.",HFY,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/stui7f/rip_and_tear_until_its_isekai/,OC,theicyphoenix12,stui7f,/r/HFY/comments/stui7f/rip_and_tear_until_its_isekai/,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/stui7f/rip_and_tear_until_its_isekai/,14,2022-02-16
The Bright Side of NFTs," A Non-fungible token is a non-replaceable digital code, that is all there is to it. Or is there?

Every NFT is unique and based on a particular blockchain. Each blockchain can implement its version of NFT. Its association with the blockchain makes it secure and non interchangeable or divided with another.

The amount of energy used to create these NFTs is the same as that used to make cryptocurrencies. This means they end up using a lot of electricity.

Currently, the [NFT technology](https://medium.com/streamcoin/understanding-non-fungible-tokens-how-the-industry-grew-over-the-years-25c250ffbd9a) is being used to revolutionize and[ evolve fine art](https://www.adweek.com/media/nfts-guide-nonfungible-tokens-cryptomedia-trend-ownership-internet/) (music, graphics, drawings, and whatnot.)

We have seen clipart, fart art, fan art, and whatnot (not to mention [pet rocks](https://etherrock.com/); plain, simple, rocks). Though the absurdity might baffle those with a conventional aesthetic sense, there is a lot for those who like to keep their art collectibles classy!

To purchase or store an NFT, one needs to have a [crypto wallet](https://medium.com/streamcoin/crypto-wallets-for-stream-strm-all-you-need-to-know-dccbcb8e09ab).

# The Revolutionary Characteristic of NFTs

For someone not well versed with technological advancements, NFTs sound like contemporary graphics which might not be aesthetically pleasing. However, that is just the tip of the iceberg.

NFTs have a large array of functions. These graphic JPGs provide owners with exclusivity, (other than bragging rights). For instance, Mona Lanas, by young artist Lana Denina, provides access to many of her exquisite art shows, exclusive art shows!

Artists are currently creating fine art and musical productions on NFTs as well. Primarily, NFTs solve the copyright issues and help artists earn a better share for what they have solely created. However, the possibilities with NFTs are limitless. Mortals have hardly tapped the surface of this non-perishable technology.

Many artists are using NFTs to generate start-up funds from decentralized fan funding platforms. Some are using them to eliminate the middleman. Artists are shedding off record labels to opt for NFT, this not only provides them with a better share for their creations but also gives them creative freedom to produce whatever they want.

NFTs provide artists with the option of earning royalties (a percentage), every time the NFT changes ownership or is sold. Moreover, they can maintain creator rights forever, regardless of who owns it. .

# NFT Artists

Upcoming artists are taking over this new market and gaining not only fame but status too.

1. DJ and music producer Blau (aka 3LAU) made music history when he NFT- ed his new album, earning $11.6 million in a day!
2. Lana Denina, a 24-year-old artist has managed to make $300,000, selling her unique NFT collection called The Mona Lana.
3. Michael Joseph Winkelmann, professionally known as Beeple, sold the most expensive digital artwork, to date, for a whopping $69.3 million.
4. It’s not possible to write about NFTs and not mention the Cryptokitties, Bored Ape Yatch Club, and crypto punks.
5. In March 2021 it was estimated that more than 509,000 NFT artworks were sold, valuing up to a total of $85 million in sales.

# Mainstream Artists and NFTs

Everyone is trying to capitalize on the new trend. Mainstream artists are also participating in the race.

1. Kings of Leon, a music band, is the first band to release its music album in the form of NFTs.
2. Paris Hilton auctioned Ethereum-based hand-drawn artwork to fund three charities. Munchkins (Pari’s cat) portrait sold for $17,000.
3. [The founder of Twitter sold one ](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables)the first tweet [for just under $3 million](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables) inspired by a blog article.
4. Steve Aoki &amp; Stoopid Buddy Stoodios, are launching an episodic series, “Dominion X”.
5. There’s also a show called Stoner Cats starring Jane Fonda and Mila Kunis. The only way to get access to the show; NFT.

Realizing the potential of NFTs, mainstream pop artists Katie Perry is investing in a blockchain video-delivery network. The popular song writer, also, decided to launch non-fungible tokens for her fans commemorating Perry’s events. The artists took to Twitter, saying,

&gt;*“Excited &amp; curious to be launching my FIRST ever NFTs later this year w/Theta Network. Look out for memorable &amp; creative moments from my residency that’s both a digital collectible AND an IRL experience tangible.”*

# Popular NFT Use Cases

The creator economy has embraced the NFT trend quicker than you can say “Blockchain!”

The method of securing digital provenance has been adopted at a full tilt. Popular examples of the different arenas NFTs have joined include,

**1. Digital Art**

NFT digital art has sold like hotcakes with prices ranging from a couple of thousands to millions! The digital art category is the first category to appear in the NFT market, with Kevin McCoy’s “Quantum” being the oldest NFT art minted in 2014. Currently, there are many platforms that artists and creators can utilize to mint their artwork. However, not one platform provides minting for NFT videos. Initially considered impossible, Stream R&amp;D is working effortlessly to introduce the facility of minting video Streams.

**2. Collectibles**

NFT sports collectibles are NFT based sports memorabilia. This genre has led to a new generation of enthusiasts.

**3. Gaming Assets**

This genre took off with Cryptokitties. Now, a variety of games provide NFT gaming assets, it could be a weapon and armor, the options are limitless. Digital gaming assets have gained the highest sales in the NFT genre.

**4. Music**

Music artists are shifting to the NFT marketplace for more than one reason.

**5. Memes**

The NFT meme market is taking off like Apollo 13. Even old memes have been NFT-ed for profit. (Disaster Girl, Nylon Cat, and Overly Attached Girlfriend).

The best thing about NFT is that when artists produce, the entire revenue goes to the creator, without a third party ripping them, for commissions. And every time an NFT is sold the artist gets a percentage or “Royalty” if you may say so.

Purchasing NFTs does not only provide its owners with ownership, fan loyalty, and the rights to brag, but it also comes with exclusivity perks. NFTs ensure security. Since NFTs cannot be duplicated, it makes both the creator and the collector a part of something unique. Holding onto NFTs has also seen to increase their value, since it is a unique token. It is for their resale value that many hold on to them as assets or investments.

# Exploring the Possibilities

Blockchain technology revolutionized the tech industry. It has helped create transparency and security in databases, like never before. This makes possibilities endless. One might just be able to download one’s brain and archive it forever. One might convert it into an AI. Imagine if this was possible when people like Van Gogh and Chopin existed.

One can already see the initial effects of NFTs joining the metaverse.

Stream provides its users with a chance to get in on the act! People can NFT their live streams. Imagine the possibilities.

Stream is going to provide access to exclusive deals to those you purchase from its marketplace.

Stream NFT service will help create endless possibilities for users of the platform, financial prospects of which have been discussed above in great length.

Event Lore: Pirates of the Aurora," 

Pirates of the Aurora, hm…

I’ve got the orders this time, but I will have to give all credit to tk\_hann, and WumpaKing if they also worked on this, as I was not able to collect and add onto orders because I was sick for most of the event. 

One last thank you to ConnorMacLeod for providing me with this article, [https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4eLs6MHUgrBRXnlPJK868k/for-honors-newest-hero-brings-piracy-to-heathmoor](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4eLs6MHUgrBRXnlPJK868k/for-honors-newest-hero-brings-piracy-to-heathmoor), it is an interview by Brittany Spurlin with Elise Trinh and Ian Cardona, going over the process for the pirates and Bou Yin’s backstory, as well as revealing some hidden lore bits about Bou Yin’s story before arriving to Heathmoor.

# Description

The Outlanders have arrived on the shores of Heathmoor. Will you join them as a Pirate and have your enemies walk the plank using your cutlass and pistol

# Event Orders

* Covenants

**A Test of Strength:** *While Astrea and Gryphon both see the Pirates as potential allies, the Factions remain uncertain about Heathmoor’s new visitors. For them, there is no trust to be found here - - only a test of strength.*

Capture 5 zones / Complete 2 matches

**Sea Wolves:** *Years ago, Astrea briefly crossed paths with Bou Yin and her crew. The Warmonger saw the pirates for what they really were - - Sea Wolves - - and she is now determined to see her old ally join the Order of Horkos.*

Perform 10 takedowns / Complete 2 matches

&amp;#x200B;

* What are the Pirates?

**Ancient Treasures:** *While the Pirates have no desire to invade Heathmoor, they are interested in unearthing ancient treasures, forgotten by time. Many have heard them talk of some sort of reliquary, and the riches it may contain.*

Complete 2 matches / Perform 3 executions

&gt;Ancient treasures have been brought up only once before, outside of this season, where a treasure hunter found scrolls and grimoires about Draconite that were possibly from before the Cataclysm. With that said, these treasures could provide a Faction or Covenant with a considerable advantage. 

**No Rules:** *The Pirates don’t come from one specific place. Territorial origins don’t mean anything to them. They are free souls whose only home is the open sea. They don’t follow any rules - - save for their own.*

*Complete 2 matches / Perform 10 takedowns / Perform 3 executions*

&amp;#x200B;

* Pirate Adventures

**Port Xiwang’s Saviors:** *The Pirates earned a reputation as dangerous marauders out on the seas. But every now and then, they would also accept payment in exchange for protection. This is how they became known as the Saviors of Port Xiwang.*

Complete 2 matches / Capture 5 zones / Perform 3 executions

**The Battle of Kilauea:** *The Pirates once took part in a legendary on the volcanic island of Kilauea. Surrounded by a raging storm and scorching magma, the Pirates proved their superiority by securing the island and claiming it for themselves.*

Complete 2 matches / Complete 2 matches with 2 different heroes

&gt;Kilauea is a place in our world, an island of Hawaii, somewhere around 2000 miles from California of the United State’s mainland. Makes me wonder just how the lands of the New World were affected by the Cataclysm to make Bou Yin’s journey to the island possible with her also having had many other adventures.. 

**A Disgraced Emperor:** *Bou Yin came across disgraced Wu Lin Emperor Gao Lei who attempted to hire the Pirates in a bid to regain power. She refused, and defeated him in combat. Only she spared his life, so his shame would persist.*

Perform 3 executions / Complete 2 matches

&gt;Gao Lei just cannot catch a break. Besides that, with him officially not in power, I wonder who is sitting on the throne of the Wu Lin Emperor while Horkos is controlling it and Astrea is still busy with Heathmoor and the arrival of Bou Yin.

**A Devout Follower:** *The Pirate Queen’s lieutenant is known only as the Prisoner. Not much is known about them, but it’s said they spent most of their lives locked up in a prison-village in the middle of the ocean until Bou Yin set them free.*

Perform 10 takedowns / Complete 2 matches

&gt;If I recall correctly, I heard that the Prisoner is an armor set of the Pirate, but I cannot confirm as I have not had the time to level up Pirate. 

&amp;#x200B;

* The Pirate Queen

**A Mother to All:** *After vowing to give shelter to lost souls like her, Bou Yin took in all those looking for a place to belong as part of her crew. For that reason, she is an anchor to her fellow pirates, someone they can always count.*

Complete 2 matches / Complete 2 matches with 2 different Heroes

&gt;It’s canon ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

**Bou Yin’s Origin:** *Bou Yin was just a small girl when the Wu Lin civil war tore apart her village. Her parents and sisters were killed, but not before Bou Yin’s mother sent her youngest daughter to safety aboard a small ship.*

Perform 10 takedowns / Perform 3 executions. / Complete 2 matches

&gt;So Lin Yao’s backstory sets the Wu Lin civil war to have been happening sometime before she arrived at Heathmoor. If we were to set to the season before Marching Fire, considering that in Yao’s backstory describes her working with a governor looking for help, I assume it takes place early on in the civil war, that makes it around a 25 year difference from then to the end Mayhem as I have it in the last timeline, give or take 10 years for the new one coming soon. With that info, I estimate that Bou Yin is roughly in her mid forties as of this season, which is typical for most characters in the game.

**Self-Made Pirate:** *From a young age, Bou Yin proved to be a natural at thieving and fighting. The orphan hopped from ship to ship, from harbor to harbor, learning to fend for herself in a harsh and demanding world.*

Complete 2 matches / Perform 3 executions / Capture 5 zones

**The Queen Arrives:** *Bou Yin, sometimes referred to as the Pirate Queen, has finally disembarked her ship to visit Heathmoor. It’s believed she was taken prisoner by several faction leaders upon her arrival, but rumor is she escaped with ease.*

Complete 2 matches

# A Scribe’s Journal

**A Scribe’s Journal (1):** *“While many fear the wrath of Bou Yin, I for one saw another side of the Pirate Queen. One misty afternoon, I saw her approach a young homeless girl. Sje gave her food and a sword, and she even taught her how to fight.”*

Capture 5 zones / Complete 2 matches

**A Scribe’s Journal (2):** *“One villager stole from the Pirate Queen. It didn’t take long for her to catch him. Everyone saw her push him down the plank of her ship, into the freezing water. He never made it out of the ice. It was a chilling scene.”*

Complete 2 matches / Complete 2 matches with 2 different heroes / Capture 5 zones

&gt;Is that a pun?

**A Scribe’s Journal (3):** *“The Pirates have gone through all corners of Heathmoor in search for their coveted reliquary. But some say their search has finally come to an end. Rumor is, they finally found what they were looking for.”*

Capture 5 zones / Complete 2 matches

A Brief History of the Ayleid Dating System,"The reckoning of years within the Ayleid civilization was chaotic in their early years. The Aldmeri calendar had not yet been formalized, years being numbered by the reigns of petty kings, and the seasons marked by the equinox. As the heartland colonies spread, a twelve month calendar was adapted from the indigenous bird folk. This mysterious civilization based the passing of the months by star signs, most of which we still ascribe significance to today. 

A formal calendar was instituted in what we estimate to be the twelfth century of the Merethic Era, with the completion of the Temple of the Ancestors, what we today call the White Gold Tower. From then on, the city states were informally united by a single religious authority, the Priest-King of this central city-state, who served as a non-denominational broker between the varying faiths. 

The years were counted in groups of nine. The Chim El Adabal, which would become the Amulet of Kings, was entrusted to an ancestral deacon, who carried the amulet on a staff, and would be a guest of the petty kings. The Red Diamond would accept the souls of their sacrificed slaves, growing more powerful with each decade. In return, its power would be lent to the city, magically fortifying their walls against invasion from both this plane, and others. 

For the first time in history, there was a united calendar in Tamriel. Across the Ayleid civilization, it was agreed that it was the Third Year of Fanacas. The Ancestral Priest would remain in the city for eight years, and then return to the Temple for one. These between years were referred to as The Year of the Ancestor, where debts would be forgiven, and wars would be suspended as their fallen brethren transitioned to the ranks of the honored ancestors. City-states would implement their census in this time as well.

Of course, this period of peace was a farce. The only enforcement of this ceremonial goodwill was the communal protection of the red diamond, which the petty kings often refused to give up. Wars were fought over custody of the diamond. Corruption in the temple ran rampant, allowing the most powerful city-states to hold the diamond for decades consecutively, before decadence and infighting led to collapse, and the Temple would reclaim its prize. After three hundred years, the practice was discontinued, the Chim El Adabal was kept safe in the hands of the Priest-King, and the naming of years became nothing more than a ceremonial honor that served to stimulate trade, and little else. 

This system ended with the Narfinsel Schism, a bloody, centuries-long conflict which splintered the Ayleid civilization which began in the last years of the Merethic Era. At the heart of this conflict, the Temple had itself split along theological lines. While no accounts survive, an event ominously referred to as the ""Burning Night"" is alluded to in several Barsaebic writings and one Wild Elf folk song. Whatever the details, it is known that the Chim El Adabal disappeared from record until the time of Alessia. 

Around the same time, the future province of Valenwood was united under the singular rule of the Camoran Dynasty. King Eplear Camoran's conquests had been a subject of anxiety across Tamriel. His first major reform was to adopt the Aldmeri calendar, which formalized a 12 month calendar based on the Ayleid system some three hundred years prior. Over time, the year King Eplear declared Year 0 of his divine rule would become the foundation of what we now call the First Era. This is due mainly to a preemptive treaty signed by several kings of Summerset, three of the Chimeri Great Houses, and the Arch-Curate of the hidden Temple of Auri-El, which held religious authority over the city-states of the Snow Elves. This treaty essentially halted the expansion of Valenwood, in exchange for adopting the Camoran Calendar system, as well as a number of trade concessions. This ancient alliance would later be referenced as a foundation of the first Aldmeri Dominion. 

Over time, the forceful hand of convenience, facilitated by commerce, would lead to the adoption of this calendar by nearly all legitimate governments of Tamriel, including both Ayleid factions. The rest, as they say, is history.

The Pantheon of Selasia.,"In the past, there were different ideas of the gods that look after the Symia. All kinds of beasts of the sky, sea and land have been believed to have offered their blessings to the Shamans and other leaders of the tribes and clans of the past.

Then, as the age of wars come to an end, the peoples have decided to also mature their civilisation to follow after their neighbours. The leaders have a hard time to reorganise their kingdoms into one, but eventually they succeeded with occasional revolts. One issue with uniting the kingdoms is the unique religions and customs practiced by each, and so a state-mandated religion have to be made in order to avoid overt clashes of ideals.

The final result still has some flaws, but eventually 4 Temples have been sanctioned as being part of the modern religious organisation. The 4 gods praised by the Temples are combinations of similar deities that were worshipped in the past. The spiritual leaders have explained that this is due to the fact that the 4 real gods have different aspects that are narrowly viewed by the different clans, and that the new version is the most accurately collected understanding of the Major Spirits.

Abi'Al, the Lord of the Ocean, Father of the Symia. He is a fearsome being known for natural disasters and the monsters that live in his deep dominion. There are various depiction of him, including being a massive fish, gigantic crab, or a gargantuan octopus, and sometimes a combination of it all. He represents the vicious birthright of the Symia, that they are most powerful underwater. He gives his children sanctuary whenever being on dry land have grown too stressful.

E'Sheel, the Maiden of the Forest, Mother of the Symia. She is the one who drove Her children to ascend to great heights. She represents the trees, mountains, flora and fauna of the surface world. She can bring love and care to her children to restore and empower them, but sometimes she can be harsh, for she will despise those who fail to grow fast enough. Her image is sometimes depicted as a  treant or deer.

Zin'Ai, the Lord of Dynamism, the Lady of Wisdom. They are the essence of polarities. They represent intelligence, both of beneficial and malicious natures. They are the trickster god of the pantheon, making the other gods imperfect. Evolution can save the Symia, but it's also a curse. Magic can empower the Symia, but it weakens their nature. Science can advance the Symia, but it can destroy their spirit. Zin'Ai also sometimes likes to have fun by messing with the predictive path of things. It is through Zin'Ai that fate is sometimes not set in stone. They are depicted as theatre masks or a spiral.

O'Liya, the Mistress of the Heavens, the Dancer of the Cosmos. She shares dominion over the weather with Abi'Al. She represents passion, energy, and the forces of magic. She doesn't rest, for she drives the sun to run with the moon, and the chaotic transformation of the clouds, and the slow movement of the stars in the night sky. She is the judgment of lightning, the wrath of fire, and the uncaringness of ice. Those who wish to wield the elements must be brave and strong enough to share Her will.",createthisworld,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/createthisworld/comments/sttvzf/the_pantheon_of_selasia/,[PANTHEON/RELIGION],RoAries,sttvzf,/r/createthisworld/comments/sttvzf/the_pantheon_of_selasia/,https://www.reddit.com/r/createthisworld/comments/sttvzf/the_pantheon_of_selasia/,2,2022-02-16
22 [M4A] The Mummy's Curse!,"The last 5,000 years being spent in a sarcophagus really put a crick in my neck. Especially having to spend the better end of that awake, regaining the power to unseal my tomb. The ancient seal had been broken, releasing me from my burial to walk the world once again, and claim the world as my dominion once more. But first: I gotta get my dick sucked.

Hey! For this rp I'm looking to play a mummy that's been released from his tomb after some pesky archeologist had placed the curse on the world by poking around where she shouldn't. This could also be a defeated heroine rp as well if you want to go yoe to toe with a mummy themed supervillain. Either way; this mummy isn't some old decrepit ghoul wrapped in bandages. He's tall, toned, and incredibly fit for being locked away for years. He's dressed in expensive jewelry but otherwise covered in bandages. He can control these bandages like another limb, allowing him to completely encase and mummify any cute prey that he happens to set his eyes on.

My hopes for the plot of the presumed “Redfall”,"I really hope that based on the game being called Redfall, that a new covenant has been created titled Redfall. Obviously it is similar to the Daggerfall covenant as it is an alliance between the kingdoms of High Rock, Orsinium, and now Hammerfell.

The game would take place in both Hammerfell and High Rock during a second Great War. In this war the Dominion is winning and has taken over half or maybe even most of Tamriel. The covenant was created between the kingdoms to defend against the Dominion and it has been working for a few hats but maybe a Dominion spy network is working in the provinces. This faction would be joinable and be a major player in the story.

I think this would be a great spiritual sequel to Daggerfall and would be a really cool story. Seeing the Iliac bay in modern graphics would be amazing. What do you guys think? Would this be a good plot to follow after Skyrim?

Wellington to get 300 new public homes in $296m development [Stuff],"A new public housing development on the capital’s largest social housing site will provide homes for about 900 people.

Housing Minister Megan Woods announced on Thursday a $296 million investment from the Government’s public housing funding to build the Arlington Development in Mt Cook.

All the homes will be public housing to help address the Wellington region’s ongoing housing crisis.

There will be 300 new homes, plus shared amenities such as a playground, a community centre, community gardens, offices, and an orchard.

###Recommendations of the Week
    
###/u/Fazermint

On holiday.
    
###/u/Omegakingauldron

**Venoity** has a solid single here. They're known for being fairly catchy power metal and this being their 5th release they don't seem to be slowing down. Recommended for Majestica fans (the drummer is also part of that band, but the single really reminded me of them)

**Spirits of Fire** is interesting for who's in there. It actually has Fabio Lione as vocalist here (and is the better of the two spots he's in) but for who backs him up, being Mark Zonder, Steve DiGiorgio and Chris Caffery, all of whom have quite the resumes. The song is quite good too, especially if you don't mind Fabio singing in a lower register.

**Star One** is an obvious recommendation from me. I'm more or less all in whenever Arjen Lucassen releases anything. Granted, I'm more excited for the bonus tracks where they switch up all the vocalists. I should also note that this single has Brittney Hayes and Michael Romeo, which isn't even the tip of the iceberg when it comes to guest appearances on this album. Also a fan for Sci-Fi fans.

###/u/JacksonWarrior

I quite enjoyed the **Veonity** single, some good, fast paced EUPM. I've enjoyed previous releases of theirs too so I look forward to this.

I actually like **White Tower**, despite absolutely knowing the vocalist is going to be a turn off for a lot of people. He reminds me a lot of UDO from Accept, but a bit less uh...polished? If you can imagine being less polished than Udo haha. The chant is a bit weird on the timing too, but to me this gives that great ""friends just jamming out some tunes"" heavy metal vibe.

Married gaming couple looking for another gaming couple,"Hello,

My wife and I are looking for another couple currently into tabletop games such as Catan, Dominion, Munchkin, and others to game with. We are in Northwest Ohio and looking to meet up at local game shops such as The Trading Post, the Game Room, or Old School Gaming. We wish to meet up and game once a week, or at least once a month. We also currently do not play Arcadia or Kings of War, but would like to possibly include those two in the rotation as well.",Catan,1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catan/comments/su1kzo/married_gaming_couple_looking_for_another_gaming/,,Z3nabi,su1kzo,/r/Catan/comments/su1kzo/married_gaming_couple_looking_for_another_gaming/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catan/comments/su1kzo/married_gaming_couple_looking_for_another_gaming/,8,2022-02-16
The Zero Soldier Arc (Part 2- To slay a god),"(That episode will have as a cover the mercenary known as Zero Soldier standing in front of Melony in her giant Fierce Deity (or Oni) form, like the Dark Souls MC standing in front of Yhorm the giant, just with Mario standing in her shoulder and Meggy on her other shoulder, and her sword is the Vengeful Deity sword)

It begins with Zero Soldier escaping from Dr. E-Gadd's lab with the Zero's eye after having destroyed it. The Zero's eye begins turning itself into Niles, his alter-ego during the whole college. Niles starts to give him ideas that he's surrounded by just enemies, so he makes him acomplish all of the missions to fight some of the gods that he was naming in a list.

That list has the names of all of the warrios classified as ""gods"" that he neeeds to defeat in combat. One of them is Sephiroth, Goku, Susan, Heavy, Bully Maguire, Arceus and the last one is Melony. He suggests him ""If you want to take your revenge you must know the weakness of your enemies. You can get it through this cool iron mask we got from this old little trash."" He activates a button that shows different gods' weaknesses, the first one being Heavy, who only can get destroyed by being faster in combat and kicking him in the nuts real hard.

He comes to Heavy's house where he was sleeping calmly and he pisses him off by touching his sandwich. Heavy wakes up angrier screaming ""How dare you touching my sandwitch, you little...!?"" and he comes running towards him and dodging his attack, but the battle was really intense and long, but when Heavy almost killed him, he got kicked in the nuts and gets his beloved Sasha while he was screaming in pain yet. Then Heavy recovers himself but lost his gun ""SASHA!!!!"", he tried to get him with his bare hand but he shot him before ending with him defeated.

When he was defeated, Zero Soldier gets Heavy's ammo suply, his power, his own fist and all of his weapons, including his beloved Sasha. ""Congratulations, Rei (Zero in japanese). You are by far worthy of your surname after all, Zero Soldier"" Niles congrats him and Rei begins asking him about his next mission, which is to slay Sephiroth. Unlike Heavy, Niles knows he was too strong and a little fraction of his attack would be deadly enough to destroy even a whole building, being similiar to one fraction of Melony's power, but Rei is confident that he only needs more and better weapons. He gets to Sephiroth who creates an onlyfans now because Sony ended up ruined so he gets unemployeed and he now ""hangs out"" with Cloud while he releases just painful internal screams, similar to Swag and Sonic.

In the restaurant, when Sephiroth is gone, appears in front of Cloud offering him for some help. ""Do you want to free yourself from him? Then hear me out."" He tells him quietly his plans while Cloud was listening closely. When Sephiroth came back, he sits on the chair after apologising himself ""Sorry love, I was just in the bathroom doing my needs."" Cloud faking a smile accepts his apologises while he shows his thumb up, and he gives him an apologise. Sephiroth wonders as Cloud answers this ""For you... To being a sucker"" before Rei shots him right on the head with a gun. Cloud aproaches and runs from here to Rei.

""Sorry Seph, but I have higher expectations. Besides, we were suppoused to be rivals! And I didn't like you anyways!"" Sephiroth's heart gets broken, so he shows his power by destroying the restaurant and turning himself into Safer Sephiroth. ""So that's how it is, right? All I ever wanted was to be in peace with you and stop being your enemy just because our lifejob gets ruined! I had to make myself an onlyfans to survive and all I felt after that day was loneliness AND YOU DARE TO BETRAY ME LIKE THAT!!!"" Sephiroth fights the trio, who gets advantajed physichally, even if Rei filled his whole body with ammo and Niles used all of his powers. ""Even with all of this power isn't enough!? He definitely is good controlling his powers!""

He just realises his weapons are useless against him and when Sephiroth throws them a Genkidama, Rei has fallen down, but didn't find Cloud until he, with thirst for revenge, aproaches his chance to stab him in the nape. When he turns to normal, he falls down and when he tries to get out his sword, Rei shots him and Cloud thanks him for the help when he smiles after killing Sephiroth with just a little help. Suddenly he backstabs Cloud and gets all of his power and the Sephiroth's one because Niles absorbs all of this power and transpasses it to him by one touch.

His next step is to catch Arceus but he needed the Azure flute to do that and be in Mount Coronet in Shinnoh region and Rei thinks this will be a long journey. ""This won't be great problem, don't worry."" Niles uses his psyquic power and teletransports him in the Shinnoh region, next to the Spear Pilar. Niles and Rei steal the Azure Flute, his Arceus phone (A reference to Pokemon Legends Arceus) and many pokeballs from a child whose pokemon he had to defeat before beating him and stealing his money.

Niles touched the flute an specific melody that makes appear many stairs transparent. The stairs are really long unlike their game versions everyone used to. Many steps later, they arrive and they didn't see him anywhere. ""COME OUT, ARCEUS!! YOU FENCED LLAMA, I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE A GOD!!! YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A POKEMON!!! MANIFEST YOURSELF!!!"" Niles screamed in order to find Arceus until Rei saw some golden tables forming a circle whose center shined a golden light shinning more than the sun and taking the form of a llama with two shinny red eyes. ""Boss, you need to look out!!""

The tables and the light were gone when Niles was looking where Rei pointed ""Stop pranking on me! It's a fraud, there's nothing in this place! C'mon, let's get outta here!"" Suddenly the stairs are gone and Niles swears bad words of the frustration. Then a shinning blinds them temporerly and when they recover the view, Arceus stood there menacingly. His roar echoes throught all of the hall as he passes by. ""So is this Arceus? He looks more intimidating now that he's real."" Niles says in a shaky voice.

""So, are you one of all of the usurpers who attempt to disturb my world? Do you have any idea who...!?"" Rei throws a Pokeball at him before his speech for the fist time. ""Is it over? Wow, no wonder why people says he's easy to capture by a child. Hah! What a loser!"" He gets out of the pokeball suddenly and gets angry to them. ""What the hell do you think you're doing!? Look, unlike those games, I am very different to what I have been painted as. NO ONE has defeated-!!"" ""Another one!"" Rei threw another pokeball at him but in vain.

They spent many pokeballs at him and he slowly ends pissed off. ""Would you guys stop!? IT'S ANNOYING!!"" He reaches the breaking point where he uses all of his powers to repel the last pokeballs they were about to throw. Then, he summons an army of legendaries formed by Dialga origin form (More like Dialga with a tumour in the neck), Palkia origin form (Palkia with the body of a centaur without arms) Mega Rayquaza, Mega Mewtwo Y and the legendary pokeman Pengaz.

""Dude, attack them all directly isn't enough. We need to find what's their kryptonite. AND QUICKLY!!!"" Niles and Rei were scared so he presses the button and the only information for each one of them is that they need to weaken them all and then catch them all. They turned themselves into their combat forms and, together, with a few pokeballs, no revivals at all and just their skills in combat they distracted them all until he launches his special attack and shots it to Arceus' head defeating him in one shot. This one was a little troyectile going slow that when it explodes, it leaves massive destruction.

""HOW DARE YOU THROWING ONE PROYECTILE AGAINST ME!? AND DEFEATING ME IN A HUMILLIATING WAY!!??"" He started roaring and everyone in this room except Niles and Rei turned into vital energy, getting consumed by Arceus' body that gets bigger and stronger turning into a more powerful form (it would be similar to this design ""[https://www.deviantart.com/hyshirey/art/Mega-Primal-Arceus-541134772](https://www.deviantart.com/hyshirey/art/Mega-Primal-Arceus-541134772)""). Rei's bombs didn't affect him at all and not even his Sephiroth's powers hurt him so he unleashes his movement Judgement, and they screamed like girls in fear by seeing the giant red proyectiles coming to them until miiraculously a sign of *We'll be right back* appears and saves the day.

""Many unbearable hours later"" The boys get down from the Hall of Origin badly wounded but somehow they managed to catch Arceus thanks to that child's masterball. ""YOU SHOULD USE THE MASTERBALL BEFORE, BOSS!! WE COULD HAVE ENDED THIS FIGHT EASILY!!"" Niles answered like a sargent ""I didn't teach you to complain!! You're a warrior and ""a warrior always gets up stronger no matter how difficult it is"", isn't it what a poor fool said once!?"" Rei gives him the reason after realising how strong he really became after his last and previous battles and he gets a strong pokemon.

""All we left are three, Susan, Maguire and Melony. Before getting to Melony, we need to defeat those two. I take care of Susan and you take care of Maguire."" Rei answers: ""Are you insane!? Maguire is the strongest bully ever!! FIGHT HIM FACE TO FACE IS A SUICIDE!!"" He pushes Niles so strong by the point of making him fly 32 ft (10 metres) away, so in answer Niles launches a powerful energy ball at him in the head that stomps him on the ground. ""DON'T QUESTION ME!! WE WILL GIVE THIS SCORE YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, KAPICHE!? REMEMBER WHO RELEASED YOU FROM THIS LAB AND WILL ALLOW YOU TO GET REVENGE ON THE ONES WHO TOOK RUINED YOUR LIFE ONCE!!"" He nods with the head and turns down when he presses a remote with one button that seems to control him somehow.

Then, while Niles gets to Youtube headquarters, Rei finds Bully Maguire and when he found him, he stands in a throne filled with all of his enemies' skulls in a snowy mountain. Maguire gets up from his throne and gets right to Rei saying he's gonna put some dirt in his eye but he didn't get scared at all. So he answers ""So you must be the one bully that fought one against Shaggy and ended in draw with him. I challenge you to a drip battle."" ""I miss the part where that's my problem, trash!"" He says that but he accepts the challenge asking what will he lose if he wins.

He says that if he loses he will give him a big part of his power and otherwise, if Maguire wins, he will be his maid for one year. He accepts gladly and starts recreating the scene of the dance making it more epic possible. Maguire recreates the same scene increasing the drip, it was so powerful that he made anyone fall in love with him so he wears enough drip that made all the ladies fall in love with him too, the he started dancing freestyle. ""Huh! They love me!""

The public is impacted with his steps, meanwhile Niles fights Susan with her Ban Hammer barely surviving and fighting for the remote and to get her powers. He gets beaten down by Susan but he keeps standing and shoot an energy beam to Susan tearing her away. ""AND NOW THE REMOTE AND YOUR POWER!!!"" Susan refuses and laughs menacingly as if she enjoyed this in her life ""Finally! I found after all this time someone who will be match for me... BUT THIS TIME IT'S OVER!!!"" She unbonds a powerful form that turns her into a god, Niles makes a face of ""Oh, shit!"" after seeing that form that comes to attack him.

Meanwhile, Rei and Maguire ended up in a bed filled with many women and respecting each other. ""Wow! You're pretty good! That's why I need your power!"" He whispers ""Now take on this."" Maguire becomes his friend and gives him part of his power making him invincible now. ""Look at little Maguire Jr!"" He waves at Maguire and gets out of his dominion going back to the city. He only hopes for Niles to defeat Susan or at least not to get banhammered.

Back with Niles, he was beaten down, wounded and tired while Susan Wojira with the Banhammer asked for ""any last words"" before executing him until she stopped moving and the remote's guardian wakes again but this time inside Niles who gets his power after eating the remote he stolen after creating a clone from nowhere. He takes advantage of her paralysis and cuts her into pieces summoning weapons, and then he makes herto move again while the Niles' clone she was fighting against disappears. When she wakes up in her normal form, she gets amazed when the remote guardian appears in front of her.

""Finally, I have the whole power of reality bending! You made this possible by being such a fool!""Susan stares scared at his red aura of power being inmense ""IMPOSIBLE!!! HOW DID YOU GET THIS POWER!!??"" Niles misses the part where that's his problem and prepares a final blow against Susan leaving only weakened. She uses all of her power to recover part of her stolen power and takes the remote away from him, and reactivates the remote.

They reunite themselves inside a bar and tell each other how the fight against their opponents have been. Niles after Rei tells him that he wasn't fighting him physichally while Susan beat him mercilessly felt envy for him. They started talking to each other and plan a strategy to defeat Melony after the beating she gave him and preventing her from turning herself into her Oni form to ""recover his inkweaver"".

Rei has an idea that came in his mind, and is to get a powerful sniper rifle and reloading it with radioactive ammo and to cover the laser pointer so she doesn't notice the sniper. And Niles buy many weapons more, including a bomb-omb and puts him inside a box while he's asleep. Niles tells him that this was his house which was stolen and points at Melony with his finger.

""That girl!? But she's cute and sexy!! She is living happily, why killing her?"" He answers that she isn't what she seems calling her a ""demon"". He proves this to him by sending her a replique of him but with the eyes of Zero instead. She turns herself bersherk and destroys completely the Rei's illusion and burns it down. Rei gives him the reason and believes she is the enemy that needs to be destroyed and says ""Let's do it!"" Rei prepares the rifle and Niles makes an illusion of them being invisibles to her and the box he saves for the last moment. For now, Rei aims at Melony's head and shots Melony in the signal of fire.
