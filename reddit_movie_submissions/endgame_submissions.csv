Avengers: Endgame - 4 Original Avengers Sacrifice Theory (New Trailer),"So I just watched the new Avengers: Endgame trailer like 5 times in the past 10 minutes and there's something uniquely strange about it. If you's can remember there was a theory going around that only 2 of the original 6 Avengers will survive at the end of Endgame. If you listen to the new trailer, you'll notice 4 of the original Avengers say the line, 'Whatever it takes'. The 4 that say this are Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye/Ronin and lastly Iron Man. Could these be the 4 original members that sacrifice their lives to save everyone?

Let's break it down, Chris Evans' contract is up after this movie, same with RDJ. The Russo Brothers said Hawkeye would have a big arc in Avengers: Endgame that all Hawkeye fans would enjoy (what bigger arc than laying down your life, to bring your family and half of all life back?) And as for Black Widow, her movie is guaranteed to be a prequel now (maybe Budapest?).

The Russo Brothers also said Captain America: Civil War would prove to be a fundamental part in Endgame. The 4 Avengers that repeated that phrase in the new trailer happen to all feature in Civil War while the other 2 original Avengers (Thor and Hulk) that didn't repeat the phrase, are not in Civil War.

All in all I just found it interesting how only 4 of the original 6 Avengers repeated this phrase as if they're willing to do 'whatever it takes' to restore balance to the universe. Let me know what you's think :D",FanTheories,1449,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/b1001k/avengers_endgame_4_original_avengers_sacrifice/,Marvel,TheRealBrandini97,b1001k,/r/FanTheories/comments/b1001k/avengers_endgame_4_original_avengers_sacrifice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/b1001k/avengers_endgame_4_original_avengers_sacrifice/,261,2019-03-14

"DE, in your patchnotes you refer to Vauban as a victim of damage creep","...when a far more blatant issue for him is that half of Fortuna and other endgame content (Arbis) got CC immunity. You robbed him of his power - continuously - without any compensation.

You're right when you say that buffing damage isn't always a solution, but if you're taking away a warframes ability to reliably crowd control it *does* need some sort of compensation.

(Note that I'm not saying that Vauban needs straight damage buffs, actually I'm more for [creative solutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/8ogbl2/vauban_rework_concept_synergies_thunderdomes/) ).

All I want to say is - in your patch notes Vauban was a pretty weak excuse for Mesa nerfs.

You will then be prompted to download and install Title Update 1; expect a 48-52 GB download, depending on your region and preferred language. Whether you installed the game from a disc or bought it digitally, the final HDD install size, including the patch, will be 48-52 GB.

**PS4:** If you purchased a physical copy of the game, begin installing from the disc. Provided you are online, your console will simultaneously download Title Update 1 while you install it. Expect a 48-52 GB download for Title Update 1, depending on your region and preferred language. If you purchased a digital copy of the game, expect a 88-92 GB download that comprises both the game and Title Update 1. Whether installed from a disc or downloaded digitally, the final HDD install size will be between 88-92 GB.

##Known Issues

###Having audio issues?
The Division 2 team is aware of numerous reports regarding audio issues within The Division 2. We are currently working to resolve these issues as soon as possible. In the meantime, we do have a few workarounds available for audio issues on PC  
  
If you are having audio issues, we generally recommend [these PC steps](https://support.ubi.com/en-us/faqs/000025947). We especially recommend doing a clean install of your audio drivers and [disabling extra background applications](https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/Faqs/000025721/Disabling-Background-Application/). One player found that [disabling VOIP](https://support.ubi.com/en-US/faqs/000041357/Disabling-VoIP-in-The-Division-2-TD2) has resolved this issue for them. Restarting your game every once in a while may also resolve this issue.  
  
If you use a Logitech headset, we recommend [disabling the Logitech Surround Sound Service](https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/Faqs/000025721/Disabling-Background-Application/). Another player provided the following workaround:  
\- Keep your headset plugged in.  
\- Go to ""Device Manager"".  
\- Search for your headset under Audio Controller.  
\- Remove the device.  
\- Unplug your headset, and wait a few seconds.  
\- Plug your headset back in  
\- Restart your PC after Device Manager has recognized your headset.  
\- Go to the Logitech Software and try the sample surround.  
  
If you are still having audio issues after trying all of these steps, please submit your [MSINFO and dxdiag files](https://support.ubi.com/en-US/Faqs/Details/kA030000000emSbCAI?name=how-to-submit-dxdiag-and-msinfo-files) through our [support portal](http://support.ubi.com/Cases/New). Please include the following information on your ticket:  
\- The model of the headset you are currently using  
\- What driver version are you running?  
\- What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?

###Acknowledged Issues
These issues have been acknowledged in the State of the Game, by the developers or through other official channels: 

&amp;nbsp;

#####**Fixes in Progress**

* World Tier 3 to 4 Progression Block. 

   * Avoid doing Strongholds that progress you in the next World Tier with players that are on different World Tiers.     

   * The workaround that **MIGHT** work: Group up with someone that is on the same World Tier and about to progress into the next. Keep in mind, that all in the group also have the correct Gear Score. A fix is in progress. 
* There is a Weapon Skin Bug. 

   * When you sell a weapon with a weapon skin attached to it, that weapon skin can be lost. They are working on a fix. 
   * Deconstructing weapons with a Weapon Skin attached does not cause the skin to be lost. When that happened, use the buy-back weapon or contact Ubi-Support, when you lost a skin that you bought with your own money.

Why you may ask? Well, it’s not for the regular loot, of course, but for the KEYS. In most sewers contain one or more key cabinets that have faction-specific keys that can be used to open up small loot containers in missions (ex. True Sons key opens a True Sons box).
&gt; u/x_Reign
PSA: Save those keys until you are in the endgame because low-level high ends are completely useless
&gt; u/NoNoPiracy
The sewer right outside the Lincoln Memorial (near the SHD cache to the east) had legitimately 10+ key containers on the walls. It was honestly the first sewer I went in so I'm not sure if that's the norm, but dang, it had a lot of keys. It also had a crap ton of loot, too.

- **PSA: Maximum obtainable gear score is tied to your current items, *including* stash. Keep high score items for better loot!**

Retweeted by Fredrik, so seems to be legit. This is useful to know...
“GearScore for loot drops is based on your max attainable own GearScore from all items owned, including your stash. Just hold on to items with higher GearScore, you don't need to equip them to still get better drops”

- **Ivory Chest Reward Showcase** might include spoilers
The chest located in the White House by the barber requires 8 ivory keys which are dropped randomly by hunters alongside their masks. I managed to get enough keys and here is the weapon you get from opening it. Alongside that, you get a white weapon shader and hunter's axe backpack trophy.
Warning: The weapon drops at your current world tier with random perks (no intrinsic perk). In addition, you also don't get a blueprint. So if you wanna use this gun at world tier 5, don't open it 'till you reach it.

"Bring against Captain Marvel saving the day in Avengers Endgame isn’t being anti-woman, it’s being anti-bad storytelling","We’ve all been following Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor for ten years.  We’ve watched them grow and change; and grown and changed with them ourselves. This is their story, and they deserve to be the victors. Captain Marvel’s been around for a month. We have no connection to her. Having Captain Marvel pop in and save the day is cheap storytelling. A deus ex machina that destroys the previous storytelling. It has nothing to do with her being a woman. I think most people would feel the same way if 

Imagine if lJK Rowling introduces a brand new character in the last 50 pages of Deathly Hallows, called Digleby Widdlesworth, and it turns out he’s the key to defeating Voldemort.  Not just that, but he actually defeats Voldemort and all Harry has to do is thank him. People would be rightly angry because it’s poor storytelling

Now, we don’t know if that’s what’s going to happen in the movie, but that’s one of the rumors. And I don’t think people that are against it are against women or women heroes. They’re just against bad storytelling.",unpopularopinion,85,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b16rz1/bring_against_captain_marvel_saving_the_day_in/,,HuxTales,b16rz1,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b16rz1/bring_against_captain_marvel_saving_the_day_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b16rz1/bring_against_captain_marvel_saving_the_day_in/,28,2019-03-14

"A talented artist by the name of Benjamin Ratterman has come up with a concept for a total revamp of most D2 vendors, and its amazing.","For those of you who don’t know, Benjamin does a lot of cool Destiny concepts (a while back after Warmind released he designed additional IKELOS weapons that came out amazing). He just finished his newest project which is an endgame concept for all the planetary vendors as well as vendors like Ikora and the faction vendors that didn’t get an update with Forsaken. He’s given them all updated armour sets and a pinnacle weapon to chase. This is incredible work and would drastically improve the quality of life of the endgame. Bungie take notes! u/dmg_04

Realizing the endgame of Red Pill,"I found red pill after a brutal breakup a few years ago which caused me to question everything.

At first a lot of the lessons were real helpful about self-improvement, chasing excellence and being the best version of yourself. A lot of these lessons I will carry with me for the rest of my life. 

From these wholesome ideals came a lot of baggage from other men who were broken from tough relationships &amp; marriages that caused you to question everything. A lot of men trying to find answers to fractured hearts, Red Pill becomes a cult in that it attempts to answer a lot of tough questions you had for yourself in these moments.  I have fought within myself about red pill. I knew the misogyny aspect was completely wrong, my mother loves me dearly and believed in me the most when I was developing slowly at a young age due to having water in my ear tubes, causing me to be unable to hear and be distant as a toddler. If women were truly evil, I’d have been cast aside at the first moment of difficulty.

Red Pill puts you in a loop of attracting the wrong kinds of women in your life, perpetuating the tenets of Red Pill. I know I have hurt women who I know were interested in me because I became everything I strived to run from in the Red Pill. I knew one girl that was attracted to me that I drove so insane with red pill antics she would post pictures of herself walking in the woods to “clear her head.”  After some bullshit I did to her deliberately thinking I would be creating attraction. I knew this to be when she invited me to a party with her new boyfriend before she moved just to ignore me deliberately, perhaps to embarrass me in the way I did her. Deep down I know I messed up, she is a great woman. I became so focused on abundance, I forgot what I really wanted in the first place. I still feel a sense of shame for this, and in setting the precedent of being a total manipulative sleaze, she reacted in kind.

I lost my hair at a young age so I turned to a few bald youtubers, one of them being Richard from Entrepreneurs in Cars. He had a great, empowering video about going bald that I would use as a frame of reference whenever I felt that my bald head held me back from the life I wanted. However in realizing that idolatry is reserved for God and not for us humans with vices and flaws, he was consumed in Red Pill and seeing him being hurt from a divorce and running to red pill was a part of me waking up. He had a podcast where he was shouting down some callers who were striving to find themselves and they happened to disagree with a Red Pill logic.

I have come to realize, like any cult, they will have a series of wholesome tenets to rally behind, only to sink you into a reality that does not suit your endgame. A lot of Red Pill men are always in constant contemplation of the next steps in life and perpetuate bad habits because how they act attracts everything they strive to run away from. 

I will not make the same mistakes again, and I will strive to rid myself of the misogynistic mess of Red Pill and will take the good tenets and live a great life. I will face the good, bad and ugly and take reality for what it is.",exredpill,55,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/exredpill/comments/b0vxvb/realizing_the_endgame_of_red_pill/,,phillyforgetmenot,b0vxvb,/r/exredpill/comments/b0vxvb/realizing_the_endgame_of_red_pill/,https://www.reddit.com/r/exredpill/comments/b0vxvb/realizing_the_endgame_of_red_pill/,6,2019-03-14

How I broke the spear meta,"Hey guys, Zyrk here. Some claim me to be the greatest archer and even one of the best players in this game. I don’t know about those claims, but it has been fun playing archer with really skilled players on private servers. Recently I’ve been asked by many members of the Conan community to reveal my secrets. I’m now making a guide to give back to the community and hoping to inspire other people to find ways to break the insanely boring spear meta. This guide includes some video references.  
I first began playing Conan Exiles in the summer of 2018. With a quite competitive background I quickly found myself fighting for big boy status on private servers. Late 2018 I grew tired of the spear meta and wanted to try something else. Pet system and special arrows were introduced in October of 2018 and I began researching the possibility of running archery builds in team fights. The aim (pun intended) was to help team fights end faster, have a decent way to chase down runners and add more utility to my clan.   
**When reading this guide please keep in mind that this build is not very newbie friendly. It is very late game oriented and requires a decent knowledge of the game and quite a bit of farming to make it work.** 

**Shoutout to my clan: Rekt, Suspect, Karla, Nasty, Greenie and the “new boys” Wellu, Koopee, Preda and Schukki.**  


\------------  
**Gear, buffs, inventory**  
**Equipped items**

![img](a1kkte9v96m21 ""The usual pvp gear"")

Everything is always flawless and epic  
Weapon: Eye of Khan / Huntress. If not available, pictish bow.   
Helmet: Flawless aquilonian infantry + Any sort of gas mask (sandstorm/set/commander). This piece can be medium and you can still have light rolls.  
Chest: Always khitan mercenary  
Legs: Always khitan mercenary  
Boots: Always khitan mercenary  
Gloves: khitan mercenary OR if I know I’m fighting in hot areas, darfari light / pictish wizard  
On medium helmet I put armor reduction kit, gas mask I use flexibility kits for increased climbing. You never know when you need to climb high. On all other light pieces I use thick armor plating for that few extra % of armor reduction. On bows I use the advanced weapon damage kit. Archery damage scales amazingly with weapon + arrow damage, armor penetration doesn’t seem to work.   
Now I know with the new unnamed city named items you can make better builds, but on the hardcore endgame pvp servers that I play on, it is simply not worth to grind those items just to lose them in a fight to some bullshit luck/glitch/bug/whatever.  


**Let’s talk about buffs**

My specs require you to be fully buffed. You take crimson powder, purple lotus potion and golden lotus potion to buff you with strength, vitality and grit. Use the items in that order. Then you take elixir of grace, elixir of encumbrance, elixir of sight, elixir of freedom, hunter’s potion and warpaint vitality.  
Sometimes you want to keep another set of buffs with you. This is especially important if you are raiding someone. Keep in mind these stored buffs in your inventory increase your encumbrance.

**Utility items**

So, what do I bring with me to fights and raids?  
\- Snake arrows and Serpent-man arrows are your backbone. I take at least 400 arrows of these in total. Sometimes 300 snake 100 serpent-man, sometimes other way around. Test what you feel is good for you.   
\- Explosive and poison arrows. You need these to finish off your targets, take down anti climbs, etc. I normally take take 3-4 stacks of both. If I know there will be lots of anti climb to shoot down, I take as much as necessary. One anti climb takes 3 stacks of both.   
\- Feast of set. This is an OP heal in my opinion. It heals slightly less than a roasted haunch, but it also works as an antidote. It will remove all poisons and bleeds off you, then start healing you. Other option is to use Spiced Sliver for the antidote effect and then use a good food like hearty stew. I don’t like this option because it takes one slot from your already maxed out hotbar.  
\- Herbal tea. Use this AFTER you use feast of set to heal even more.  
\- Elixir of freedom. If you get crippled in a dangerous situation, you use this to remove the cripple.   
\- Star metal pickaxe. You never know when you have to chop down some wood/rocks or get rid of corpses. Also if you have reaper poison with you, you can poison the pickaxe and kill someone in the water by applying tons of poison to him. People don’t usually expect this and they think they are safe in the water.  
\- Repair hammer, to inspect the health of buildings you will be destroying.   
\- Fiber bedroll, so if you die to falls or other unlucky things, you can get back there quickly.  
\- Dragonpowder, earthenware jugs, tar. Do not premake bombs, they weight a lot. You use bombs to destroy buildings or to bomb pvp. More on that later.  
\- Quivering arrows, if you have any. You get these from unnamed city but they are a rare drop. They deal an insane amount of damage though and can kill off targets very easy. Use them wisely. 

\--------------------

**Spec (Attribute points)**  
I tested out all attribute bonuses (stuff you get every 10 points). Turns out many of them were and still are bugged, for example 40 archery points does not increase armor penetration like it says and salting the wounds (20 str points) did not work last week. However the most important ones that worked and still work are 40 vitality (increased healing effects), 40 grit (decreases stamina used per arrow fired), 50 grit (rolls take less stamina), 10 agility (sprinting takes less stamina),  20 encumbrance (cripples are not as bad), 10 archery (arrows cripple effect is stronger) and 20 archery (arrows ricochet off the ground). Always test out what works and does not work. **Funcom unfortunately tends to break their stuff every patch, so test these out after every patch.**  


**My current pvp build with eye of khan / huntress**

10 agility

40 vitality (with gas mask)

31 accuracy  
50 grit

20 encumbrance  
**If +5 accuracy bow not available, I either run the above build but with lower accuracy or this**  
10 agility

40 vitality

31 accuracy

40 grit

31 encumbrance

Sometimes you want to spec 30 encumbrance even with eye of khan available if you know you have to run around with lots of bombs or utility arrows.   
**If salting the wounds and crevice in the armor (20 str 40 accuracy) are working as intended and you want to trade your mobility to more damage output (roughly 40% more vs. light armor) this is with +5 accuracy bow ofcourse**  
20 str

40 vitality  
40 accuracy  
40 grit  
20 encumbrance  


\-------------------

**Playstyle, your position in fights etc.**

So you farmed all your stuff, you are buffed up, inventory is loaded. What do you do?  
I think archers work best in team fights. You as the archer can help your spear player team members. I sometimes regard myself as the support player of the my clan. Soloing with archer is also great and I can easily take down any spear players. The best part is, if you feel unsafe, you can just outrun everyone with your 10 agility and 40+ grit.   
Most important thing to understand is that your arrows **cripple** your opponent if you shoot them in the legs. The cripple last for like two seconds. I’ve seen an increasing number of players playing without 20 encumbrance in their spec, so those people are your first targets. They are in trouble if you chain some cripple to their feet. With cripples you make room for your spear players to move in and get some free hits in or at least force enemy players to waste rolls and run out of stamina. Cripple arrows are also great to kill off runners.  
All arrows cripple. Serpent-man arrows deal a decent amount of damage, but you might want to mix some snake arrows in there. Now with the recent change to how reaper poison works, everyone has a million billion antidotes with them so snake arrows are not as good anymore. Still, use some snake arrows to catch your enemies off guard and make them waste their antidotes.  
Now, explosive and poison arrows. These deal an ok amount of damage if you hit your opponent with them, but they deal damage even if you miss them and hit the ground near them. I always use explosive arrow first, then poison arrow. Explosive arrow splash damage does little damage, but when you shoot a poison to that explosive arrow effect, it creates a mini explosion and deal good amount of damage in the area. This is great to finish of low health opponents, kill players stuck in holes, force players to abandon their position, etc. 

Now add **bomb pvp**. You can shoot explosive arrows around, creating the little “fire zones” they leave behind. You can then place a bomb in those fire zones to instantly ignite the bombs. This deals huge amounts of damage if your opponent happens to be close to those fire zones. If you have a friend ready to place bombs in your fire zones, its gg for your opponent.  
You might wanna ask me about **powershots**. Powershots increase your arrow damage and makes the arrow fly faster and further away, but it takes a while to load. I only use powershots if I have to shoot really far away and the target is standing still. Otherwise powershots are not worth it in my opinion.   
What about **target lock**? I personally never use target lock, because it can’t predict the enemy movement like a human can. Also it does not aim for legs.   
You will be targeted by enemy spear players when you enter the battlefield. You can run with your big stamina pool or try to fight them off. The way I deal with spear players is by shooting them in the feet once or twice, roll, repeat. They usually run out of stamina before me and that’s when I get to regen my stamina. Check my clips for a better explanation.  


Moving while shooting makes your arrows less accurate. If your opponent is closeby, you can keep moving, but if you want to hit things a little further away, you have to stop every time you are firing.    
In the end it really boils down to you predicting your enemy movement, having good reflexes and landing those shots in your enemies feet. With practice you will learn! Good luck.  
My playstyle is easier to understand by looking at my videos.

\--------------  
**Videos**

Here are some clips to see the build in action. I’m not making a pvp movie out of these for now, so these are just rough cuts from my plays.tv clips.   


First raid day of battleborn pvp event on 9.3.2019. The server had very good clans around, so we were excited to see the competition. Some could claim that most of the top EU players participated. First day we raided three different clans, here are my highlights. [https://plays.tv/video/5c885218a4538f7be5/battleborn-pvp-day-1](https://plays.tv/video/5c885218a4538f7be5/battleborn-pvp-day-1)  


We raided the last remaining clan for two days. Our best opponents yet and the toughest raid I’ve ever been in. Here are my highlights from the second day. [https://plays.tv/video/5c883e827aa3fbafa0/dildoparty-vs-earthernware-jug-day-2](https://plays.tv/video/5c883e827aa3fbafa0/dildoparty-vs-earthernware-jug-day-2)  


Last video is from old patch, where we raided a known clan called Darfari Madness. Insane raid with lots of action, another clan counter raiding us etc. Showing my highlights from that night in this clip [https://plays.tv/video/5c5f6f88e33ae135bd/disney-vs-darfari](https://plays.tv/video/5c5f6f88e33ae135bd/disney-vs-darfari)

\-----------------------

**Other tips, tricks and secrets**

I always thought about making a guide about stuff that I found out during my 1,5k hours in conan. So to add to this guide, here are some more or less related tips and tricks. Obviously there are very shady glitches that I know about but I won’t be posting them here. The stuff I post here is in my opinion ok to use on any servers, if not stated otherwise  


**Respec faster**  
So I saw a video of someone playing the game on xbox and I found out that they have a button to put in 10 attribute points at a time. I searched the game files if we had such an option on PC and sure enough I found what I wanted, but it was not bound to anything by default and it can’t be bound through the conan settings menu. So you have to do this manually yourself. Your hotkey settings are stored in a file called **Input.ini** and you can find it in  
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Conan Exiles\\ConanSandbox\\Saved\\Config\\WindowsNoEditor  
Now you want to add this line to that file. Replace the K in “Key=K” as you wish. ActionMappings=(ActionName=""BuyUpToNextPerk"",Key=K,bShift=False,bCtrl=False,bAlt=False,bCmd=False)  
Now open your attribute menu in the game, hover over the attribute that you want to spend points on and press the key you bound, in my case K. You should spend 10 points with a single click.   


**Encumbrance**  
Don’t worry about the color indicator of your encumbrance meter. It is wrong. Only things you need to know is that if you are under 50% encumbered, you are doing very good. If you are between 50%-89% encumbered, you drain slightly more stamina while running but this is fine. I am almost always 50-89 encumbered because I have to carry so much stuff with me to fights. If you are over 90% though you are gonna drain your stamina really fast, get rid of something asap. Over 100% you are dead ofcourse. 

**Map room things**

If someone starts a teleport with a map room, you can snatch that teleport by pressing any of the teleport objects on the map room. This also means you can teleport to obelisks that you have no yet unlocked. Just tell a friend to click the teleport and then spam the teleport button yourself.   
**Auto sprint**  
So you might know about auto run. This is something you can bind through the keybind settings in game. What if you want to auto sprint? Easy. First activate your auto run. Now start sprinting by pressing your sprint button. Press nothing else. Now click open any menu, map, etc. You get stuck on auto sprint. This will stay until you you press your sprint button again. While auto sprinting, you can click map room teleport. This way you can teleport but you don’t have to stop. Nice way to get away from people chasing you.

**Flying rhinos and other big things.**

You killed a rhino and want to skin it, but it flew away a thousand miles on your screen. This is related to unreal engine and your FPS. Cap your fps to 60 or lower from the game settings so that they only make a little jump instead of taking off to the moon.

**Testing out stuff**  
Test out everything in single player before you try it out on servers. Stuff usually works the same on single. To make life easier, learn to open the console command line. Some useful command lines  
\&gt;makemeadmin (password) | gives you admin privilege  
\&gt;god  | godmode  
\&gt;fly | makes you fly  
\&gt;Slomo (0-100)      |  Makes your game run slower or faster. 1 is the default. This is amazing because it lets you fly “faster” than the default speed. Also helps with other things.   
**Long jump / spear roll / whatever you call it**  
Please note this particular trick is considered cheating on some private servers. However you can see it in some of my clips because some servers allow it. It gives a cool new element and raises the skill cap, much like bunny hopping in FPS games. The idea is to have something in your hand like a spear, roll off a cliff/foundation/any edge, and right as you cross the edge in your roll you unsheathe your weapon. This makes you jump a very big distance.   
These are just some of the useful things that come to my mind. Hopefully this guide gave you something! If people like it, I would consider writing guides about other things like leveling, farming, base locations, raiding, etc.

The reason why endgame isn't enjoyable anymore - the original league/endgame design has shifted.,"I've been taking a small break from Synthesis because it feels so unrewarding, but in reality my enjoyment in PoE has shifted ever since Incursion.  When a friend linked me this comment chain, it just clicked for me why I can't enjoy PoE as much as I did before: https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/b1ii5n/the_constant/eim0rc9/


___


Take a look at https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/League


There are three sections of leagues/endgame I would like to point out:

* **Point 1**: Leagues adding simple flavors to maps

* **Point 2**: Leagues and core content to trickle up to some grander content (usually bosses) and can be stored for future usage (can run later and you won't lose rewards)

* **Point 3**: Leagues and core content to trickle up to some grander content and cannot be stored for future usage (must run now or lose future rewards)


___


**Point 1: Leagues adding simple flavors to maps**


A lot of leagues were designed with maps in mind, and you would engage with the league content inside maps.  Every league between Anarchy/Onslaught (June 2016) and before Breach (Dec 2016) came as some new content inside maps or story zones EXCEPT Talisman.  I would say Talisman falls under **Point 2**.  Anarchy/Onslaught, Domination/Nemesis, Ambush/Invasion, Rampage/Beyond, Torment/Bloodlines, Warbands/Tempest, Perandus, Prophecy, Essence were simple flavors added to maps but the endgame didn't really change: we just ran maps and that was it.


___


**Point 2: Leagues and core content to trickle up to some grander content (usually bosses) and can be stored for future usage (can run later and you won't lose rewards)**

Since before leagues even launched, all we really had was dominus farming and maps.  The ""true endgame"" was of course maps at this time.  This ""true endgame"" had a cost: maps.  To run maps, you need to use up a map.  We all know this and it's very well integrated into the game design and a lot of content:

* You need Sac/Mortal frags to run Atziri - but you can store as many frags as you want

* You need Guardian frags to run Shaper - but you can store as many frags as you want

* You need specific maps to run Elder/Uber Elder - but you can store as many frags as you want


You can also store as many maps as you want.  All leagues between Breach and Incursion falls under this point and including Talisman.  Talisman, Breach, Legacy, Harbinger, Abyss, Bestiary all contributed to giving you ""fragments"" so you can run something ""bigger"" (Talisman - Rigwald, Breach - Breachstones, Legacy - leaguestones, Harbinger - Beachheads, Bestiary - bosses).  It gets a little murky with Abyss but the more you ran it, the more bosses you met.  Abyss can fall under point 1 instead as well.

You can store as many talismans, breachstones, leaguestones, beachheads, bestiary bosses, etc as you wanted and you can run it all at a later time without losing rewards.

___


**Point 3: Leagues and core content to trickle up to some grander content and cannot be stored for future usage (must run now or lose future rewards)**

All previous leagues before Incursion, Delve, Betrayal, and Synthesis did not serve to ""force"" you to run content.  These 4 leagues do:

* Incursion: To run and reap the rewards of Incursion, you must run 11 map incursions then finally run a temple.  If you did not run the temple, you lost all future rewards from this content.

* Delve: To run Delve, you need to farm maps for sulphite until you capped out.  If you capped out, you would get no sulphite and would miss all rewards from the sulphite you missed.

* Betrayal: To run Betrayal NORMALLY (I'm ignoring the whole 'save Fortifications and Transportation safehouses and run only Research/Intervention' strategy), you need to run safehouses until you ran the Mastermind.  If you did not run Safehouses, you would not see the Mastermind.  I realize it gets trickier here because eventually a bunch of people stopped doing the Mastermind as it was better to control your board and maximize profits.

* Synthesis: To run Synthesis, you run 10 maps and if you successfully got the memory fragments in all maps, you'd need to go to the memory nexus to reap the rewards otherwise the fragments will get overwritten and you lose it.

All of those 4 leagues force you to continually pause mapping and run some content to continue reaping the rewards of that content.  While I/we all realize that the player has a choice to NOT run such content, it is usually detrimental in terms of gathering loot and currency as Incursion, Delve, and Betrayal are some of the most rewarding leagues we have ever experienced.  Skipping it is not an exception, and it is precisely because of this we don't feel good if we skip such content in favor of not being interrupted or enjoying something else more.  Synthesis currently isn't that rewarding, but in a few weeks it may very well be if GGG makes some changes, and after that you'll want to run the memory nexus every 10 maps and go through the small stress of needing to track memory charges, decayed memories, pathways, etc.


___


**Ending Notes**

I believe the majority of players enjoy not having to interrupt something they are doing in order to maximize rewards and not miss out on future rewards.  I am not a game designer, but I feel like if they converted Incursion temples into some ""map"" you could store, removed Delve sulphite cap, gave Safehouses as maps, and removed cap on memories (or something, not sure), people would be happier as they can run temples when they feel like it, Delve when they feel like it, Safehouses when they feel like it, etc.


___



**TLDR: Forcing the player to pick between doing content NOW or potentially missing out on future rewards from that same content is not an interesting choice.**",pathofexile,844,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/b1kabh/the_reason_why_endgame_isnt_enjoyable_anymore_the/,,deafgamer_,b1kabh,/r/pathofexile/comments/b1kabh/the_reason_why_endgame_isnt_enjoyable_anymore_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/b1kabh/the_reason_why_endgame_isnt_enjoyable_anymore_the/,368,2019-03-15

Power Scaling Rebuttal: Why loot matters more than ever (Better Math),"This is a rebuttal to a popular post on the [front page right now](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b1bcbx/powerscaling_why_loot_doesnt_matter_anymore_math/). While that post provides some incredibly useful data points, it unfortunately resorts to a very misleading title and a fundamentally flawed premise to make its point.

These following bullet points describe the real state of loot:

\- **Gear score only affects Melee Damage, Ult Damage, and the Damage from MW bonuses that are applied as a separate damage source (e.g. Thunderbolt of Yvennia). If you do not care about those damage types for your build (e.g. weapon-focused builds, skill-focused builds), then the post is completely irrelevant.** 

\- The post only describes how to maximize the BASE damage of your melee/ult damage. While that is an important number for the endgame, it only makes up a fraction of what's important for your endgame build. Even ignoring the obvious survivability issues of playing with no components, damage output is still extremely dependent on other stats beyond base damage. Which leads to the obvious conclusions that...

\- A healthy mix of Masterworks and Legendaries will give you the strongest melee/ult based build, the strength of such a build is more dependent on specific skills, components, and inscriptions and scales even better than previous weapon-based builds (because +Ult Speed, +Skill Speed, and +Damage all synergize more effectively than weapon damage bonuses which were linear in nature and crit was the only true multiplier). 

While I agree that it's a big problem that Bioware is not being transparent about these calculations and that their system of not including level 1's in an average is silly and needs to go, that doesn't excuse promoting deceptive statements about how the new system works. Here is a chart offering a rough picture of how scaling truly works for an ult-based Ranger (or Interceptor) with favorable assumptions for the ""1 million damage ranger"" (Sigils, +25% javelin damage on the legendary):

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/b1wxmwh5nbm21.png

The three ""color"" comparisons you see here are basically:

1) 35/Purple = A full set of epics that have perfect rolls for ult damage/charge time

2) 61/Orange = A full set of masterworks that have good rolls for ult damage/charge time

3) 75/Yellow = The ""1 million damage Ranger"", with 1 decently rolled legendary (or 9 weak legendary rolls, doesnt matter)

The 62-74 range just illustrates the effect of shifting from ""well rolled Masterworks"" to legendaries with no synergy (or unequipped that slot entirely so as to not bring down the average gear score). There are some assumptions baked in like having each Last Argument/Venom Spray build 20% ult charge, and having the support skill excluded from the MW/Leg sets... but the simple fact is that no matter how you tweak the numbers, a well-balanced MW set will trounce a cheesy ""1 million damage Ranger"". There are other ""realities"" that have to be accounted for too, like survivability, weapon damage, certain MW bonuses... but ALL of those factors will significantly favor a synergistic and well-rolled MW set over a Legendary set that either runs empty slots or random legendaries with no build synergy. 

**The reality of gear-scaled builds is simply this:**

**MW with synergistic rolls &gt; Non-synergized Legendary &gt;&gt;&gt; Any epic, regardless of roll.**

The loot matters a LOT for these builds and you'll have to make many difficult choices about whether to prioritize gear score over damage/skill speed/ult speed for a given slot. ""The 1 million damage Ranger"" makes a big fuss about how his 350% blast build (achieved through epics) hits for less than a 1-legendary Ranger but using that distinction to conclude ""Loot doesn't matter"" when the real endgame is usually comparing Legendaries with poor rolls to Masterworks with good rolls is incredibly deceptive. The real conclusion of his work was that epics with amazing rolls are not worth using in a gear-scaled build, but that is no more shocking than saying that an epic Devastator with a max +Damage% roll is still worse than a legendary Tarsis with no damage roll.

Division 2 Leveling / Gear Grinding - Do's and Dont's! Guide,"**Hello One And All I Go By Esscrin!**

So as i See it There's Some Stuff You Do and Don't Want to Do Tell End Game so Lets Start!

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Don't skip ahead in the main quests to play with friends!**  

As of 3/15/2019, there are several bugs right now that can slow or even stop progression if you do things out of order. 

When Ubisoft releases patches for the game in the future, things will likely get better, but as of now what you should 

do is play the missions as they become available and enjoy the story and lore until you hit level 30, at which point 

progression bugs stop being that large of an issue. If you're interested in accessing the endgame as fast as possible, 

you can join a friend with a higher gearscore to get your own up faster. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Collect faction keys and save them up for endgame!** 

The faction specific boxes they open (they look like ammo boxes with faction paint on them) drop gear that scales with

world tier, so save them until you start farming exotics at endgame. Even high-end drop rates are quite generous! 

(at this time i can not confirm that the boxes Drop Exotic Gear or Classified Set Gear)                      

This Gamer Had A ""Talk With A Dev"" and they told him there will be Brand sets and Gear Sets

[https://twitter.com/SkillUpYT/status/1007519226242859008](https://twitter.com/SkillUpYT/status/1007519226242859008)

 

**3. Donate to projects as you get them!** 

They give you blueprints for useful gear, mods, and weapons, so save any excess gear drops and donate them 

to project managers when you have the opportunity.  
**4. Don't open and loot supply rooms in control points until endgame!** 

Once again, they drop gear that scales with world tier, and the yellow SHD caches are one of the only places that 

can drop gear that has over 450 gear score.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Grab all the SHD Tech caches as they become available!** 

They will allow you to learn more skills and perks, and grabbing them early will save you from having to grab them   
once enemies get stronger at endgame. 

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Remember to mod your gear, guns AND skills!** 

Yes, you can mod all three, and skill mods have a skill-power requirement before they are activated. 

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Avoid doing activities unless you need them for a project!** 

The time investment in doing them isn't worth the small amount of experience and loot you get from them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**8. Save side missions for the last 5 levels!** 

By the time you hit the end of the main story missions, you should be around level 24-25, and will only have

strongholds left to do. Side missions are really helpful to boost your level, as they always provide one third of your

level as experience.   

(For instance if you need 300k exp to level up, side missions will provide 100k Exp) 

&amp;#x200B;

**9. Save Dark Zone missions for endgame!** 

If you wait until level 30 you can do the missions and get easy gear, as all of the NPCs won't spawn and other players

won't bother you. Landmark caches do not open, but you can take the time to learn each map and get free gear

along the way! 

&amp;#x200B;

**10. Gearing up at endgame!**

So to gear up fast after you Complete the last Stronghold you can do this 2 way's! 

1. To advance through each world tier up to WT4, you need to clear a Stronghold and the two missions needed to 

access it, and also hit a certain gear score which you can see on the map. Complete each of the two missions and   
a few control points afterward is one of the faster ways to get the necessary gear score.

2. or you can just have a friend boost you by having you join his server then do Strongholds, Control Point's            
Bounty's for better gear. this way is the fasts way i have found.  

&amp;#x200B;

**11. Skill's to start out with!** 

Flame turret provides fantastic crowd control even against juggernaut enemies, and both the reinforcer chem

launcher and fixer drone (Drone seams to bug out and crash the game 3/15/2019) will give you a lot of 

self-sustainability.  The reviver hive can also pick you up if you go down even when you're playing solo. 

Beyond that, you can pick skills mainly based on personal preference.

[Discussion] 10k eggs becoming more of a chore than a rewarding experience,"I have hatched fifteen 10 kilometer eggs this week, and received 6 mareep, 5 trapinch, 3 drifloon (like come on, a Drifloon in a 10k?) and a dratini, all of which were non shiny, and less than 90% for the IV rating. It’s almost to the point where I’m only going for 7 km eggs for the shiny babies, and even that doesn’t feel worth the effort due to the ABYSMAL rate, for both Shinies and High (90%+) IV ratings. I’m transferring everything I hatch from an egg immediately at this point unless it’s a shiny, or better than the last Mareep I hatched. Its evident that super and regular Egg Incubators are Niantics’ biggest cash grab, so it seems that they would at least incentivize the incubators more with a better yield from the highest tier of egg. I’ve seen dozens of threads on this in the last YEAR of this game, and it’s a little mind boggling that we haven’t gotten an update or explanation as to why it has not or will not happen. I believe that 2K and 5K are as rewarding as they should be, helping you get some of the rarer spawns, or even more starter candy for future CD events, or even just getting that good IV Croagunk or what have you.  Hatching eggs is the endgame part of the game, and Niantic makes a lot of money off of this, but if we are  being disappointed 9/10 times We hatch the “best” egg in the game, We’re much less incentivized to spend any money or time on this aspect. Hoping for even a minor tweak to the rates for 10k, or even the removal of CD Pokémon once their day has passed and put into 7k eggs. I never want to see a Mareep or Trapinch again

Avenger’s Endgame: Event Idea,"I know that this is wont happen but I want to theorycraft what was an awesome opportunity to do an engaging and original event for the most anticipated Marvel movie to date. 

The idea hinges that all characters get a new flair, *either* Decimated or Spared. Characters that were shown (or later revealed) to be dusted like Spider-Man, Black Panther, Starlord etc. other characters like Hulk, Iron Man, Nebula get the Spared. 

For characters we don’t know (defenders, minions, mutants etc) just randomly apply them so teams synergy is broken up. This way it will make team composition more unique and challenging. 

Now for the fun part, two new campaigns would be released (at the same time using the same energy), one only spared characters can participate and the other for decimated characters. The decimated characters story would be about freeing the spared, could visit locations like Wakanda, Titan, New York,Space (to rescue Tony Stark). Spared characters would be to discovery the mysteries of the soul stone, maybe visit the quantum realm with wasp. 

To bring a community feel, a *global* milestone would be added that everyone in the world contributes to. Regardless of your individual or alliance contribution, all Marvel fans are united as one in a common cause, to undo the damage of Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet. 


I’m sure we will get a lacklustre single player campaign, probably with the Avenger tag, but this game has such great intellectual property and an opportunity to really create something amazing and memorable.

[DOM] March 8-14 Domestic Box Office Week Recap,"**Comps**

- *Captain Marvel* is a smash hit, and the strong weekdays backed up the historic opening weekend. The opening week of $196.9m was 86% of *Beauty and the Beast* (OW was 88%), 104% of *The Hunger Games* (OW was 101%), 108% of *Guardians of the Galaxy 2* (OW was 105%), and 167% of *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (OW was 161%). Props to /u/Sliver__Legion for the assist in selecting these comps. Our first-look projected range is surprisingly narrow at $419m-$434m, which I’m going to drop a bit to say **$415m-$434m**. It’ll be interesting to see the impact of the new *Endgame* trailer and whether it results in a stronger than expected 2nd weekend hold. The Thursday jump of 8% was an early sign of the trailer’s impact, and the film will fly past $200m today.

- *How to Train Your Dragon 3* improved somewhat on the comps after some holiday disconnects. The $21.3m (-43%) was 71% of *How to Train Your Dragon* (down from 82%), 95% of *How to Train Your Dragon 2* (down from 96%), 110% of *SpongeBob 2* (up from 80%), and 93% of *Lego Batman* (up from 75%). This has translated into a notably improved projected range, which now sits at $156m-$194m. I’m going to once again remove the top comp from our projection (*HTTYD*), which makes the range **$156m-$167m**. Floor is bumped from last week while the ceiling remains the same, and I’m comfortable with that. Fun note – the 43% drop this week was the same from week 1 to week 2. I like number coincidences.

- *A Madea Family Funeral* had a big drop of 49%, but still had a solid gross of $17.2m. This was 115% of *Madea Family Reunion* (up from 96%), 79% of *Madea Boo! Halloween* (down from 96%, but this was the Halloween bump), 144% of *Madea Big Happy Family* (up from 109%), and 119% of *Madea Witness Protection* (up from 95%). The projected range currently sits at $63m-$67m, which I think is slightly too low. Let’s say **$63m-$70m**. There’s obviously no competition for its target audience.

- *The Lego Movie 2* had another good week, yet again dropping only 28%. The $5.9m was 39% of *The Lego Movie* (up from 32%), 51% of *Lego Batman* (down from 58%), and 218% of *Lego Ninjago* (up from 158%). The range has improved slightly and is now **$107m-$112m**. As with *How to Train Your Dragon 3*, the floor has increased while the ceiling has remained. This performance, aided by many schools on Spring Break, has earned the film one more week of comps, so we’ll still report on it next time.

- *Alita: Battle Angel* had a rough time with the introduction of *Captain Marvel*, dropping 52% for $4.8m. This was 42% of *Kingsman* (down from 63%), 56% of *Glass* (down from 77%), 156% of *Die Hard 5* (down from 162%), and 99% of *Jumper* (down from 104%). The unadjusted projected range is now $84m-$101m, and if we take out *Kingsman*, as always, the range becomes **$84m-$87m**. The film is also losing another 29% of its screens, and given the minimal potential left, this will be my last time running comps on the film.

**The weekly ramble**

- Oscar Boost: The Oscar boost is over as the critical darlings (well, some of them are anyway) flamed out. *A Star is Born*, *Spider-Verse*, *Bohemian Rhapsody* (…..), and *The Favourite* all dropped between 57%-67%. *Green Book* stayed relevant with a 43% drop, making $3.7m. The film is losing 38% of its screens and is now out on Blu-Ray, put it did pass $80m domestically. Well done, Universal.

- Paul Thomas Anderson: *Captain Marvel* was the unsurprising victor this week, with a $45,684 per-theater average. *Gloria Bell*, the new Julianne Moore led film, was also strong with a $37,911 PTA from 5 theaters. On the sadder side of things, *Happy Death Day 2U* struggled with a PTA of $1,141, even after losing 53% of its screens last week. Now it’s being punished with another 56% theater count drop.

- Other: Something called *CatVideoFest* jumped 557% from last week and made $232,131. Strange. A moment of silence for the Annapurna Bombs: *If Beale Street Could Talk* (my favorite film of 2018), *Vice*, and *Destroyer*. Apparently these films combined to lose at least $30m. *Isn’t it Romantic* crossed $45m, but with a surprisingly high budget of $31m, this unfortunately isn’t a success.

**Bit of an uneventful box office week outside of *Captain Marvel*. Enjoy the weekend everyone! Next time we’ll get to add another film to the bomb squad... You get 3 guesses…**",boxoffice,76,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/b1l8qg/dom_march_814_domestic_box_office_week_recap/,,Tomahawkeye12,b1l8qg,/r/boxoffice/comments/b1l8qg/dom_march_814_domestic_box_office_week_recap/,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/b1l8qg/dom_march_814_domestic_box_office_week_recap/,34,2019-03-15

5.  Conclusion

6.  **tl;dr**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Introduction**  
In the following paragraphs I will present my theory on what I think will be a major point in the upcoming chapters and the ending of the manga. That said, I will not predict certain details since how those aspects are executed is not important for this theory and there are many different possibilities for this to play out. Also, it might be impossible for us to predict how Isayama will handle those details, we are talking about Attack on Titan after all.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Ymir Fritz - The Cursed Girl**   
Now that we have seen the girl in Zeke's PATHS dream (who is most likely Ymir Fritz) I am certain that we will see at least one chapter on Ymir's backstory and how this whole titan debacle started. In Section 3.1 I will talk about how we will probably see this by exposition through Eren.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.1. Ymir's Backstory**   
We will see a young Ymir, approximately 11 years old, as she appeared when she rebuild Zeke's body. She lived with a few hundred or maybe thousand people in some sparsely populated region of the world. People suffered at the time, water may have been sparse, crops did not yield much, and so on. Since there is a desert in the PATHS dimension, this might be the biome they actually lived in. 

One day, when she was away from her village (maybe to get water, hence the bucket we saw her with), she met someone or found something which resulted in her coming in contact with the ""source of all organic matter"". I will not predict how exactly this works or what exactly happened but for the sake of simplicity I will always refer to this ""someone"" as ""Devil"" and this something as ""Coordinate"" and ""Power of the Titans"" for the remainder of this text. The important point is that she accepted the power of the titans willingly because she wanted to end the suffering of her people (which we now know as the ""Subjects Of Ymir"" and ""Eldians"") but she did not foresee the consequences and implications of her ""deal with the devil"".   
In other words, I think Ymir was a very kind person who was tricked into accepting this power. In the beginning she did what the Eldian restorationists believed she did; she cultivated the lands, built roads and bridges, etc.. She saved her people.

But there must also be some truth to Marley's version of history, which started a few years after Ymir accepted the Coordinate.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.2 Ymir's Curse**   
I believe the Coordinate is like a parasite or a disease, and the Eldians are the host. Therefore I will call this parasite/disease ""Coordinate"" from here on out. Parasites do not really have a free will or anything, they just want to ""exist"" or maybe even ""spread"". After Ymir accepted the Coordinate it mutated and adapted to Ymir's DNA. Hence only Royal blood, which is Ymir's blood, can harness the full power of the Coordinate. Ymir was also of Eldian descent, which is why Eldians are subject to the power of the titans and are linked to the Coordinate via PATHS.

Here is my reasoning for saying that the Coordinate just ""wants"" to exist.   
Firstly, we learned from Xaver that 200 years ago a holder of the founding titan altered the bodies of Eldians to make them immune to a plague. This plague would have killed the Eldians, i.e. the host of the Coordinate, and thus the Coordinate itself. 

Secondly, King Fritz's vow renouncing all war is just a way of not changing anything. As long as Eldians just live on the island, protected by the walls, there are always more subjects of Ymir and the Coordinate can thrive. The Coordinate is no intelligent being, so it could not foresee other humans surpassing the power of the titans with machinery. But as long as Titans attack the walls, it means there are still subjects of Ymir in the world, which is sufficient for the Coordinate's continued existence. 

Lastly, the Ackerman Clan was produced by titan science, i.e. one holder of the founding titan messing with Eldian DNA, as a way to protect the king. Again, this is just further means to protect the Coordinate and Eldians in general. I would also argue, that during these 2000 years the Coordinate mutated enough so that nobody is truly immune anymore. There are people like Reiner, who are half Eldian and half Marleyan, and it does not seem to affect Reiners Shifter abilities. And by the Eldians spreading their DNA during their reign before the Great Titan War, the Coordinate was already introduced to DNA from probably any ethnicity possible, so killing all Edians or neutering them might not solve the problem at all, it might just force the Coordinate to fully adapt to a new host.

Now, back to Ymir. 

A few years after Ymir infected herself with the Coordinate she started to change due to the mutating parasite in her. She felt a urge to spread Eldian DNA, which was the Coordinate ""yearning"" for more hosts. Ymir herself did not want this, so she fought this urge but her own will grew weaker and weaker while the Coordinate started to take control of her. 

In nature parasites often result in the death of their host, this is the same for the coordinate, hence Ymir's will became weaker with her body slowly dying. Maybe she was not even able to kill herself due to the Coordinate's influence and in the end, she even had her daughters and six other people consume her which split her powers in nine parts (see Section 3.2.1 - 3.2.5). Please note that there are a lot of possibilities of what exactly happened, again, I choose this variant for simplicity. Maybe she died and PATHS passed the power on or maybe she tried to kill herself by titans eating her as the only way possible, which just passed the power unbeknown to her. 

Now with the Coordinate separated from Ymir struggling against it, it unleashed its full potential and the many years of Titans killing other ethnicities, Eldians forcing women to to bear their children and all the other things Marley propagated truly began. But Ymir's will lived on in the Attack Titan, so conflict (the great titan war) was imminent and history as we learned about it unfolded.

&amp;#x200B;

**2.3 Ymir's Suffering**   
Ymir's body died but Ymir's ""lived"" on in the PATHS dimension we saw. In fact, the moment she accepted the Coordinate her true self, eleven years old at the time, became prisoner in this surreal place. 

I strongly believe we will learn that Ymir's suffering surpasses everything we have seen in this story, which unfortunately is quite the achievement. She saw from the PATHS dimension everything that happened for nearly 2000 years. She saw it from the point of view of every single Eldian that ever lived, exactly like for example Eren sees memories of Grisha, Kruger, Frieda, .... She saw how Titans terrorized the world, how Eldians abused the power, then how Eldians where used like cheap weapons of mass destruction. Every extinguished hope, every crushed dream, every destroyed family, she saw everything... and she blamed herself for everything, after all it was her who started it all. Her intentions were good, but the outcome was the worst humanity ever saw.   
Not only did she see everything, she felt it, too. In chapter 115 we learned that Eren actually felt how his father crushed the Reiss children, so we now know that PATHS can even transport physical sensation. 

She rebuilds the bodies of titan shifters out of guilt. Her demeanour when she saved Zeke could very well be interpreted as her feeling sorry for Zeke, who had to suffer his whole life, like all the other titan shifters. But I do not think she has an agenda, she did not evaluate Zeke's plan, she just ""exists"" in this path dimension and does what is in her power to ease the physical suffering of Eldians that were unfortunate enough to become Shifters. Maybe she does not even have a choice in her role as repair girl for Shifter bodies. Her will to break free and to end what she started is inside the Attack Titan (Section 3), so the girl Ymir who was lost in the PATHS dimension is just a suffering shell of herself.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Eren Yaeger - Fighting For Ymir's Freedom**   
This is where Eren comes in, the person holding both Ymir's will of fighting for freedom, and the very thing that started it all, the Coordinate. Until he learned about Ymir's fate he might have been planing to go along with Zeke's plan, but I think that changed when he learned what happened to her.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.1. How Eren Learned About Ymir's Fate**   
When Eren ate the Warhammer Titan he saw a light. Since PATH related incidents feel like they last forever but are over in an instant, this might have been the point when he actually saw Ymir's story. He probably understood then and there that the freedom the Attack Titan was always fighting for is the Freedom of Ymir who is a prisoner of PATHS. He also learned about the true nature of the Coordinate, hence finding a way to destroy the Coordinate should on the one hand collapse the whole PATHS network (because everything is connected to and by the Coordinate) and on the other hand free Ymir from her curse. Vice versa it might also be true that freeing Ymir is the key to the destruction of the Coordinate.  
Again, those are details that are up for debate. Maybe destroying the Coordinate is just making sure that Ymir never accepts it in the first place.  


&amp;#x200B;

**3.2. Eren's Goal, And How The Nine Titans Play Into This**   
Even though, again, I will not predict how exactly this will be achieved, I will now present a few details that will play a part in it in my opinion. I do not think that Eren will need all the parts of Ymir's Titan but a few of them are necessary; the titans that do not just carry physical traits of her Titan Power, but aspects of her will.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**3.2.1. The Attack Titan - Ymir's Will To Break Free**   
We know that the Attack Titan has always sought for freedom. As stated before this freedom is most likely the freedom of Ymir, and by extension the freedom of the Eldian people. Destroying the Coordinate will most likely free both Ymir and end the era of the titans once and for all. An interesting fact is that even though the Attack Titan resembles the devil from e.g. Historias book the most it is actually the titan that carries Ymir's will and opposes the Devil/Coordinate.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.2.2. The Founding Titan - The Will To Protect The Curse**   
Even though the Attack Titan resembles the devil, the Founding Titan is the titan that actually tries everything to protect the Coordinate (itself). Its full potential is only realized by a holder of royal blood since the first contact was with Ymir (see above) so unlike Ymir Eren is not strongly affected by its will to guarantee the survival of its host, the Eldians. So from the very beginning Eren had the same clashing ideologies in him that Ymir already had to deal with, but because Eren is not of royal descent this time Ymir's will fighting for freedom is winning and the coordinate is suppressed.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.2.3. The Female Titan - Ymir's Body And The Will To Destroy Itself**   
Annie will be important because her titan probably is a key to the story. 

One special ability of the Female Titan is the call for mindless titans. But it does not just call for them, it actually forces them to devour the female titan.   
One might argue that titans always prioritize Titan shifters over humans, but when Eren was carrying the boulder in Trost to block the hole the titans also attacked and killed the soldiers defending Eren, while the titans Annie summoned in the forest of giant trees completely ignored the scouts trying to protect the female titan. 

As I theorized in Section 2 Ymir might have wanted to kill herself to stop the increasing influence of the Coordinate on her. But since it was too strong already, she was not able to do it. This 'suicidal' tendency of Ymir might have been split into the Female Titan, plus the Female Titan inherited the femininity of Ymir. 

Even though I do not like the prospect, I think if Eren needs to eat another Titan Shifter it probably is Annie, because then Ymir will be complete again and Eren might be able to change something, maybe aid Ymir via PATHS against the influence of the Coordinate or stop her from doing the deal. We know that PATHS work in both directions, in the past or in the future, so in other words: With all of Ymir's traits Eren might be able to reach and influence her in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.2.4. The Warhammer Titan - Connection To The Earth**   
Eren might have unlocked Ymir's memories  because he ate one third of the titans that once were Ymir, or the WHT actually has some significance. I guess the WHT is actually on the 'side' of the Coordinate, since I think it symbolizes the connection to the Earth. Those crystalline structures of the hardening ability might come from the earth or maybe PATHS sand can be used to form the crystals. But since it does not carry the will of the Coordinate, just the powers, the possession of the WHT is probably a good thing and does not tip the struggle inside Eren in favour of the Coordinate.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.2.5. Jaw, Armor, Colossal, Beast, Cart - Physical Traits**   
These Titans are probably not important since they only carry physical traits of Ymir's Titan, the only one I am not certain about is the Beast Titan. 

The Jaw Titan inherited agility and the claws and teeth, the Armored Titan inherited the strength and, well, armor, the Colossal Titan the size, and the Cart Titan the endurance and mobility. 

This will also leave Armin alive so he might remain the narrator until the very end. Furthermore it fits the narrative that Reiner is denied death again, because the Armored Titan does not need to be consumed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**4. How This Theory Affects Certain Unanswered Questions - Prediction**   
Just a few things I wanted to talk about in this context.

&amp;#x200B;

**4.1. Zeke's Role**   
Zeke's Titan with royal blood will probably still be important to kickstart the final PATHS action of Eren. Again, the details are up for debate.

&amp;#x200B;

**4.2. The Role Of The Warriors**   
In chapter 115 Eren wanted Gabi to send a message to the ""infiltrators"". He probably is aware that the Warriors are on Paradis. Since he will need the Female Titan to take action he might want to share his final plan with them and ask for Porcos help to get to Annie out of her Crystal. This would be far easier than to hunt Porco down to obtain the Jaw Titan. He already was aware of that in Marley, so Reiner saving Porco from being eaten was merely a minor inconvenience.

&amp;#x200B;

**4.3. Historia's Role**   
When we saw Ymir in the PATHS dream of Zeke she looked very similar to a young Historia on her grandparents farm. Historia is a descendant and DNA has some randomness to it, so I think Historia's DNA is actually very similar to Ymir's by chance. 

This would make all the ""Are you a goddess?"" comments about her great foreshadowing from the very beginning. She indeed closely resembles the goddess Ymir Fritz (and was also really close to the fake goddess Ymir who ate Marcel). 

&amp;#x200B;

**4.4. ""To You, 2000 Years From Now""**   
There are a lot of possibilities, I will just add one in this context. We can assume that in the Dream Eren had he saw the future (He mentions Mikasa's long hair and in the anime he also sees the immediate future of the Fall of Shiganshina.). Since young Eren is on a timeline and probably on a PATH directly between future (i.e. current) Eren and Ymir, he probably saw everything what will happen between Ymir and himself from the future. In other words he accidentally intercepted the connection between himself and Ymir, since he is between them.

**4.5 Eren's Behaviour Towards Mikasa**   
As stated above the Ackerman Clan is a mean of the Coordinate to protect itself. Since the Coordinate is something like the main antagonist of the story and the very thing the Attack Titan seeks to destroy, Eren's opinion of any Ackerman must have been negatively affected by the knowledge he now has. 

But he did not always hate Mikasa, he just states a logical conclusion in any context. If he always hated people that are content with being slaves and if Mikasa always was a slave without even knowing it, then Mikasa was one of the people Eren always hated. He actually wants to get away from her because her Ackerman instincts might very well stop Eren from destroying the Coordinate.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Conclusion**  
Freeing Ymir from her curse is the key to freeing the Eldians and the world of the titans. Since just 'deactivating' the PATHS will not save the Eldians from racism and persecution from other ethnicities I also assume that it will actually be about changing history so titans never existed OR showing the world that everyone is connected to the Coordinate, maybe even using the Coordinate itself to wipe the memory about the titans from everyone's mind.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. tl;dr**  
Eren saw how Ymir obtained the Power of the Titans when he ate the WHT. Ymir accepted the Power of the Titans to save her people, but it startet to take control of her and after she died and her powers were split the age of Terror by the Titans began. Ymir herself remains trapped in the PATH dimension where she saved Zeke. Freeing her and destroying the Coordinate are connected. The Attack Titan is fighting for the freedom of Ymir.   
Eren is just missing the Female Titan to collect all parts of Ymir so he can connect to her via PATHS. Then he may stop her from doing the deal with the devil or destroy the Coordinate or... or...

"(Spoilers) I am updating my theory for the endgame of Season 2, as after Daedalus I am even more confident","TLDR: Michael is going to create a rival super AI using the sphere's 100% knowledge as opposed to the 25% Control has now. Knowing how long it'll take for the Discovery to evolve into that AI, the crew will park it and tell it to stay put. They'll then begin the battle against our machine overlords. 1000 years later... The discovery will rescue a human named Craft and falls in love. Completing it's evolution, Zora will decide to save sentient life to provide a better life for Craft and her crew and will battle Control in a game of high stakes 4D chess across time and space.

&amp;#x200B;

So I mentioned after episode 8 that I believed 3 common tropes of this season seemed to be indicating a certain roadmap to the end of its central mystery:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Control, the AI which directs the actions of Section 31 had been name dropped several times in several episodes
2. Chess had been shown and referenced across several episodes and even a Short Trek
3. The Short Treks (with the exception of the Mudd one) seemed relevant to the new season... The first showed Tilly's ability to empathize with strange creatures providing a foundation to her eventual empathy with May, the Saru episode gave a deeper look into his species which became important in season 2, Mudd may show up again or may be nothing, and Calypso set up a big mystery which it did not solve, leading me to believe it would be solved in season 2.

Based on these, I surmised that the ultimate endgame for this season is a high stakes game of 4D chess between two rival AI systems. One bent on the destruction of sentient life, assuming superiority to flawed organics and the other becoming sentient itself and finding perfection in the flaws. I believe the Red Angel is Zora from Calypso responding to Control's subterfuge and subjugation of the galaxy from the future.

&amp;#x200B;

So how could we get here?

&amp;#x200B;

In last night's episode we got confirmation that the antagonist is most certainly Control gone rogue. Considering the implications of the probe sent into the temporal anomaly from episode 8 returning 500 years from the future with new and angry tech I think it's safe to assume that, currently in the Star Trek timeline, Control ends up winning. I believe this is further backed up by the Calypso short, when a human is subjugated by some unknown race and Discovery is lost at space. One could assume it's just far beyond our stars but it could also be that the federation no longer exists and has been replaced by Control's robotic army or whatever and has enslaved humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

In last night's episode we see yet ANOTHER explicit use of chess as a concept, and in fact that becomes a way of getting past Control's defenses... playing a ""game"" and introducing random elements to stop it from guessing the next move. Control has intimate knowledge of all Federation strategic data from priority star systems, defensive and weapon tech, and combat maneuvers... It can literally guess at what comes next or react accordingly. Humanity (blanket term I am using for sentient life) is doomed to fail because collectively the federation cannot out think the computer it programmed to out think everything.

&amp;#x200B;

So Disco crew is going to find the original designer or plans for the Control program and realize the only thing that may be able to beat Control is a system who's thoughts and strategies can think on a similar level to Control and which Control has no basis of reference for to counter... A rival AI created to evolve into it's own sentience with an emphasis on the GOOD parts of humanity. Control was designed to fight Starfleet's enemies and is probably paranoid. Using the Sphere's knowledge, the Disco crew will begin to teach the Discovery's computer how to be that AI. Control is obviously interested in that knowledge so it has to be the key to unlock true sentience. When they complete their mission, they'll need to let the computer evolve itself so that they don't accidentally program any weaknesses into it and so it can't be exploited by any tech failings. They'll park Discovery somewhere hidden and begin the battle against Control, ultimately failing in their quest. Over 1000 years, Discovery's computer evolves, learns, comes close to sentience. And then she rescues a human named Craft and falls in love. That emotional connection, love which overcomes the loneliness and the grief that comes from LOSING that love is the final piece which allows Zora to overcome her programming, defy her orders, and fight Control to save those she loves and lost. Essentially, she'd become computer Spock or Michael, all the benefits of being able to see logic but with the added strength of understanding what's at stake and being able to make moves Control can't understand.

&amp;#x200B;

It explains why the Red Angel is so focused on the crew of Discovery. Why it fights to keep Michael alive (in fact the numerous times she's almost died could be Control trying to kill her early), why it seems interested in helping Saru's people evolve, etc. The outlier being the colony of New Eden but I have two theories on that. One is that she wanted to send a colony of humans far from Control so they'd survive if she failed. But my favorite is that she determined who Craft's ancestors were and sent them far away so he could be born into a life of peace and happiness instead of the hell he currently resides in.

For Honor is impressively infuriating,"For Honor is an impressive game. It's got a solid core fighting system that mixes Mount and Blade with traditional arcade fighters and gives it fantastic animations. It's clear those parts were crafted with care.

I need a list for the parts that weren't.

* Uniquely unsatisfying ""progression"" system based on Ubisoft's quadruple-dipping live ""service"" business model first, investors second, and players ninth.
* Perk system is somehow worse than the P2W gearing system before it. Gear drops are so unsatisfying that the ""earnings"" after a match make me not want to play another. How hard would it be to add reward currency with which you can buy the gear you want? That is, if Ubi can possibly make us *want* any of the terrible gear that drops.
* Quadruple-dipping business model makes it extremely clear who Ubisoft really made this game for. Pay up front for the game. Pay a subscription for more loot and XP. Pay for steel to buy effects or new heroes. Pay for season passes. Pay for expansions. Quintuple-dipping if you count the expansions and season passes separately.
* Uniquely intrusive and unintuitive menu UI, with unskippable elements no one cares about taking up the center of the screen, or completely redundant alerts covering up the chat box.
* Slow, unintuitive UI takes ages to get to any part of the game you want to interact with. It takes five minutes to find a match, then another two or three for everyone to select their characters, load in, and for the unnecessary cutscene to play. I can be fighting an endgame boss in OSRS within twenty seconds of clicking the icon on my desktop, and that's a 20-year-old MMO with a 20-year-old UI.
* The menu UI treats the faction war like it's the most important and engaging part of the game. Removing it would make the game objectively better.
* How hard do I have to mash space before the game realizes I don't care about the useless faction war and lets me queue for a match?
* It's worth another bullet point to stress just how much I hate the menus. It's impressive how bad they are. No other game has made me hate its menus this much. No other game has ever made me alt-f4 in the menus unless said menus were bugged. A UI like this from any other company would have been cause to delay the game until it was completely reworked and repaired. In a few years, we'll see For's UI used in textbooks for game dev students as an example of a worst-case scenario.
* Impressively unengaging single-player ""experience."" Nobody and nothing to care about. Nothing to fight for. No cultures to get invested in. The background NPCs in most games have more character than For's protagonists.
* Single-player mechanics are completely isolated from multiplayer, meaning it can't be used as a more varied training mode than bots. It's just a joyless slog with a few cosmetics locked behind it.
* Always-online requirement for both single-player and training modes. Makes perfect sense, keeping in mind that players are at the bottom of Ubi's list of people to please.
* Core combat system clearly designed around 1v1s. Rest of the game designed around 4v4.
* Removal of minion killing animations makes killing minions feel terrible on many characters. When met with heavy backlash, Ubisoft doubled down on this change. Likely they messed up the Breach minion code and couldn't figure out how to fix it without rewriting half of the game.
* I hate Breach.
* Marching Fire added a faction full of heroes infuriating in both design and moveset. Zero charm between the four of them. If they never add another Wu Lin, it'll be four too many. I can only take so much high-pitched screeching.
* China doesn't lack enjoyable heroes or archetypes. The Wu Lin are an insult to the Chinese, despite clearly being designed for them. If they insist on making the characters unlikable and unhinged, a level 4 feat to spawn a siege engine and run over a square full of friendly minions would have at least been good for a laugh.
* Half the male minions have female voices.
* Minions can interrupt executions and revives. Another unwelcome ""update"" from Marching Fire.
* Given that Ubi managed to completely isolate the single-player and multiplayer mechanics, I'm actually impressed that they managed to ruin other modes to suit Breach. Impressed and disappointed, but not surprised.
* Giving faces to more characters is a welcome change, but how do you make a Chinese swordswoman unattractive? *How?*
* I'm not qualified to talk about balance because I suck, but this is r/ForHonorRants, not the other place.
* Centurion's cutscene is infuriating.
* Perks that counter entire heroes' kits are infuriating. Centurion needs wallsplats? Rocksteady. Nobushi, PK, and shaman need their bleeds? Would be a shame if anyone were to completely nullify that with no counterplay.
* ""We want to be careful with large changes, so we'll just adjust PK's pool-noodle damage so it tickles a little more."" 
* I seem to be uniquely bad at dodging bashes and unblockables. This isn't Ubi's fault, but it's still infuriating.
* Shinobi is uniquely hateable. I consider him an honorary Wu Lin.
* I like Law. Ubi doesn't.
* That the Wu Lin were released before Law got a rework is an insult to the Law.
* Instant healing feats were a terrible idea. Whoever came up with them should have their pay cut.
* Combat-altering feats in general have no reason to exist. Whoever came up with them should have their pay cut again, because it has to be the same pigeon.
* Stop employing pigeons.
* Revenge in 1v1s was a terrible idea. Fix incoming several years too late.
* I have a terrible time fighting Shugoki. He doesn't feel bad to fight against (especially compared to Cent), but he does make me feel stupid every time I lose. Which is most of the time.
* Valk being able to trip her own teammates doesn't make me angry with my teammates, it makes me angry with the developers. It's not the players' fault Ubi hired pigeons.
* This game makes me uniquely salty. Of course other games feel tedious or frustrating, or can be so unenjoyable that I uninstall and never play again (MOBAs). For is in a unique position wherein the very core of the game is fun enough that I want to keep playing, but nearly everything aside from the core elements is so impressively infuriating that I could never recommend the game in good faith, to anyone.

[MANGA SPOILERS] Endgame Theory on Titan Power,"A while back Eren Kruger brought [this](https://imgur.com/dsDXrEz) up. 


""When she was a girl... our ancestor Ymir touched the source of all living matter.""


It's more likely than you think. I'm not sure If Isayama will ever go where I'm going with this, but I want it out of my system.


After all, it's made apparent that Titan materials come from *somewhere*, right? They're suggested to be sent along invisible ""Paths"" that connect every Eldian. Kruger said those paths cross at the Coordinate/Founding Titan, but that still wouldn't explain the actual source - after all, the Founding Titan's gotta get its stuff from somewhere too. So the ""source of all living matter"" (hencefoth referred to as SOALM) would rather conveniently explain where Titan flesh and blood originates. At least it's more sensible than that Devil story. The Devil shows up just once out of nowhere to a little girl and makes a deal with her and only her? Give me a break. **TL;DR: TITAN STUFF COMES FROM THE SOALM**


But this is the SOALM we're talking about. If that's what it really is, all living matter came from it. In other words, the SOALM is the origin of life on the Earth of SnK. I'm not suggesting that it poofed all life into existence. Every living thing in the world of SnK is just like those in ours. Life in our world evolved gradually over millions of years, so it's safe to assume the same occurred in Snk (we all saw the dinosaurs in the S2 OP). Just with the notable difference of the first living thing originating from the SOALM.  **TL;DR UNIVERSAL COMMON ANCESTOR CAME FROM SOALM**


So life in SnK evolved exactly the same as on our rightside-up earth. They even get humans too. One of them is named Ymir and she touches the SOALM and gets Titan cancer. Where did she find it? I doubt just lying in the middle of nowhere. It'd have to be hidden away somewhere. The best explanation is in a cave or something. I could see a little girl wandering into a cave and finding something no one's found before. And I'm betting this place is beneath Paradis. **TL;DR: THE SOALM LIES BENEATH PARADIS**


It sorta makes sense. Why else would King Fritz build his paradise there, where it all began? [Plus there's that story Zeke mentioned about Eldians being there ""since antiquity"", digging up neat minerals found nowhere else.](https://imgur.com/8zEVAiN) Let's talk about that. Zeke said those materials were ""born from the power of the Titans"". But if we interpret that as ""Titans created Iceburst Stone"", we run into problems. We've never seen Titans create Iceburst Stone (or anything inorganic) and if they could, they shouldn't have to dig for it. I think the main takeaway from this old story is that Paradis' underground resources have something to do with the Titans and by extension the SOALM. **TL;DR: PARADIS' RESOURCES ARE RELATED TO THE SOALM**


Despite their connection, I don't think the source of all *living matter* would produce inorganic matter though. So what if the SOALM and the ores came from the same place? And by ""place"" I mean ""space"". Think about it - something as metaphysically powerful as the SOALM probably didn't just happen on an Earth subject to the same natural processes as ours. So maybe it came from someplace not Earth. And those rare minerals? Check out this [list of meteoric minerals on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_meteorite_minerals) and click on a few - you'll see they often aren't found on Earth at all otherwise. If Zeke says Iceburst Stone (miraculously useful unlike anything in real life btw) is only found on Paradis (to the point where the resource-hungry Azumbitos aren't aware it exists) there's no reason to believe Titans create inorganic matter, it's safe to assume it's a meteoric mineral that didn't form naturally on Earth. And because it landed on what would become Paradis, it's only found there. **TL;DR: SOALM AND ITS ASSOCIATED RESOURCES CAME FROM SPACE**


So there you have it - The SOALM came from space, life came from the SOALM and Ymir got her powers from the SOALM. In a way, it kinda makes sense to me that if Ymir touched a weird metaphysical thing from space that also happened to be her progenitor, weird metaphysical things would happen. But what is the SOALM? Is it some sort of entity? I think it might be a lot like Neon Genesis Evangelion in that [Big Eva Spoilers](#s ""aliens dispersed metaphysical ""seeds of life"", one of which landed on earth and originated all life there). It certainly wouldn't be the only discernible influence from Eva on the story of SnK - just off the top of my head, we've got a boy forced by his father to save the world, flesh mechs controlled by a pilot residing the nape of the neck, and a main character who just can't seem to get anywhere with girls.

Hulk in the Infinity War trailer,"Okay, there's not really any evidence for this, but reading through some of the theories on here got me thinking.

It's been mentioned the Endgame trailer scene with Tony and Nebula could be fake like when the Hulk appeared in the IW trailer. 

BUT... What if the Hulk scene wasn't fake? Many of the theories here suggest preventing the Snap through time travel. 

I can't find a link, but I'm sure I read last year that the Russo brothers said something along the lines of ""we've taken a bit of a different approach to the trailer that hasn't happened before"" or something to that effect.

My theory is that some scenes from the IW trailer were actually scenes from Endgame. The Hulk actually does join the fight in Wakanda, but only after Bruce joins the Avengers when they go back in time to try and stop Thanos. 

Apologies if this has been theorised before, but I haven't come across it yet.

[International] Captain Marvel vs the MCU - an analysis,"At this stage in *Black Panther*'s run, I [made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/80yl4r/international_where_is_black_panther/) comparing its opening weekends to those of other MCU films. Now that *Captain Marvel* is having a similarly off-the-scale time, I thought I'd run a comparison between those two films.

When I took the data on BP's opening weekends from *Mojo*, it listed 46 overseas territories it had opened in. It has since opened in China, Russia, and Japan, to make 49 territories. I didn't check if any others had been listed.

*Captain Marvel* has opened in 46 territories. Of these, two are territories where *Black Panther* wasn't listed by Mojo - Croatia and Vietnam. That leaves five territories where Mojo had figures for *Black Panther* by not *Captain Marvel* - Bolivia, Greece, Japan, Paraguay, and Uruguay. 

Across the 44 territories where both films have listed opening weekends on Mojo, 11 territories had higher openings for *Black Panther* and 33 had higher openings for *Captain Marvel*.

Those 11 territories and the absolute gap between them:
- Bulgaria ($11,000)  
- Denmark ($60,000)  
- Iceland ($26,000)  
- Netherlands ($80,000)  
- New Zealand ($20,000) 
- Norway ($80,000) 
- Portugal ($1,100)  
- South Africa ($680,000)  
- South Korea ($7,000,000)  
- Sweden ($180,000)  
- UK ($8,500,000)  

If you were watching *Black Panther*'s box office performance then you'll recall that it did extremely well in South Korea and the UK, and those numbers are reflected here. South Africa also shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, although worth noting that *Ragnarok* did much better there than either film.

Those three countries aside, the films where *Black Panther* did ""better"" than *Captain Marvel* seem to basically be countries where they did pretty much the same. Generally speaking, these are northern European countries where February releases in the dark are likely to do better than March releases in the usually-not-quite-as-dark. Even the Netherlands, which liked *Black Panther* as much as it liked the first two Avengers films, likes *Captain Marvel* as much as it likes *Black Panther*.

## Other MCU films

I could find 43 countries where all five of *Captain Marvel*, *Black Panther*, and the three 2017 MCU films opened (I had to exclude Russia for legacy reasons). Of these, *Captain Marvel* was the highest grossing in a massive **23** of them. *Ragnarok* was in eight, *Black Panther* in six, and *Homecoming* and *GOTG2* in three each.

With a few key exceptions (China, South Korea, and the UK, as well as a few small countries where *Ragnarok* did really freakishly well), *Captain Marvel* was usually close behind the winner in key markets. It wasn't last in a single territory, unlike all the other films. And when it won, it often absolutely walloped the competition. In countries like Thailand, Italy, Taiwan, France, Spain, Singapore, Philippines, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Colombia, Chile, and arguably even Mexico, it's doing numbers that are completely unprecedented for a solo MCU film. Except maybe *Iron Man 3*.

Beyond the obvious, I would point out that Mojo doesn't have numbers from many South American countries on *Captain Marvel*. If Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela (ahem) all posted similarly strong numbers to Colombia and Chile, then this could add around $9m to the opening weekend figures. Not much in the context of $400m or whatever, but actually quite a lot of money!

## Never mind that! What about *The Avengers* and *Age of Ultron*?

As with *Black Panther*, *Captain Marvel* outperformed the first two *Avengers* films in emerging markets in much of Eastern Europe and SE Asia. It succeeded in more places than *Black Panther*, including Belgium, Brazil, Poland, Czechia, Finland, Hungary, Malaysia, and Slovakia, pointing to a serious long-term increase in the popularity of the MCU in those countries. As well as Belgium, it's notable that *Captain Marvel* outperformed both *Avengers* films in the Netherlands, repeating what might have seemed like a fluke from *Black Panther*. These aren't emerging countries, so it's really impressive.

## Never mind that. What about *Infinity War*?

*Captain Marvel* is doing better overseas than *Black Panther*. Could it even stand up to the behemoth that is *Infinity War*?

In a word, no.

Mojo lists box office results for both films in 44 territories. In 43 of those, *Infinity War* wins. There are a couple where things are close - Indonesia stands out - but generally *Captain Marvel* is making between one and two thirds of the box office of *Infinity War*. The exception is Ukraine, where *Captain Marvel*'s opening weekend was $27,000 up on *Infinity War*. That's about 2% extra.

What does this tell us for *Endgame*? Well, better numbers for *Captain Marvel* than previous standalones could suggest that the MCU fanbase has expanded overseas, but obviously it's nothing as dramatic as the expansion between *The Avengers* and *Infinity War*. It could be due to other factors though, so let's not read too much into it. The main thing it tells us is HOLY SHIT *RAGNAROK* MADE SO MUCH MONEY IN INDONESIA AND UKRAINE. 

If you made it this far then I hope you found my post interesting.",boxoffice,43,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/b1loyf/international_captain_marvel_vs_the_mcu_an/,,Dr_Vesuvius,b1loyf,/r/boxoffice/comments/b1loyf/international_captain_marvel_vs_the_mcu_an/,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/b1loyf/international_captain_marvel_vs_the_mcu_an/,14,2019-03-15

"Theory for endgame, that introduces Eternals, mutants and reboots earth continuity... it works.","Here me out....  Basic synopsis...

1. Remaining  avengers go back in time and introduce Stark Tech to Titan, preventing  worldwide catastrophe on Titan and preventing the creation of the mad  titan....could even have interactions between stark and young thanos in a  positive way... This could explain their seemingly linked connection.
2. The  Eternals of Titan prosper(we know a movie is being made), their  successful expansion allows them to intervene on other worlds, thereby  creating the introduction of the X gene into the human populace in the  past (much like in the comics).
3. The  expansion of eternals, completely alters the cosmic timeline, allowing  for interactions with Galactus, Ego, all other cosmic entities and  introducing them to this new timeline...
4. Completely  reboots earth continuity as we know it... Allowing for some heroes to  change and return.  Spider man, Far from Home would be the first  introduction to this new timeline and explain the seemingly upbeat theme  of the movie....And could be the first introduction of mutants into the  cinematic universe...

We  know the Eternals (the people of titan)have to be brought back.... so i  believe this would be the only way to bring them back....",MarvelTheories,32,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelTheories/comments/b1kenv/theory_for_endgame_that_introduces_eternals/,,draccip,b1kenv,/r/MarvelTheories/comments/b1kenv/theory_for_endgame_that_introduces_eternals/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelTheories/comments/b1kenv/theory_for_endgame_that_introduces_eternals/,5,2019-03-15

SJWS are attacking CAPTAIN MARVEL over her MAKEUP! LMAOOOO," 

Woke Sjws are attacking the russo brothers and body shaming Brie larson captain marvel over the choice of putting makeup on captain marvel in the latest avengers endgame trailer...

So Brie larson has officially been body shamed by the people she constantly supports... the problem is that the character is wearing makeup which is apparently not part of her character?? lmao

Woke Sjws are the worst and they keep showing it...

They throw their own under the bus the moment they make one mistake in there view...

Sjws attack marvel whenever they get a chance and now they are attacking Avengers Endgame since it isn't feminist enough

Wokeness is a huge problem right now... people are afraid to express their opinion because of the outrage culture that will destroy their careers if they say something a certain group of people dont like.

Honestly this is just hilarious how Brie is essentially being attacked for doing a feminine thing when she was all about GIRL POWER during the advertisement for Captain Marvel and the moment she does something a actual girl would do its suddenly DISGUSTING AND HORRIBLE

Shows how mental all these people really are

Oh and the russo brothers are white... shock... horror...

The Infinity Stones Can and Already HAVE BEEN Recreated in the MCU... Key to defeating Thanos in Endgame. (With Video Links),"The following pieces from the MCU are my submitted evidence that the Infinity Stones are not in fact unique in any way but are created from 6 non physical forces that exist in the universe by forming or “forging” them into physical matter...

THE EVIDENCE:

The Collector - Guardians of the Galaxy:
“Before creation itself, there were six singularities. Then the universe exploded into existence, and the remnants of these systems were FORGED into concentrated ingots... Infinity Stones.”

—They did not just appear, they did not randomly turn from non physical matter into physical matter... they were forged... by who has yet to be determined..—

Howard &amp; Tony Stark - Iron Man 2:

2 videos this time folks!

In Iron Man 2 Tony is given a film reel of his father Howard who says that the project he was working on in the film reel was his life’s work but that he was limited by the technology of his time. Tony then decodes the model left behind by his father to DISCOVER A NEW ELEMENT which TONY CREATES AND FORGES  FOR HIS REACTOR AND ITS NEVER TALKED ABOUT AGAIN.

Gamora/Thanos - Infinity War

This one is pretty straight forward as there isn’t much to work with here. As long as there are loved souls to sacrifice, one can create a soul stone. One must extract another’s soul to create it on Vormir.

"Avengers: Endgame Full Plot Prediction (WARNING: LONG, ALSO SPOILERS FOR INFINITY WAR, ANT-MAN AND THE WASP AND CAPTAIN MARVEL!)","(This was first posted on r/MCUTheories and has been re-posted here.)

This is a follow-up theory to my “Avengers: Endgame, Time Loop Theory”. While I’d recommend you go watch it, I don’t mention it in this theory, so it’s not required to understand it.

Second disclaimer: this is just a theory. Using bits from other theories, clips in trailers, set photos and leaks as well as story logic to tie the whole thing together, I’ve put this together into what I think will be the plot of Avengers: Endgame, but I don’t know any people that work for Marvel, nor do I know “inside information”.

Third disclaimer: bring some popcorn. This will be long.

&amp;#x200B;

Before we start, some miscellaneous predictions.

The snapped characters are dead – they can’t be in another world, unless one already existed, since its already established that anything Thanos creates soon disappears, as seen with both his imagery of Titan and what he did to Drax and Mantis. And if he do something small like creating infinite food or recreating an entire world, how is he able to make a whole new universe? Plus the Russos said that they’re dead for now, and the only other time they’ve lied is with the Avengers: Endgame title, which really isn’t that important. So… as of Endgame’s beginning, they’re dead.

Not all of the main six Avengers are going to die. For example, there’s not only going to be a larger emphasis on female superheroes going forward – and Black Widow was the first to appear in the franchise – but she has a prequel film coming up, and it’s going to be hard for the audience to get invested in a character that’s dead. Thor’s character just got rebooted and is widely regarded to be one of the most interesting new developments phase three has to offer, so he’s off the chopping block for the meantime. And, as much as people like to say that Hawkeye’s going to bite the dust, he’s only appeared in *four films before Avengers: Endgame*, only one film more than Black Panther and Spider-Man… plus, the possible introduction of Kate Bishop could introduce a new mentor-mentee dynamic between the two not unlike Hank Pym and Scott Lang. That leaves the only three vulnerable OG Avengers as Captain America, Iron Man and the Hulk/Bruce Banner. But if all three get killed off in the one movie, that could cheapen their individual sacrifices e.g. if Tony Stark and Bruce Banner were to die at the same time, then not only would it make Tony’s sacrifice feel less personal (since he’s the MCU Mascot basically) but it would also obviously take focus off Banner. TL;DR, I’m predicting one OG Avenger sacrifice, no more, no less.

With that out of the way, let’s begin. I’m covering what I think will be the whole film here, from start to finish.

&amp;#x200B;

**Act 1**

There will be the usual Marvel Studios introduction, but each of the characters that died at the end of Infinity War will turn to dust, and if any lines appear that were spoken by snap victims, they too will turn to dust.

The first scene will be Hawkeye, with his family, as is shown in the trailer. The girl training with him will be his daughter, who may or may not become the next Hawkeye (replacing Kate Bishop) in this continuity. She, along with his wife and kids, will be dusted by the snap, and Clint, a broken man, will flee the scene.

Cut to Tony and Nebula in the Benetar. Tony will be delivering his final message to Pepper Potts as shown in the trailers, before Nebula happens to find some Anulax Batteries left on the ship. They realise they can use them to return to earth, and the last shot of this scene is them preparing. Tony tells Nebula that, when they make it back, he could use someone like her in Stark Industries, and Nebula grins. Cue title card and triumphant Avengers theme tune.

This next bit is Steve finishing and coming back from the therapy group, and then it’s basically the Captain Marvel post-credit scene, as the Earthbound Avengers gather and are confronted by Captain Marvel, who asks, “where’s Fury?”

We then see Wakanda, where Thor and Rocket have been living since the snap, as Thor is far too depressed to act and, through flashbacks, we see the attack on Thanos via Stormbreaker from his perspective, as well as him refusing to go home with Steve, Nat, Rhodey and Bruce. We also get a brief cameo from Okoye as she is forced to take over as Wakanda's temporary leader after the deaths of T'Challa and Shuri. After some convincing from Rocket, who is also depressed but faces depression with anti-nihilism, the two of them use the Bifrost to head to the Avengers compound.

We cut back to the Avengers compound, where the Earthbound Avengers are explaining to Captain Marvel the situation. Captain Marvel reveals that many of her close friends had turned to dust. At this point, it is nearing night-time, so Steve, Nat, Rhodey, Bruce and Carol crash. Steve has nightmares about the snap, before he and the rest are awoken by Captain Marvel, as the Benetar is landing. Tony and Nebula arrive on it, and Thor and Rocket arrive on the opposite side of the compound.

Now, Steve, Tony, Thor, Bruce, Nat, Rocket, Nebula, Carol and Rhodey are at the compound. They are all discussing the situation, and Tony and Steve are, for the most part, trying not to interact, and if they do, they try not to look at each other.

Nat mentions that she needs to go find Clint, and so heads to Tokyo to find him as Ronin. At this point, Ronin has previously fought and beaten Hiroyuki Sanada’s character, who could become the next Shang-Chi.

(Stan Lee mentioned that A:IW and A:E would introduce multiple new fan-pleasing characters, and introducing Shang-Chi and the next Hawkeye would definitely fulfil that promise.)

She and Clint return to HQ, and in the meantime, Rocket and Nebula are talking, as are Steve, Tony, Thor and Bruce, with Steve and Tony making awkward small talk while the pair try to get them to interact. Now “all of them” (obviously excluding Ant-Man, but we’ll get to him) are at the compound, the scene from the shareholders meeting ensues, with the group heading off to “the garden” to fight Thanos. We see a shot of Thanos contemplating his actions, and he is smiling as the heroes land.

The Avengers &amp; Guardians land, and they immediately attack Thanos. The group do well against him, better than the Pseudo-Vengers on Titan, and much better than the Avengers defending Vision in Wakanda. Eventually, they have him pinned down, but Thanos reveals that the Infinity Gauntlet is irreparably damaged, and even if the Avengers managed to get it off him, they couldn’t perform a feat as powerful as the snap that had the opposite effect. Rocket confirms this is true, and Steve angrily turns to forcibly make Thanos face justice, but the Mad Titan has teleported away.

Disheartened, the Avengers &amp; Guardians return on their course to earth, and will be pretty much convinced that they’ve lost everything: they couldn’t bring their friends back, and they couldn’t even get revenge on Thanos.

Now, I don’t think that our heroes will be able to beat Thanos the first time, as it’ll take multiple attempts. See the official Endgame description online: “Since our heroes couldn’t stop Thanos the first time, what makes them think they can win in a rematch? The answer may be an overwhelming power thanks to Captain Marvel or in the tiniest spaces between atoms accessible to Ant-Man.” This hints at the two resurrection plans present in Endgame, one being to fight Thanos and force him to bring the heroes back, and one being to use their wits and skills within the Quantum Realm.

&amp;#x200B;

**Act 2**

This is where Scott Lang comes in. The scene from the first trailer happens, where Scott Lang shows up at their front door, right after the scene from the second trailer happens, where Scott Lang is wandering around aimlessly. However, his presence doesn’t do much to motivate the group, as they say there’s nothing that can bring their loved ones back.

Tony digs out his old B.A.R.F. technology, and tells his allies that, if they couldn’t bring them back, they can at least relive their memories, because they won’t ever move on.

Cut to Steve reliving his memories of the Battle in Lagos, where he fought Crossbones but also fought alongside Black Widow, Falcon and Scarlet Witch (cue the Crossbones cameo). Then he relives the Battle of New York, where he was at his happiest: surrounded by all his teammates when life was simple. Tony joins him, and the two of them talk, this time making some effort to confront the issues but still avoiding them, similar to their talk in Civil War. Meanwhile, Scott Lang is downstairs, reliving his last memories of Hank, Janet and Hope, before he has a eureka moment, remembering that he brought the van with the Quantum Tunnel with him, and that Janet Van Dyne said something about Time Vortexes.

He goes to get Steve, Tony and the others, and they all regroup. Tony makes them specialised Quantum Realm suits, and this is where the big awesome scene with them walking through the compound happens, as they have a plan.

Their plan is for Tony, Bruce and Rocket to make a new Infinity Gauntlet. However, since they can’t collect Infinity Stones from Thanos, the past or other universes, they’ll have to match the energy signature created by the snap using *other artefacts from across the multiverse.* While they can collect the Super Soldier Serum and the Essence of Surtur from the present, since Mjolnir was destroyed and the Ultimate Nullifier isn’t even from the MCU, they’ll have to back in time and visit another universe respectively. The other two things, Healing Particles from the Quantum Realm and energy from the Dark Dimension, will require the Quantum Realm anyway.

(Also, those wristwatches the group wear in concept art? Yeah, those are to automatically recall them to just outside of the van, similar to how Hank Pym was meant to recall Scott before the Decimation.)

First of all, Thor Bifrosts to Nidavellir (Eitri died in the snap) to get the Infinity Gauntlet mould, before Bifrosting back and then placing it on the table. This is where the group split up.

Steve and Tony go to Siberia to find some Super Soldier Serum, while Thor goes back in time to when he was in Doctor Strange’s Sanctum in Ragnarok to borrow Mjolnir and Captain Marvel, War Machine, Black Widow, Hawkeye and Ant-Man go to absorb Surtur’s Essence. Steve and Tony settle their differences once and for all in Siberia, and the pair are back to talking openly with each other. They return, and while they were out, Bruce Banner and Rocket were bonding, with Bruce Banner talking about his issues with the Hulk, and even hulking out when Rocket pokes him with a metal instrument in a call-back to Avengers: Assemble. Rocket and Hulk, as stated by the directors, strike up a friendship, before Bruce forces himself back into the driver's seat and asks Rocket never to do that again, as hulk can be incredibly dangerous. Nebula is guarding their work by patrolling the outside of the compound, and has flashbacks to Thanos pulling her apart, before remembering Gamora hugging her and almost crying since she lost the person who she knows cares about her.

Tony then visits the Sanctum in the present to find Wong, and asks him how to channel the Dark Dimension. Wong refuses at first, before Tony says that Strange said “there was no other way”. Wong has a eureka moment and tells Tony how to do it, but says that there will be terrible consequences. Tony goes along with this anyway – like Strange said, “there was no other way”.

So, four out of the six components have been gathered. Unfortunately, there’s still the matter of the Ultimate Nullifier, which is found in an entirely different universe. This time, the original six Avengers go on one last mission, this time involving stealth, to take the Ultimate Nullifier from another universe, after realising that their universe will work fine without it. During this time, Rhodey strikes up a friendship with Rocket, and reveals how disillusioned he is about everything: he joined the army and the Avengers to protect people, but now, so much has happened, he doesn’t know if the world is even worth protecting. Rocket convinces him that it is, and says that he’s lost a lot of people, but he’s still going to carry on, whether it’s hope or spite that carries him forward.

They return back, and everything seems fine: the team is all back together, they’re almost ready to reverse the snap, and Thanos is nowhere to be seen. Except the next shot is of Thanos: thanks to the Infinity Gauntlet, he has sensed the creation of another Gauntlet due to the similar energy signatures, and now decides to go after the Avengers. The next fight scene, and second-act-climax, is at Avengers HQ.

Our heroes are almost completely unprepared as Thanos attacks the compound with hordes of outriders. They fight him, but almost nothing works: even Captain Marvel fails as the unconscious bodies of Avengers and Guardians are laid across the floor. Stormbreaker is broken in the conflict, and Tony’s myriad of suits are destroyed to boot, in a fashion similar to Iron Man 3. The compound is completely obliterated.

There are multiple one-on-one fights between Thanos and other heroes: the first is Thor, who loses as Thanos is aware of how strong he is this time *and* catches him by surprise to boot – this is where Stormbreaker gets broken. Bruce then tells Hulk that if he fights for him, he can permanently have his body. So, then the Hulk fights him, and puts up a better fight than on the Asgardian refugee ship, but still gets beaten by Thanos. Cap, Tony, Natasha and Clint will only fight outriders, while Thor, Hulk, Rocket, Nebula, Scott, Rhodey and Carol will fight him in a group before they start fighting him one-on-one after everyone except Thor and the Hulk are put out of action.

Then Tony reactivates the Quinjet, and asks Rocket, Ant-Man and Bruce to take away Natasha, Clint, Thor, Steve, Carol, Rhodey and Nebula, leaving himself behind to take down Thanos single-handedly. He knows he can’t beat Thanos, and intends to hypothetically “lay down on the wire” as it were. There are flashbacks of his whole life onwards from meeting Yinsen as Tony starts off doing alright, but since this particular matchup has already happened before, the Mad Titan begins to lay a brutal smackdown. Then, just as he’s about to strike the killing blow…

He’s hit in the face with Mjolnir.

Cap’s holding it, revealing that he never left with the ship and proving that he is now worthy to hold Mjolnir. Thor is there too, and he leaves with Tony’s battered body while Steve now takes on Thanos with his Shield and Thor’s hammer as the credits theme from the Winter Soldier plays. However, he finally falls dead, and only Thor is able to witness the death of Captain America as he flies away, Mjolnir flying back to his hand after Cap's last battle is over.

&amp;#x200B;

**Act 3**

Cut to Avengers Tower, the new place where the heroes sans Steve are residing, and where Pepper Potts already is. Iron Man wakes up from what he thinks is a horrific nightmare, but is actually the truth. He really did just witness Steve’s death. Thor is without Mjolnir, as he has returned it to the past, to keep the timeline unaltered.

Tony needs some time, and leaves the tower, with both Rhodey and Pepper going after him. There, he meets Harley Keener, who has run off after his mum died in the snap, and Tony, reminded of Peter, realises what he’s fighting for. With Harley’s help, Tony manages to build a brand-new suit for Rhodey, and the two of them return with a brand-new War Machine suit, specialised to fight Thanos: the Warbuster Armour.

All of the OG Avengers are upset, but realise that they have to move on, for his sake. They enter the Quantum Realm one last time with the Gauntlet to prepare for one final battle, but they find Thanos there, who was aware of their plan. He fights them for trying to undo his “universe-saving act”, but they eventually collect enough healing particles. The fight ends with a bit of a recreation of Avengers: Infinity War where the Avengers tried to stop Thanos from getting to Vision, though, in this case, it’s Thanos who is trying to stop the Avengers from completing something and not the other way around. There’s another one-on-one fight between Thanos and the Warbuster armour, while Nebula tries desperately to absorb all of the Healing Particles she can. The Warbuster armour is just strong enough to hold Thanos before Nebula collects all of the particles required for the new gauntlet – however, Rhodey dies in the attack, giving Tony one last smile before Thanos downs him.

They succeed, and Nebula wields the new Infinity Gauntlet. However, Thanos reveals to her that the balance of the stones was the only thing that kept him from dying: however, she doesn’t have that protection, so if she snaps, then she dies as well, and that she’s only making another rash decision. He also says that, if everybody comes back, her death will be forgotten, and nobody will care about her. Nebula replies that she’s done being rash, the costs are worth it and snaps her fingers.

She’s transported to a place similar to where Thanos was after snapping, where she meets a grown-up Gamora. They talk for a bit, before she’s back in the Quantum Realm. Nebula seems to be fine, and the people in the real world are revealed to be returning as they speak.

Then she starts to turn to dust as well.

Tony and Rocket are the most upset, with Tony already being distraught after the death of his lifelong best friend, but she is satisfied as she fades away. She’s finally done something purely, completely good in her life, with no complications, and, by snapping her fingers, she also brought Gamora back too.

In addition, all heroes, regardless of where they were in the real world when the snap hit them, appear in the Quantum Realm to fight Thanos – Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Fallen Avengers, you name it – and Thanos summons the Chitauri and Outriders to combat these. This is where the big, forty-character sequence happens that was teased.

Scarlet Witch, Hulk, Black Widow, Okoye, Black Panther, Rocket, Groot, Falcon and Bucky Barnes go for the Outriders, while Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, Mantis, Spider-Man and Captain Marvel go for the Chitauri. Meanwhile, Doctor Strange traps Thanos in a pocket dimension and Iron Man, Thor, Peter Quill, Drax and Gamora go after him to fight him, one last time. Doctor Strange also asks Tony about the Quantum Realm and the snap before Tony cuts him off, fitting with what Tom Holland spoiled in an interview as he said Benedict Cumberbatch would be talking about “Quantum Realm… stuff.”

They each beat him down, for the loss of Captain America, War Machine and Nebula, and they fight him, before Gamora lands the killing blow and Thanos apologises to her in a quiet moment, before Tony tells Thanos, “I hope they remember you.” This is Tony telling Thanos implicitly that he understands what he’s trying to do by saving the universe, and the lesson he tried to deliver, however brutally delivered, won’t be wasted. Thanos nods slightly, and dies satisfied, as Tony and the others flee.

Cut to a heartwarming montage of Tony returning Peter to his house as he hugs a tearful Aunt May; Scott Lang embracing his daughter, Maggie and Paxton similar to the scene from Ant-Man and the Wasp; Hawkeye seeing his whole family alive again; Nick Fury standing at the bedside of Captain Marvel, who wakes up and smiles at him, Goose in his arms; Black Panther holding Nakia’s hand as they are standing in Shuri’s lab, where the scientist is repairing Vision using parts from the new Gauntlet as Scarlet Witch and Okoye look on; Doctor Strange visiting Wong in the Sanctum; the fallen Guardians reuniting with Rocket; and, finally, Thor talking with a vision of Loki one last time.

Then we see the United Nations building, as Thunderbolt Ross is giving a speech about how they were wrong about Superheroes being dangerous and more trouble than they’re worth, and that the Accords have now officially been abolished. Hulk has also transformed back into Banner, saying that he didn’t want control, just a friend, in his own hulk-like way. While this is happening, we see Tony talking to Peter about being a part of the new Avengers lineup, but Peter denies it, saying that he wants more of a normal life now. Once Peter leaves, Sam walks up to Tony, and the two of them talk about the deaths of Steve Rogers and James Rhodes. Tony says that if he needs anything, he’ll be there for him, and Sam says that he can counsel him through their deaths if he wants him to. At that point, Ross calls up Tony to the stage, and he talks about the new Avengers lineup: Black Widow, Hulk, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Vision and… Carol steps up, introducing herself as Captain Marvel, getting her title from her admiration of Steve, meaning that the exchange of names between herself and Steve has now gone two ways.

Tony then gives a speech similar to Nick Fury’s “there was an idea” speech, replacing some words here and there, but ending it with, “Steve Rogers died believing in that idea… in heroes. Well… it’s an old fashioned notion. But it’s not wrong. We’re the Avengers. We’re here for a reason. And, like the old man said… we fight to the end of the line.”

Roll credits, which this time are the different actors' names and scenes from the movie forming from dust.

&amp;#x200B;

**Post-Credit Scenes**

I think there will be five post-credit scenes, similar to Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.

The first will be Steve and Rhodey’s joint funeral (since Nebula was obliterated after performing the second snap, she can’t get a normal funeral). Everybody will be heartbroken, not least Sam, Bucky, Tony and the other OG Avengers. Tony will ask to speak with Bucky after the funeral, and explicitly apologises to him, and asks if they can directly be allies again, since that’s what Steve would have wanted. Bucky accepts, and the two part ways, Bucky going to Wakanda to live out a peaceful life and Tony going on his honeymoon, saying he won’t be seeing the other heroes for a long time.

The second will centre around the Guardians of the Galaxy, with Thor going with them as he wants to have some respite from being the King of Asgard. Since Asgard is left with no ruler, and Captain Marvel is abandoning the Skrulls under her care to become the leader of the Avengers, the Skrulls join up with Valkyrie and the Asgardian refugees, with Asgard now becoming, not a galactic utopia, but a safe haven for all alien races.

The third will feature a meeting between the Avengers that fought after Thanos’s snap, one month after the Resurrection. It shows Clint’s daughter and Scott’s daughter Cassie talking away from all of the grown-ups, sharing stories of their superhero parents. They say that they should grow up to be superheroes as well, and this will set the scene for a young Avengers movie.

The fourth will take place in the universe that the original six Avengers visited to get the Ultimate Nullifier, with a man finding the place where the heroes exited the Quantum Realm, tracing its energy and opening up another portal. He creates a vision of Scarlet Witch, and says that, “it’s a shame she doesn’t even remember who her father is. Well… that’s to be expected. Guess I’ll have to find her and tell her the truth.” It’s Magneto, and this is how “nothing is the same” after Endgame: the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) becomes the MCM (Marvel Cinematic Multiverse), featuring multiple universes and time periods.

The fifth and last post-credit scene starts with Steve’s death from the end of the second act. Then he appears in the ballroom he did in his Age of Ultron nightmare… except that this is his personal heaven, as he gets to dance with Peggy Carter, one last time, before everything goes white and the ‘MARVEL’ card appears.

End of movie.

Sorry if it’s a lot to take in. But, based on all of the evidence given, this is the best theory I could come up with that strings it all together.

Obviously, leave your own theories in the comments below, I’d be delighted to hear them – or, if you’ve found a flaw in my theory, then I’d also love to hear that, so I can make this more accurate.

I don't know if it's too much to ask but could we have better visual indicators for when WPSs proc?,"I now use 5 WPS: Markovian's Advantage, Belgothian's Shears, Whirling Death, Execution, and Direwolf Claw. (As an aside, could you buff Direwolf Claw to 15% proc so I proc 100% of the time? Hehe)

As it stands, only Whirling Death is discernible. Execution looks the same as Markovian Advantage and Belgothian's Shears is the same with Direwolf Claw. Things get hard to see when you're surrounded. Maybe some slight color effects could pop up?

I'd like to get a better visual confirmation because things like MA reduce DA and BS stuns. Execution is an endgame Nightblade skill yet it just looks like my hero just stabs both weapons at the same time. It also has reduction in HP. 

I guess it can also increase satisfaction levels if I can see Execution proc in succession. I know it can add visual clutter but I don't know Crate's policy about this.

"You know, even if the endgame would turn out to be non-existent or garbage the game would still totally be worth its money just for the singleplayer experience","Probably the vast majority of people went into the game to find an MMO game with a neat endgame to play for quite some time. But even if you would strip all that and stop right when the endgame opens up you would still have had a great game until then.

This game is actually better than a lot of singleplayer games. And on top of that, it is also an MMO. It is crazy how well made this is.

Why The First Avenger's Endgame Trailer Is Bullshit,"(No Spoilers Except The Trailer, Avenger's Endgame)

So at the end of the trailer we see Steve and Nat looking at a video of Antman at the door and Cap asks ""Is this an old message?""

That line has stuck out to a lot of people because, in my opinion, it's a weird reaction to seeing somebody ring the doorbell. People have speculated about time travel and weird theories about why they might be surprised to see Scott, but I have a different take.

Wouldn't it make MUCH more sense for him to be talking about an actual message? I've never seen someone ringing my doorbell and done anything but check the actual door to confirm. As luck would have it, we already have someone recording a message in the VERY SAME TRAILER:

Tony recording the message for Pepper on his helmet. 

My theory is that they're trolling us with that Antman clip. The way the audio is processed when it pans back to Cap's face is a little strange, I think it will later be replaced by the message we hear from Tony, and Antman will show up much later. 

SPOILERS FROM THE SECOND TRAILER:

You'll notice during the infamous ""new quantum whatever suit"" walking scene that Nat's hair is already long and red. It's the only shot we see of her and Scott in the same scene. It's possible, but unless Antman is with them for a long time it doesn't make sense for her to have the short, blond hair during his video message from the first trailer.

I think they get a message from Tony, and have to spend a while rescuing him which would account for the hair change, but I may be reading into nothing here.

[Endgame] Thanos' status,"At the end of IW, we can see that Thanos has been severely injured by the snap and the gauntlet itself is wrecked. The Russos also stated that both were permanently damaged. We also see Thanos on the new Endgame poster, but he's more in the background as if he has less of a role in the upcoming movie.


This leads me to believe that he will have more of a passive role in the movie (atleast post Infinity War Thanos). On a side note, theres a very good broad theory floating around that Endgame will have the heroes searching for Thanos to have him undo the snap and failing in the first half then they will use Quantum Realm to try to fix things. Im buying into that overall plot outline, which leads back into my more specific theory. The heroes will seek out Thanos, find him, but they will be unsuccessful with having him reverse the snap. I dont think theyll end up fighting him though. I believe that by the time the heroes get to him, he'll be unable to fight (too weak from the snap)! We see him limping at the end of IW and in that field scene in the first Endgame trailer. We also see that the gauntlet may be fused to his arm/hand which means it cant be taken off. Thanos skin, muscles and bones may be too strong to cut through....Its also possible that the damaged gauntlet doesnt protect the wearer from the power of the stones' as much anymore, which could mean subsequent uses could literally kill the bearer (Thanos was already injured from the snap). Also the damaged gauntlet may not be able to harness the power from multiple stones at once. (Alternate take: Possibility that Thanos does fight, but is easily defeated.... Heroes still unable to reverse snap bc of damaged gauntlet being fused to Thanos) 

To sum this up... Heroes visit Thanos on Titan 2. Reversing the snap is impossible (not necessarily bc he refuses to.... But maybe he cant mainly due to the damaged gauntlet not being able to handle all the power at once. It would be a cool arc to see Thanos remorseful, but unable to set things right.... Since the heroes cant undo the snap, they must then regroup and figure out another way.

A quick side note about Thanos in general. Throughout the mcu, Thanos has been teased as a merciless, unstoppable force. The IW marketing even paints him that way. But as we see him in the actual IW movie, he's more relatable and not as menacing as we were lead to believe going in. Russos and writers did a great job with this. I believe theyll do this again with Thanos. The ending of IW probably has a lot of ppl thinking that Endgame will be heroes vs Thanos part 2, but it wont be about that. There wont be a fight between present day Thanos and the heroes. There will be more dialogue between them which will be more frustrating for the heroes bc they wont be able to punch their way out of this situation.

So I got Mr. Downes killed,"SPOILERS FOR THE ENDGAME

Weird turn of events here

So I've still been reeling from losing Arthur after beating the game this past weekend. I went through the denial stage, hoping there was some way to prevent him from getting sick, but I know there's no such luck. 

However, on my current 2nd playthrough, I got to Valentine and saw Downes there. I knew the game probably wouldn't let me kill him, but I figured I'd try anyway, maybe it would give me a weird bit of closure. 

Im pointing the gun at him and it won't let me fire, but after a few seconds he bolts away from his charity stand and goes running off into the trees. I chase him on horse hoping maybe I can trample him or lasso him, but no dice. He eventually makes his way back into Valentine, and now my crime has been reported. Police start shooting at me, meanwhile I'm still running after Downes. I decide to run in front of Downes to see if their bullets can affect him, and to my surprise, they did! 

Three bullets strike him dead. 

I know this is just a loophole and doesn't affect the story. Im sure he'll be right back alive and at his farm come time for the mission. But it still feels like I cheated death for the time being, and avenged my other Arthur's death. 

Didn't expect any of that to work, but thought it was interesting how it played out.",reddeadredemption,226,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/b1pbv8/so_i_got_mr_downes_killed/,Spoiler,gothicfabio,b1pbv8,/r/reddeadredemption/comments/b1pbv8/so_i_got_mr_downes_killed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/b1pbv8/so_i_got_mr_downes_killed/,29,2019-03-16

"An honest criticism of the mentality of ""why use X frame when Y frame is better?""","Playing through missions and lurking region chat a lot, and looking through a lot of videos and even a bit on the forums, I've seen a lot of conversations about frames boil down to ""why use a frame when another frame does its job but better."" The thing is, if we extend this logic, why are we even playing the game? Why is DE making new frames? If we only ever used the best frames, then we're left with Chroma, Harrow, Trinity, Volt, Mesa, and Equinox if we're being generous. Between the first 5 frames, you can do everything in the game with the utmost ease, and Equinox is the jack of all trades who can do multiple roles at once, if not as good as the others. Endurance mission? Mesa can just kill everything instantly. Need heals? Trinity has you covered. Defense mission? Your target isn't at risk if Mesa one-shots the universe. Breathing Vay Hek's air? Chroma will shut him up with a well placed rubico bullet. Not doing enough damage? Harrow gives you more crits and Volt gives you double damage. Need to CC? Harrow can throw a few chains down. Need to go fast? That's Volt's entire thing.

When we boil it down this far. What even is the point? The entire game is a spreadsheet, and these frames have the biggest numbers, or enable the other frames listed to have the biggest numbers possible.

I'm not saying there's no joy to be had in seeing damage in the hundreds of thousands, if not in the millions. But what I am saying is that, if we keep acting like every frame has to be held up to the standards of the very best frames in the game, we will get more power creep, and we'll just keep shifting the goal post. I don't want to see a day where Mesa is considered bad because she doesn't instantly finish a mission the second she loads in and presses a single ability that kills every enemy on the map, because that's the logical extreme of this mentality if DE were to adhere to it in creating new frames.

Frames do need to be given upkeep to ensure they don't become completely impossible to use, power creep is an inevitability in games like this if they want to keep making new content for endgame, but at the same time, you shouldn't disparage people for using frames that are sub optimal, especially in pubs.

tl;dr: Please stop with the frame elitism. I don't like the meta playstyle, I just want to throw fireballs at enemies in peace.",Warframe,129,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/b1ods9/an_honest_criticism_of_the_mentality_of_why_use_x/,To Be Flaired,Chaincat22,b1ods9,/r/Warframe/comments/b1ods9/an_honest_criticism_of_the_mentality_of_why_use_x/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/b1ods9/an_honest_criticism_of_the_mentality_of_why_use_x/,158,2019-03-16

Lo que estaban esperando - Meet up 23/03 - Ex Bulgaria,"Bueno, como ya había avisado en la anterior salida al cine, y como estuvieron preguntando millones de veces a pesar de que ya habia dejado información en ese thread, inauguramos la temporada de mitaps 2019.

Hay mucha gente nueva en el sub así que paso a relatar un poco de que va la movida:

Nos juntamos a escaviar y comer.

Eso, basicamente.

Vamos a tener el bar para nosotros solos abierto toda la noche, ya estuve gestionando que nos hagan unas promos especiales

Donde va a ser esto?  En:

#EX  BULGARIA - AV. GAONA 1623

A pasitos del Cid Campeador, donde se hizo la mitap global el año pasado.

#ARRANCA A LAS 21HS

El lugar acepta EFT, credito, debito, mercado pago, patacones y lecop.

Quienes van? Todo el que tenga ganas de venir

Hay grupo de wasap/telegram? Para que si esta toda la info aca.  Si quieren hacerse uno por zona o barrio, adelante, lo que es yo no le veo sentido.

Se conocen todos entre ustedes? No se conoce nadie.

Te puedo invitar una cerveza Thotila? Por supuesto!

Asi que ya saben, sabado 23, se emperifollan, se lavan bien las ingles y se vienen.

Que se viene?  Viernes 26/4 r/Argentina va al cine S03E02.  Muy probablemente sea en un Hoyts de nuevo porque no se consiguen 2x1 en otro lado.  Avengers Endgame, esten atentos a esto porque muy posiblemente se pongan las entradas a la venta a fin de este mes.

More Voyager AI Upscaling Tests,"[here](https://imgur.com/a/ft9RQPS) are some side by side examples of my latest attempts at upscaling Voyager to 4K from a relatively low quality source, based on the excellent work of CaptRobau.

This time, I decided to set the 'Noise &amp; Blur Reduction' to the highest setting. The problem is, this particular setting will either vastly improve the image, or destroy it completely. It's relatively poor with reconstructing realistic organic (human) features for example.

However, I'm having great fun with this, trying to see just how much detail can be reconstructed from the current low quality releases of Voyager (and DS9)

If anyone's interested, I can post the video of this sequence. It's from the Endgame part 2 opener recap. The video definitely does highlight the faults in this approach, for every scene that works great, another looks relatively poor.",startrek,73,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/b1wkl4/more_voyager_ai_upscaling_tests/,,scragnog,b1wkl4,/r/startrek/comments/b1wkl4/more_voyager_ai_upscaling_tests/,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/b1wkl4/more_voyager_ai_upscaling_tests/,40,2019-03-16

Spore in 2019!,"Spore! The no mans sky of 2008! Although I personally think Spore were a great game, it could have been so much more! Spore played a big part in my childhood, (Tho I am still I child) and its sad to see how this good game could have been great! 

&amp;#x200B;

When I found out EA deleted so many things that should have been implemented just to release the game on time, I were furious. So, since the age of 10 I've learned programming, graphic design, and all around about game development. Just so I could say, I want a spore 2, and if EA isn't gonna make it, then I am.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems some people are already doing this, (Link: [http://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/](http://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/)) and I'm prolly gonna sign up for that, because I'm also very interested in the scientific part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I wanted to ask you all, (Who played Spore) What would you have loved to see in a game like spore? More endgame material? Of course the aquatic stage... Hit me up.

This is my first post here, ty for reading it, Spore have changed my way of thinking, that may sound dramatic, but I'm a weird person ;)

Since alot of people keep oversimplifying the community's request for more loot as complaining and wanting easy mode im gonna try and explain as best I can why thats not at all the case.,"So. In most looter shooters loot works one of two ways

1. The super rare loot drop is hella... Well... Rare. BUT when you do get the loot then you have it in its final form. No chance for it to get a trash perk or ability. Your grind for that item is officially done
Examples: Destiny's Vex Mythoclast ,Gjallarhorn, Thousand Voices. Shit like that. It took me a year to get Gjallarhorn in Destiny 1. Could you imagine how shitty It wouldve been if it came with slideshot?

2. Loot galore but several variables usually prevent you from getting that god roll right away. The Division can be a good example. The game drops most exotics and highly sought after gear like candy and can even be shared and rerolled to attempt to make it a god roll. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. When you go for a specific item though like it most games it gets pretty tough. Borderlands and Diablo III do this system best though.

Anthem's issue is it seems to be taking the downsides of both these types of loot systems. Loot is rare as hell AND has a chance to be horrible. Grinding for a Legendary for a week and getting it with 8% Assault Rifle ammo is demoralizing and not fun. Getting several a week gives you a small hint of hope and willingness to keep going. You may not get one every stronghold run but you still get one every other run. Now ik someone is gonna be like ""I got 6 in the past day"" you aren't everyone. You're you. Not everyone is gonna have that luck. Its entirely possible for someone to not get one all week. I know because I HAVEN'T SEEN ONE IN FOREVER..... Not the point though. Another flaw that shows up with this current loot system is that it is A LOT harder to hit max gear level than it really should be. WAIT. STOP TYING THAT GIT. I SEE THAT. What im saying is, getting to max level usually comes naturally with doing the endgame content. But since Legendaries are the next rarity needed this results in most people being stagnated where they are and never making an increase. This combined with never getting meaningful loot has driven players away and will most likely drive more simply due to the fact that there is no ""silver lining"". Example If I do a raid in Destiny I may get a gun I don't want. Sure I don't want it but the silver lining is I can now infuse this unwanted weapon into a weapon I use often. In Anthem if I get an masterwork I don't want its not like I can collect 5 of the same masterwork and upgrade it to a legendary variant or get 5 of a legendary and reforge it for a chance at a better inscription(yes that was a slick suggestion) im just SOL.

 
Im not saying we all want god rolls instantly. Im saying Anthem needs to choose one system instead of staying in the middle. Either leave Legendaries as is or maybe even DECREASE the odds of them dropping but give them a much better chance at being a good drop when you get them or INCREASE the drop rates of them but leave the randomness of the inscriptions alone (which already is happening). Anthem needs to have one or the other. Staying in the middle is just gonna drive more players away. But so far the gaming leaning towards my second example so now we just wait and see and hope its enough.

P.S. who do I bribe for a Legendary? Ben? Beeeeeen I know you need some Masterwork embers. Lets make a deal. No? What about Chris?

  Okay we all think that in Endgame the snap will be taken back, i mean its still a theory but likely to happen. I'm saying what if Avengers just dont take the snap back but also makes sure that Thanos never comes to Earth. If he never comes here then Graviton won't try to find more gratonium to stop him, right. That leads us to Daisy because she doesn't need to take the serum and Coulson takes instead of her. He lives. And the man we saw on 6th season teaser could be fake. I mean Marvel uses a lot fake scenes in trailers. AoS might as well can do that to mislead us. What do you think?

It’s amazing how important the whole Ant Man part of the MCU has become.,"I remember when Ant Man first came out, thinking it was just a side story in the MCU, not too important. But then Scott decided to sacrifice himself to stop yellow jacket, and ends up returning from the quantum realm. This leads to Hank attempting to save his wife and create the Quantum tunnel. And now it’s pretty clear this quantum tunnel/realm will be a major plot point in Endgame. Just another reason why the MCU has been so well thought out and crafted.

"I feel I will get heavily downvoted for this, but...","... am I the only person here who actually likes Serizawa? I see so much hate for her in various threads, but after recent chapters, I have grown to like her and even kinda have her as a pocket ship if Hina isn't Natsuo's endgame. Even wanted to put her as a user flair, but she isn't an option (but Momo is, lmao).

I liked how she got developed from a talented brat who always seemed to have her way into someone who learned humility and someone who actually put an effort into something (Natsuo). She put herself in a vulnerable spot to take a leap of faith and, although it failed, I think recent events have a vacancy in the shipping department.

At this point, I see both sisters as people who are ready and willing to support Nat (although Hina's seems borderline obsessive and unhealthy to her mental state), but lately it feels like they have become more of supportive best friends than actual love interests.

I was wrong about Captain Marvel...,Initially I wasn’t all that excited for the film from when the first trailer released back in September and over time I became less interested into it over time and the whole white men statement fiasco for sure caused me to dislike the film and I also feared that the movie would be some political movie rather than a superhero film. However I decided to go see the film anyways along with my date today and I have to same I’m happy to say that I LOVED THIS MOVIE. I heard many complaints say that the first Act was slow and confusing but I was very drawn into it from beginning to end and I LOVED how it connects with all the movies. After this I will for sure never doubt marvel studios. I also loved the Post credit scene which was brilliant.

Hull and information lack rant,"Dear EA,

I was so happy when monthly legend was Hull instead of Messier with crappy endurance everyone was anticipating. 

Bobby has been working so well for me previous years. His overall just hasnt been enough to be an endgame card. Thank god Bure was very similar last year so at 99 he was my #1LW even all the 99 evos were very affordable.

In the end this game should be about having fun and at least in my opinion it is much more fun to win than lose - with competitive players you like. For this reason I for one don't give a crap what he did irl and if he won't be back for this reason or any other whatsoever it's a really shitty thing to do to from EA.

Most ridiculous thing is that its been a week since he was removed and there is still no explanation nor replacement. 

There must be some limit how much shit one can take from EA.
I will for sure skip NHL20 if there is no option to get the card I wanted and was prepared for.

But there is that tution class I go to,most of the time I sit at a corner where nobody sits.Last week somehow something happened.After the avengers endgame trailer dropped everyone in that class were talking about it.I somehow gathered some confidence and barged in to the conversation  and then this conversation lead to more topics.They didn't judge me nor did they think I was a creep,moreover  they invited me to hangout with them.It was all on my head all along.I felt happy and confident though it was a small conversation I was proud I made a move.

So many frustrations in a fantastic game,"Ah man. So many prominent people have covered many issues with this league. The frustrations are numerous. 

* most of the league’s content is for the super-endgame. There’s almost no point in doing anything beforehand.

* for me, it’s actually super fun to plan the route of the nexus. Obviously being blocked off by random spawns is ridiculous - and not only that, the loot from even a sea of mods is really unrewarding. I hadn’t seen any videos before I ran my 10+ mod zones (only lvl 65 ish), and barely dropped a thing. It’s just deflating for all the effort!

* the worst part, is the performance issues I personally have faced. Entering any zone has become a lottery. Maybe 1 in 20 zones I enter results in a “disconnected” message. Has happened on two lab runs too. Then there’s entering a zone and having unbelievably lag to the point of having to reload

It’s just a bit of a mess. I’ll never not love this game. It won’t stop me playing - but it’s frustrating. Frustrating when you’ve put more into the game than a few AAA games combined, on the back of how great it is. At that point you kind of expect better. 

I hope the core mechanics are fixed - especially joe betrayal has been implemented too. But this league seems pretty dead to the casual. I’m already ignoring every single nexus missions in zones, and that’s a shame.

BUT, how do we know that those are the half he killed? What if that was the half that survived?

&amp;#x200B;

As we know, most of the original Avengers' contracts are expiring. So obviously, Marvel wants to maximize their story line and draw it to a close. So it would make sense to kill off the original Avengers, but those are exactly who they saved!? In addition, most of the fan favorites were the ones who died (for the most part).

&amp;#x200B;

So I think that Thanos used the reality stone to separate every being in the universe into one of two realities. Just as Cap, BW, Tony, etc. are so sad about losing Bucky, Strange, Spidey, etc. ; maybe in the other reality Spidey is mourning Tony, Black Panther is mourning Okoye, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my actual theory: Dr. Strange is the only one who knows what's going on. Since he can't look past his own death, he couldn't have died at the Snap to know that they win. Doctor Strange goes back in time and tries to communicate with the Avengers, but he can't because then he would break some time continuum. Luckily, he finds Ant-Man who managed to sneak through a time Vortex. Then, working together, they plant a video of Ant-Man in some SHIELD files that would only be accessed when the time is right. 

&amp;#x200B;

After dealing with the aftereffects of the Snap, Cap and BW would find the video and conclude the following:

&amp;#x200B;

They tried fighting Thanos separately in IW, didn't work. Now, they need to ""Avengers Assemble"" in order to win. However, they can't just travel between the realities, (that would be too easy). Everyone will have to travel through the Quantum Realm, back in time to get to a place where reality isn't split. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the movie will proceed from there (my theory is done). 

&amp;#x200B;

Buffing the loot on GM2 and GM3 doesn't really help the player experience if you leave GM1 a miserable slog.,"The gear required to do GM2 well is significantly better than the average gear provided by GM1 in a reasonable amount of time.  Even by *grinding standards*.  So players are left with a choice between a (almost the same) miserable slog on GM1 for way longer than is enjoyable and parasiting off of GM2/GM3 lobbies in hopes of getting better loot at a reasonable pace.  The only stronghold (read: *endgame content*) that got buffed is the currently unplayable Heart of Rage.

I didn't think it was possible, but a *theoretically* purely positive patch that buffed loot drop rates has actually made the game feel *worse* to play than it did in its prior state for someone who still only has the gear to reliably do GM1 content.",AnthemTheGame,19,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b1s0oq/buffing_the_loot_on_gm2_and_gm3_doesnt_really/,Support,mjack33,b1s0oq,/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b1s0oq/buffing_the_loot_on_gm2_and_gm3_doesnt_really/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b1s0oq/buffing_the_loot_on_gm2_and_gm3_doesnt_really/,32,2019-03-16

Future Marvel Studios movies and shows: what we know and speculation,"Now that Gunn is back with Marvel, I'm finally back to feeling excited about what's coming next and to start speculating again. Now with the Fox acquisition in 5 days, and Engame coming out in less than two months, a lot could change, but as far as we can tell, this is what's coming up for Marvel Studios (the dates are my best guess):

#Cinema

##Confirmed

* 2019, July 5: **Spider-Man: Far From Home**, Jon Watts directing

* 2020, May 1 or July 31: **Black Widow**, Cate Shortland directing

* 2020, November 6: **The Eternals**,  Chloé Zhao directing - film will feature Sersi and Ikaris

* 2021, February 12: **Shang-Chi**, Destin Cretton directing

* 2021, May 7 : **Black Panther 2**, Ryan Coogler directing - despite Coogler's desires to use Kraven The Hunter as a villain, Sony's developing a film with that character and due to Venom's incredible success, it is therefore unlikely they will share the rights

* 2021, November 5: **Doctor Strange 2**, Scott Derrickson directing - film will likely feature Mordo, Nightmare, and Namor has been teased as well

* 2022, May 6: **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3**, James Gunn directing - film will likely feature Adam Warlock, along with the origin of Rocket Raccoon.

##Likely

* *Spider-Man 3* - It's supposed that the Marvel-Sony contract was for three films. Right now, it's looking likely that the Osborns will feature in the third film, and thus why Stark Tower was sold in Homecoming. Scorpion's also a possibile villain, not to mention the Sinister Six. We'll have a better idea of the direction it will go come July 5th.

* *The Wasp* - Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp did great in China, and made enough money overall to merit a third film in the trilogy. It could nab the July 29th, 2022 date.

* *Captain Marvel 2* - With the first film being such a box office smash, Marvel will certainly want Carol to return to helm another film. This could be another prequel film a la Wonder Woman 1984, with Carol in a cosmic war against the Accusers and Starforce or adventures with the Skrulls, or it could be set in the present day, likely featuring Photon/Monica Rambeau.

##Possibilites

* *The Ravagers* - A cosmic adventure with Stakar, Martinex, Charlie-27, Aleta, Krugarr, and Mainframe as seen in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Could possibly even include a de-aged Yondu if there are any flashbacks.

* *A-Force* - many of the actresses in Marvel Studios films have expressed a desire to have a film together. We'll see if this ever becomes a reality.

* *Ragnarok sequel* - Taika Waititi has expressed interest in making a sequel to Ragnarok, no doubt including Valkyrie, Korg, and Miek. We'll have a better idea after Endgame as to what this film could look like.

* *Kamala Khan* - Feige has mentioned this is on his radar. Kamala could easily appear in a Captain Marvel sequel as well. 

* *Avengers 5* - Avengers is a cash cow and we all want to see the Phase 4 heroes team up. Surely another one of these will be coming soon enough.

* *Young Avengers* - Endgame might be teasing Stature/Stinger, Iron Lad, and Kate Bishop. We'll see if there are any further developments here.

* *Nova* - Guardians of the Galaxy showed us Rhomann Dey who recruited the original Nova. Marvel's pushing for more diversity in their films, so we might see a Sam Alexander film soon.

* *Miles Morales* - although Homecoming teased Prowler and this character, Into the Spider-Verse might have made this film redundant. There's also the possibility Sony decides to use the character in live-action themselves. We'll see what ends up happening. Safest bet would be for Disney just to buy the Spider-Man rights back, but after Venom and Into the Spider-Verse, I don't think Sony is going to sell for a long time.

##Fox-Marvel rights

With Fox-Marvel rights returning on March 20th, here's a look at what some of the movies most-likely to be fast-tracked could be:

* *Silver Surfer* - we haven't seen Silver Surfer on the silver screen for over 12 years. The character is prime for a return as he has an acclaimed series and could help introduce Galactus as a possible big bad for the next Phase. Maybe they'll even bring Doug Jones back.

* *The Fantastic Four* - the superheroes that would fit most easily into the MCU. Casting anyone besides John Krasinski and Emily Blunt for Reed and Sue would cause a fan outcry. To not repeat the mistakes of the Fox films, this film should be focused on the group's cosmic adventures. Astronauts from the 60s that got lost in a wormhole is a popular idea on how they could be seamlessly integrated into the MCU.

* *Uncanny/Astonishing X-Men* - there's so much here that it is a daunting task to integrate it into the MCU. We'll see how the post-Endgame world opens up the possibilty if at all, for mutants to join the MCU. The X-Men has such a plethora of well-known and popular characters that there are endless possibilties. Using a prefix like ""Uncanny"" or ""Astonishing"" would help differentiate this team from the Fox versions, and it's something Marvel hasn't shied away from before (i.e. The Incredible Hulk). One thing everyone is agreed on is that we need an orchestral version of the 90's X-Men theme.

* *Shadowcat* - Brian Michael Bendis wrote a script for Fox for Kitty Pryde, codenamed 143. Rumoured to be a horror/home invasion/solo based on when Kitty had to battle an invading demon while home alone in the mansion over Christmas. I'd say a little too out there for the MCU, and I don't see it surviving the merger.

* *Doctor Doom* - Noah Hawley wrote a script and has supposedly discussed it with the Russos and Feige. Supposedly a geopolitical thriller that is focused on a journalist interviewing Doom as he prepares to open Latveria for the first time. I also don't see this one surviving the merger either.

#Streaming

##Confirmed

* **Loki series**, Michael Waldron as showrunner - featuring the god of mischief popping up around human history and influencing events

* **The Vision and Scarlet Witch**, Jac Schaeffer as showrunner - rumoured to be a suburban psychological thriller where Wanda and Vision settle down in the suburbs

* **Falcon/White Wolf**, Malcolm Spellman as writer - rumoured to be a spy thriller

##Rumoured

* *Lady Sif/Beta Ray Bill* - rumoured to deal with Sif's banishment from Asgard

* *Hawkeye/Kate Bishop* - antagonist rumoured to be Trick Shot

* *War Machine*

* *Nick Fury* - possibly appearing in Falcon/White Wolf series instead

* *Moon Knight*

* *Sentry*

#Personal Speculation

* *Agents of Atlas* - because who wouldn't want to see Jimmy Woo (Randall Park) team up with a Gorilla and a Robot? Could work great as a series.

*S.W.O.R.D.* - with the Fox rights obtained, this could be a great way to evolve S.H.I.E.L.D. and would be a great new series with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ending in 2020.

* *Thunderbolts* - could be a great way to use Zemo, Goliath, Ghost, Hammer, Abomination, etc.

* *Avengers vs. X-Men* - with the Fox rights now, this has to happen at some point. Probably a very loose adaption like Civil War, just borrowing the name

* *Secret Wars*, *Secret Invasion*, *Annihilation* - there's a ton of events that could serve as the basis of future Avenger movies

* *Illuminati/World War Hulk* - Marvel has the characters now, we'll see if any of these stories are still viable post-Endgame

* *White Tiger*, *Squirrel Girl* - Marvel is looking to have highlight more diverse characters, one of these characters might get their day in the sun like Shang-Chi.

* *The Defenders* - the real Defenders, Doctor Strange + Hulk + Namor + Valkyrie. Who knows when the Marvel Studios can take back the name from Netflix, but it looks like the Doctor Strange sequel could be heading in this direction.

* *Daredevil*, *Luke Cage*, *Iron Fist*, *Heroes for Hire*, *Daughters of the Dragon* - any of these properties recently rescued from Netflix could be rebooted at this point, although the rights might affect the timing",marvelstudios,19,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/b1phix/future_marvel_studios_movies_and_shows_what_we/,,simon_thekillerewok,b1phix,/r/marvelstudios/comments/b1phix/future_marvel_studios_movies_and_shows_what_we/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/b1phix/future_marvel_studios_movies_and_shows_what_we/,11,2019-03-16
"Adventures from a past life, to adventures yet to come.","Hello everyone,                  
You may remember me as the tall lengthy Elvaan 75NIN/37THF soloing Colibri outside of Aht Urhgan Whitegate.                  
Or the voluptuous Asmodian Gladiator filling an alliance group to trek through the countless quests needed to complete in order to get rewarded your very own Golden Drakie Egg.                
Or the commanding officer turning in stacks and stacks of supplies to Hyrstmill, Aleport or The Golden Bazaar in order to get my Linkshell to the top of the leader board for Hamlet Defense.                   
                       
Many of you may have no idea what any of those mean. But that is the world where I am from. My MMO experience is different than it seems from many of the readers on this subreddit. I never played EQ, however it seems that what I love and desire from an MMO are mutual. I too feel a bit alienated being here and reading about EQ this and EQ that. It is a little overwhelming so I thought I would share some of my experiences with you all from a different point of view.                    
                        
The first mention above was from Final Fantasy XI Online. This is where I spent most of my MMO experience from 2002 to 2009. Even in 7 years I still only had 5 L75's. But that is because the game was all about the journey. Leveling up slowly and building gear sets for different play styles. The average night would consist of getting into a group, finding a camp, and maybe getting a little closer to your next level up. I remember the community being very close and respectful. If you were in an exp group and someone had to leave, that person or the Leader would attempt to find a rep for that person. And the person would wait till the rep got to the camp before they would leave. In some situations the entire group would have to backtrack to the beginning of the dungeon to pick up the rep and fight back down to the camp spot. And there was no true fast travel. Sometimes it would take the player 30 real time minutes to get from the town to the camp. This brought a sense of immersion and realism to the game. If you had to take a boat or airship ride from town to town, you literally had to sit and wait 15 real time minutes on that boat or airship till it arrived at its destination. At least on the boat you can Fish off the side. Or if you were unlucky and had to hide in the cargo hold when the Pirates boarded the ship. Sometimes you didn't have the map of the area because you never got it out of the Coffer somewhere hidden in the dungeon or you didn't do the certain quest to obtain it. You either had to have been there before and know the terrain or maybe someone from the party would come to the entrance and walk you to the camp. All part of the adventure.                     
Gear itself was very fun and at times very difficult to get. I remember the groups who would organize a few parties together for O-Hat runs. Anyone who needed to get their very own Optical Hat. All you would have to do is obtain your own pop item and join the group. Typically it would consist of around 15-18 people who either were helping friends or needed their own hat. They all fight their way through the Den of Rancor to the spawn location. One person uses their item and pops the monster. Everyone fights it and passes on the Hat to the person who's turn it was. Wait 15 minutes and repeat till everyone got their hat.                        
One of my personal favorite quests was the Pirates Chart Quest. First you had to be a L30+ Fisherman and fish up a whole bunch of certain type of fish that may have eaten the Chart. You take the fish to an NPC to gut them for a chance to find the Chart. Then you take the Chart and 2 friends with you to a certain beach where you would spawn 3 NM's who attach you. Killing them all makes the chest appear. Opening it up and with only a small 2% chance to get the rare Mercurial Kris Dagger. As soon as I saw that Dagger pop up in the Loot table I jumped for joy. Even though it wasn't the greatest sought after weapon, it was one of the very few multi hit weapon. It had the chance to occasionally attack 2 to 3 times per attach cycle. These weapons in general were typically heavily sought after because it significantly increased your ability to fill your TP gauge. Which means faster Weapon Skills. These were always my favorite. So I took my new shiny Dagger in the offhand of my NIN/THF and a low delay Katana in my Main, put on all of my Haste+ Gear which also lowered the delay for weapon attacks. And I would solo L70+ Colibri outside of Aht Urhgan just for the fun of it and watch my character seemingly attack nonstop pumping out Weapon Skill after Weapon Skill.                    
                         
I just wanted to make an honorable mention to the second and third characters I originally spoke of.  
         
Number 2 was describing a particular LONG chain of quests you had to do in the MMO AION in order to get a Pack Pet that held a whopping 18 items for you. It totaled 15 preliminary quests needed to complete in order for you to finally be able to pick up the quest for the Egg. These quests had you going all over the world and some of them needing Alliances of upwards of 24 players to complete. That little Pet Drakie was so worth the effort.                 
Number 3 was describing an endgame activity from FFXIV 1.0 where in there was a real time schedule for an event called Hamlet Defense. There was a downtime of 50 hours where you would turn in items towards a global supply rating that leveled up after reaching a certain number of points. The higher the rating the stronger the enemies would be during the Defense portion and the better Loot that could drop if you won the battle. The battle phase only lasted 25 hours then the whole event would reset and the rating back down to 0. So typically your guild would give stacks and stacks of items to one player to turn in to get that rating up and then during the 25 hour battle phase, repeat and repeat the battle over and over. But the coolest thing about this all was that you could perform in the battle section as a fighter, crafter or gatherer! You could literally be a party of 6 crafters or 6 gatherers and take part in the Defense battle and win. It had to do with running around the battle field picking up items to craft or items to gather and turning them into an NPC during the battle in order to Buff NPC's or Debuffing the Enemies which engaged in combat. (Some of you may have never heard about this because it was exclusive to 1.0 and was taken out in the release of ARR). Yes, I was loyal to the original vision of the game which ironically had much more risk vs reward that we have been seeking. I believe it could have been great if they didn't choose to scrap it for ARR. But you had to have been there to understand.                   
                      
In the end, these are the kinds of adventures I want to have again. And I am hoping Pantheon might fulfill that.

First FNM back in over half a year and went 4-0,"The main 60: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1721624

Keep in mind I got to the place late and was fast to put together a proper deck. There are many things to change like adding another land and changing the curve. I also did not have a really established sideboard for the meta so I decided not to include one here. 

Round 1: UR Phoenix 2-0
First time ever playing against Phoenix and I must say it blood moon felt really good here and light up the stage was a big help. Opponent was stumbling on mana as I managed to blood moon early on in both games and could not recover

Round 2: Blue Moon 2-1
Opponent was playing some sort of budget control of what I assumed was blue moon (did not end up getting the full list after) but this matchup was basically a race for me to avoid early removal and get creatures early for the ground and pound, in this matchup really wish I had more rabblemasters but that is for a future list

Round 3: 8-Rack 2-1 (GB version)
Very close matchup as ponza does not do well whatsoever with early creature removal and SMALLPOX. Lost first game, top decked lethal when all hope was lost in second game and in third game had very good hand to keep with the tempo and follow my curve, got creature threats out early and he could not come back.

Round 4: Jund 2-0
Blood moon good card

Final notes: light up the stage was a real mvp in the deck and experimental frenzy as a 1 of is really nice to have for big endgame value. If this post gets some popularity I will post a proper 75 and how I would have preferred to play the deck. Gonna go enjoy my new shiny light up the stage promo now. Cheers :D

Captain Marvel was Surprisingly Really Well Done,"I’ve never been one to discriminate genders as different and have been raised my whole life to not do so either. However, in this day and age when that mentality is pushed so much, it can often, more times than not, be more annoying than the oppressive community itself. 

With that in mind, I had zero plans to watch captain marvel and was most likely gonna look at the Wikipedia plot so I knew what atmosphere EndGame would begin with. And then I would’ve watched it on Netflix like 6 months later.

However, my friend had some tickets and practally begged me to come as he didn’t want to go alone. So, as a favour, I decided to go. 

And holy, I was surprised to see there was zero feminist agenda in the movie. The fact that she was a female didn’t really affect the plot at all. She was just a person there doing her job. At first I thought she had zero emotion. But she was really likeable as a protagonist as well, 

All in all, excellent movie. Great acting and plot. Gonna be a blast waiting for EndGame with you guys. 

PS: Always been a DC fan but there’s no denying Marvel’s cinematic universe is superior. If DC follows the exact roadmap, they too, can be successful regardless of big name superheroes or not. If they focus their power onto the lesser known superheroes and make the more known, they, too, can have an Infinity War, cinematically, I know about Infinite Crisis.

Since then, I’ve been developing the thoughts I shared as to how “Justice League” could have been a successful adaption. This is an updated version of the original post. The new content starts in the section titled ""Casting the New League.""

Back when ""Green Lantern"" came out, a question I heard from both comic book fans and general audiences had to do with the casting of Ryan Reynolds. Peers were confused and asked, ""Why isn't he black? I thought Green Lantern was black."" Meanwhile, several fans wondered why DC chose to make the movie about Hal Jordan, instead of John Stewart, a black Green Lantern who had most recently appeared in the hit animated series Justice League. Over and over again, I heard this basic criticism, which isn't really an issue with the film itself, but with the executives and other creatives at Warner Bros. It would've made far more sense to make a Green Lantern movie about the iteration of the character that was most popular at the time. But, executives and screenwriters didn't take that into consideration.

This wouldn't be the first time WB made this kind of mistake. When Justice League came out, I heard a similar complaint related to Cyborg. Even though my generation grew up with the animated series Teen Titans, people were still confused. Many didn't know who the character was, and others didn't know why he was promoted to the Justice League. It was confusing for those who hadn't kept up to date with DC's New 52 reboot of the team.

Even as an avid comic book fan, I was unfamiliar with the film's villain, Steppenwolf. Of course, these aren't huge issues with the story itself. It's not the end of the world if audiences aren't sure who characters are before they see a film. Obviously, Marvel has proven their ability to introduce general audiences to heroes and villains they've never heard of before without alienating them in the process.

But, I want to write this post because it's a fun challenge (sometimes) to think like an executive. Their decisions can boggle our minds, and with such disasters like Justice League or Suicide Squad or Green Lantern, it might be refreshing to think like a *smart* executive. Marvel clearly has a few of those.

The aspects of Justice League that executives tried to engage general audiences just didn't work. Scenes were recolored from Zack Snyder's original darker tone. One scene was literally changed from taking place during night to during the day. Joss Whedon was infamously brought in to reimagine the film that had been shot, and add new scenes. A song was added to the opening titles. WB had several strategies to try and cater to the most general of potential audience members. But it all fell flat.

**A Well-Known Team**

Firstly, if you're going to start a franchise with a roster of superheroes, focus on the strengths. What are the advantages we have as storytellers?

If you're not having solo character films build up to these characters meeting for the first time on screen, that's fine. It's not the end of the world. Even Black Widow and Hawkeye, members of the Avengers, didn't have films to themselves.

However, they at least had appearances in those other films, something DC tried to do with their characters, with Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg showing up in Batman v Superman. Then, with Flash showing up for (literally) one second in Suicide Squad.

People tend to know the big DC heroes, which couldn't have been said for Marvel years ago. This is a strength. This works. People know Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and the Flash. We don't necessarily need a whole lot of build-up aside from this movie.

But, what version of the team do people know best? It's the one from the popular animated series. This should've been the demographic that DC catered to. Most comic book fans are in agreement, DC's animated stuff is gold. People who only grew up with the show and didn't read comics would also be intrigued.

The team is compromised of John Stewart's Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, Martian Manhunter, Batman, Superman, Flash, and Wonder Woman.

Originally, it seems that Cyborg was meant to be a character the theatrical film focused on, with his own arc involving the acceptance of his new, mechanical body. There are hints of this in the finalized theatrical cut, but there's a lot that was skimmed over and reportedly cut out. It's smart to give the story focus on a character audiences don't know about. It can give the movie more heart, and helps us connect better with characters.

Similarly, the character that general audiences might not know much about should be the focus in this version. Martian Manhunter is a convenient fit. This movie could even be from his perspective, the last surviving alien from Mars who has lost all hope and is looking for a new home and family on earth.

While Hawkgirl isn't widely known, she could easily be introduced through Green Lantern, a cosmic police officer who could've met her in the field. This movie needs more than one female superhero in Wonder Woman- the dynamic doesn't feel right with only one woman among four men.

**A Threatening Antagonist**

I grew up with shows like Smallville, where big time villains and other events would be saved for later seasons. After nearly eight years of hype, Zod finally appeared on the show. Then, a few years later, Darkseid appeared in the series finale after a full season of build-up. Nowadays, show runners know they need to give it all they have within the first season to ensure viewership and keep up ratings. In The Flash's first season, we had big name villains make appearances, such as Weather Wizard (in the pilot), Gorilla Grodd, and several others, with the main antagonist being Flash's arch-enemy, Reverse Flash.

In an effort to build anticipation for the Justice League's eventual sequel villain Darkseid, WB settled for a lesser antagonist who would aid the film as a plot device to get the team together. And it did not work in their favor. Consciously giving your heroes a lesser villain should be a red flag. In the case of Justice League, they didn't have time to waste. They needed their big guns.

If they were at all interested in Darkseid, then Darkseid needed to be the main antagonist of this film. Steppenwolf didn't only look like a joke- his lines were thoughtless trash. His actions were just as bland. He is likely one of the worst movie villains of all time.

It's a struggle to imagine how writers pitched Steppenwolf to WB. What was it he had going for him, besides a plug for a future installment? There's really nothing interesting about his character.

In the case of Darkseid, he's Thanos with qualities of both Darth Vader and the Emperor. He's sinister. He's psychological. He's a physical threat, with powers that could stand against every member of the Justice League. He has a memorable comic book design, if the film's character design didn't mess it up. Darkseid makes sense for this movie. Nobody would've minded if they brought in the voice actor from the animated series to voice him. He is right for an origin film, which Geoff Johns clearly knew when he wrote Justice League: Origin, later adapted into an animated film, Justice League: War.

**A Compelling Plot**

The film can still have its foes in the parademons, Darkseid's classic army that he leads. But, let's forget the mother boxes and make the plot more unique than just ""terraform the earth"" like it was just a few years prior in Man of Steel. Instead, maybe Darkseid is after the “anti-life equation” to destroy all life in the universe.

And this time, let's have the villain connect with our main characters, something the actual movie didn't do successfully at all with Steppenwolf. They tried to connect his backstory with the Amazons and Wonder Woman, as well as Aquaman in Atlantis, but it all felt disconnected and muddled.

This time, Darkseid is conquering planet after planet, and Green Lantern, John Stewart, has been following him, but he's on his last resort. In deep space, John meets with the Guardians of Oa, requesting they bring an end to Darkseid, but he's denied. John's jurisdiction remains limited to earth. The Lanterns haven't been able to stop Darkseid, since there's only one Lantern assigned to protect each planet. Now, John calls in a friend, Hawkgirl, also a police officer character of sorts from her own planet.

Meanwhile, Martian Manhunter seeks refuge on earth, and has telepathic visions of Darkseid's coming reign. Soon, this planet will be taken from him too. But, he knows who might be able to help: Superman, the only alien he recognizes, a Kryptonian. He feels comfort in knowing he isn't alone as the last of his kind. He's even inspired by him, longing to be a hero like he is. Manhunter tries to contact Superman telepathically. He eventually goes to Superman in person, who doesn't prejudge him or assume he wants to cause trouble. Superman trusts his word, and shows empathy.

In response, Superman clues Batman in on everything that has happened. Batman is keeping his eye out, and begins investigating for signs of a coming invasion. In case of emergency, he has found another super-powered hero he can call upon, the Flash. Martian Manhunter mentions he has also tried to contact another hero, but hasn't been able to locate her. Not long after, when the parademons make their way to earth, Wonder Woman makes her debut and fights the creatures, with Batman and Flash joining in.

When Darkseid arrives, he's followed by Green Lantern and Hawkgirl, who are then joined by the rest of the soon-to-be team.

Piece by piece, the Justice League comes together.

The actual film didn't feel organic. It felt rushed and unconfident in its own vision, partly because it wasn't actually written by anyone in particular. It was forged together by executives working for a payday. But, there are still ways for them to have done better and consider audiences before telling a story.

**Casting the New League**

Although DC has had some exceptional casting, for the sake of this prompt, I want to add faces to the new characters on the team. I won’t recast the big three (Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman) as this is a theoretical “what if” for a movie taking place within the continuity they establish.

But, I’ll be honest— WB’s attempt at casting a Justice League felt try-hard. It didn’t feel natural. The dynamics between characters felt forced. Ezra Miller as the Flash kicking it with Ray Fisher as Cyborg just ain’t happening, WB. It felt like it was trying to be the Avengers. That might have been part of Joss Whedon’s contribution in reshoots, but I would argue even without his involvement, the team dynamic between characters is weak.

* The Flash AKA Wally West - [*Billy Magnussen*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m45fmeSPQ4I) *(Game Night, The Big Short, Black Mirror’s “USS Callister”)*

This isn’t a recast in the traditional sense. In Justice League, Ezra Miller plays Barry Allen’s Flash. In the animated series, the Flash is based on another character who takes up the mantle after Barry. While the film borrowed heavily from Wally West’s fun and impulsive personality, this is technically a separate character.

You likely recognize Magnussen by now as he’s appeared in a number of films from recent years. He often gets cast in impulsive, arrogant roles. Most importantly, he’s a fun presence and I think he would convey a more natural sensibility than Miller in this part. He could just as easily play Booster Gold, or Lightray, or even the Trickster, if not Wally West. For reference, here is a scene with Wally. I think Magnussen would stay in audiences’ minds. Sooner or later, I’m positive he’ll be cast in a superhero film: [https://youtu.be/Rujnj55ZXmA](https://youtu.be/Rujnj55ZXmA)

Side note: Whenever I discuss JL with someone who isn’t a big DC person and is trying to find something to like about the movie, they usually say, “Flash wasn’t bad, he was kind of fun, right?” The thing is, Miller is an excellent actor. He has played great dramatic roles in “We Need To Talk About Kevin” and “Perks of Being a Wallflower.” I just think he was miscast here.

* Green Lantern AKA John Stewart - [*Mike Colter*](https://www.google.com/search?q=Mike+Colter&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS790US790&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbk57Y2PPgAhVJvKwKHVHwCC8Q_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1210&amp;bih=629) *(Luke Cage)* or [*Andre Holland*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPKIXUQ9nIA) *(Moonlight, Castle Rock)*

John Stewart is a military-type. He’s tough, and he has a strong sense of right and wrong. But, he’s still a good guy. He isn’t all rough edges. He clearly cares about people. If you’ve seen Luke Cage, you’ll know Colter could pull this off. Similarly, I think Holland could bring a relatable sensibility to the role. Here is a scene from the animated series in which John returns to his hometown after becoming a Green Lantern: [https://youtu.be/fevwy0PDKIM](https://youtu.be/fevwy0PDKIM)

* Hawkgirl - [*Rose Leslie*](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS790US790&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=721&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=zgWIXPiHIMvQsAX2iazgBw&amp;q=rose+leslie&amp;oq=rose+leslie&amp;gs_l=img.3...1636.1636..1827...0.0..0.0.0.......1....1..gws-wiz-img.89tIvw5Zxjo) *(Game of Thrones, The Good Fight)*

Finding the right actress for Hawkgirl is like finding the right actress for Wonder Woman. There aren’t that many people who could genuinely pull it off, in my opinion. In the animated series, Hawkgirl was a more distant, stern character, who didn’t open up much. She was a warrior. As the series progressed, she opened up and we started to understand her better. Leslie has portrayed similar roles before, as a warrior-type who has stood her own ground, while also appearing vulnerable later on. This is a scene in which Hawkgirl betrays her own people to reunite with the League: [https://youtu.be/DtjZ0j2nS2g](https://youtu.be/DtjZ0j2nS2g)

* Martian Manhunter - [*Sterling K. Brown*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3bN2an7boE) *(This Is Us, Black Panther)*

As the heart of the film, Martian Manhunter needs to be portrayed by an actor with deep emotional awareness and range. Sterling Brown has shown his ability to do this on This Is Us. Likewise, Martian Manhunter’s best depictions have not made him out to be some distant alien being. Instead, he reminds others of what it means to be human. Here is a scene of Manhunter in the animated series: [https://youtu.be/QZV4EL5wjC4](https://youtu.be/QZV4EL5wjC4)

**Setting the Stage for Sequels**

There are so many routes a Justice League trilogy could go in. If the first film tackles Darkseid as the big bad, a character on par with Thanos, the sequels are left with a challenge. They have to one-up whatever came before. We’ve seen superhero movies struggle with this in some regards. Justice League didn’t do a good job “one-upping” Zod in my opinion, who seemed to be a much worse threat than Steppenwolf, both of whom failed to accomplish the same thing in trying to turn earth into their home worlds.

A Justice League sequel could focus on a new character and establish their backstory as a threat, similar to Silver Surfer in the Fantastic Four sequel, or the animated Justice League direct-to-video movie, “Throne of Atlantis” which features Aquaman and the invasion of Ocean Master’s army. However, there are a dozen other more interesting ways to take this.

When The Avengers came out, people saw the post-credits scene and wondered “who is that purple guy?” In retrospect, I think Marvel missed out the first time they revealed Thanos. He was since developed into a bigger threat in cameos, but his initial appearance did not take full advantage of the opportunity. Audiences need to know what’s going on, and in this case, they had no idea what was happening.

Justice League did something kind of smart in this regard. We see Lex Luthor meeting with Deathstroke in the post-credits, and audiences generally knew what was happening. Unfortunately, I don’t think they cared. Even I felt indifferent to the idea of the Legion of Doom in the way it was presented.

An after credits scene has to do more than make audiences curious. It has to amp them up for what comes next. Avengers: Infinity War and Captain Marvel, among other Marvel films, did a great job at this.

**Emerald Twilight**

In the 90s, writers took a risk in bringing Green Lantern Hal Jordan to the dark side. Personally, I think this is one of the most underrated events in DC history. One might compare it to the Phoenix Saga in X-Men, but I honestly think it’s far more of an interesting ride. There’s a lot of good material, and there’s potential for this to be a great inspiration for a film. More on that arc here, which would have to be altered quite a bit from the comics as there’s an extensive backstory: [https://youtu.be/fEb-OWzJ-HU](https://youtu.be/fEb-OWzJ-HU)

As this first Justice League installment acts as our introduction to Green Lantern and the Green Lantern Corps, an intergalactic police force, I think a sequel loans itself for further exploration. Like fans of the comics know, John Stewart is not the first Green Lantern of earth in the comics. Before Stewart became the Green Lantern of Sector 2814, Hal Jordan wore the ring (previously portrayed by Ryan Reynolds in the infamously lackluster origin movie).

Throughout this new version of “Justice League,” it can be mentioned there was another Lantern before John. It is said that Jordan died on a mission, and it’s assumed that his ring later went to Stewart, as that is the process when new Lanterns are chosen. But, the Guardians are keeping something a secret. They are not certain what happened to Jordan, but they have their suspicions that he died at the hands of the sinister Parallax. However, his ring was never recovered, and so the Guardians sent a new ring to find a replacement Lantern, which found John Stewart after he returned home from the war.

In the after credits, John Stewart’s ring begins to blink light, signaling an alert from Oa. Returning to the planet, John is shocked. It’s been decimated. Checking security footage, John watches the Lantern Corps struggle to defend their planet, but it’s from another Lantern: Hal Jordan. John can’t believe it. The power it would take to defeat an entire planet of Lanterns and Guardians is incomprehensible to him.

Without the Guardians, John will have to reunite the League to take on the world-conquering threat of the original Green Lantern, who they don’t realize is possessed by Parallax.

Audiences are surprised, and intrigue is built for a future installment. It’s hyped that there might even be some potential character deaths. Maybe Hawkgirl, John’s love interest in the animated series, has to face her demise. I think that would be an especially emotional death for John, who would carry a lot of the heart of this film. I think Hal would likely meet his end as well, possibly as a sacrifice of redemption to ultimately stop Parallax.

Side note: James Marsden would kill it as a disgruntled, hell-bent Hal Jordan.

**Crisis on Two Earths**

To close out a trilogy of films, a finale has to be epic. Similar to the Parallax storyline, “Crisis on Infinite Earths” utilizes ideas that are absent in Avengers storylines.

It’s likely you’re aware of DC’s multiverse, as it’s been adapted a bit in The Flash TV show and in an awesome animated film a couple years ago written by Dwayne McDuffie. This version of the story will be more closely based on that animated movie (which I’d strongly recommend checking out if you aren’t familiar).

Here’s a trailer that sums up the film’s plot pretty well: [https://youtu.be/FNlYtU\_x-dI](https://youtu.be/FNlYtU_x-dI)

In short, an alternate universe version of the League who are super villains instead of heroes, seek to conquer their earth, while Owlman wants to destroy the multiverse altogether. I think this is the best way to “one-up” all the threats that came before: for the antagonists to try and destroy every reality as we know it. The stakes don’t get any higher than that. The second season of The Flash did something similar, as the writers realized the villain Zoom had to be even more sinister than the first season’s Reverse Flash.

Meanwhile, on this alternate earth, Martian Manhunter connects with a fellow martian romantically. Once again, he plays a big part as the film’s heart.

[It would be a bittersweet ending for the trilogy to conclude in a similar way to the animated adaption.](https://youtu.be/cv8mZza4XMc) The film closes out with the League having a few character moments, reminiscing with one another on their adventures. Batman and Superman go to the Watchtower where they find new recruits waiting to meet the League. New members could include Cyborg and Aquaman (both of whom I had first shut out), along with Shazam, Black Canary, and Huntress, all portrayed by their “DCEU” actors and actresses. Having new heroes join the team would serve as an almost tribute to the potentially fallen Hawkgirl.

Of course, this leaves the franchise open to even more sequels. But, similar to how Avengers: Endgame presumably is the start of a whole new era in the MCU, this ending allows for a new era as well in the DCU.

Maybe the next film could draw inspiration from the animated “Justice League: Doom,” which pits immortal tyrant Vandal Savage and the Legion of Doom against the League. Or, it can team the League up with the Legion of Superheroes, a group of heroes from the 30th Century to stop the Fatal Five. Or, it could bring Brainiac into the game and follow the Geoff Johns story arc. There are countless ways to do a fun, memorable Justice League movie. But first and foremost, it has to stand out and leave an impact on audiences. It has to make an impression.",fixingmovies,15,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/b1pfnu/rethinking_justice_league_appealing_to_general/,DC,tiMartyn,b1pfnu,/r/fixingmovies/comments/b1pfnu/rethinking_justice_league_appealing_to_general/,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/b1pfnu/rethinking_justice_league_appealing_to_general/,2,2019-03-16
Update: ZeroRanger Single Weapon 1CC (Low%) Progression Thread.,"Hey Reddit! I decided to make a thread archiving my progress on clearing a Low% 1CC of ZeroRanger on the Shmup forums, and since my last video here got positive feedback, I decided to share the link here as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is Low%?  

Low% refers to completing the game and finishing the final boss, while also collecting and using the bear minimum amount of upgrades to do so. In this instance, it would mean collecting Sword or Drill in order to trigger endgame, but only using Single Fire.

Rubble everywhere. My endgame turned out to be a failure...,"I know i should've prepared for this, but I wasn't. So many things prevented me from doing so...

Anyway, I'm here to vent out and cry because for the past two days I have felt like shit on shit cake.

I was rejected from MIT. My dream school. Ever since I was in eighth grade,  I was a horrible student. I got B's on my best day. But when my friends started attending national competitions and visited MIT, i got super motivated and vowed to get into MIT. Ever since then, I started working as hard as I possibly can to the point where my head just couldn't take it anymore; my head started to feel burnt out. One of my friends gave me an MIT hat as a gift and I took that hat and slept next to it throughout these 4 years to remind myself of the endgame. So that I wouldn't get frustrated over bad grades on a single test, over not scoring what I wanted on the AMC test, etc. My vision was very clear: I wanted to go to MIT. At this point, I became the ""underdog"" of my class.

December 15,2018: I got deferred while all of my friends got accepted. I was jealous but also happy for them, but I kept thinking to myself ""I just have to keep fighting for a little while longer"". Since that day, I started a countdown clock to March 14,2019: The Endgame. 

March 14,2019: All throughout this week I had been having anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns but I always pushed through, praying to get in. March 14 was the longest day of my life. I even felt nauseated at one point. 1.5 hours before decisions were released I was staring at my countdown clock in tears of anxiety. But the thing is, this day was a very good one: I looooooooooooooooove the MCU and when the new Endgame trailer came out, I saw it as a sign. Before this day, I had also been accepted to Georgia Tech and George Mason, so I felt like I had huge momentum coming into this. Besides the endgame trailer coming out, i also got an email from GT saying that I got a scholarship and that they would be paying my trip to their open house. This sequence of events led to really buy into the idea that I was going to get into MIT and that this would be the best day of my life. 

30 minutes before decisions were posted: I started watching the Avengers: Endgame trailer on repeat throughout these entire 30 minutes and when 19 seconds were left on the clock, I clicked play on the trailer on the part where the ""Avenger Endgame"" logo appears. 

6:28 PM: ""I am very sorry to tell you that you are not admitted to the MIT Class of 2023."" My dream... had just been shattered before my eyes. I am still feeling extremely depressed and embarrassed. Throughout these years exclaimed that I wanted to go to MIT to my friends and classmates, so when I read the rejection I felt extremely disappointed in myself and embarrassed out of existence. And I am still feeling like this today. Out the 6 students in my calc 3 class, I am the only one who got rejected. On monday, I have to walk into a classroom full of people who did what I set out to do and vowed to do almost every day to my friends, family and classmates. My world has been shattered. Destroyed. Annihilated. And I give up. Dont get me wrong: I am very very very very happy about Georgia Tech, but it stupidly horrible to be in the most advanced math class in my school's history and be the only student who didn't get in, despite all of my efforts and all the support I got. Everything I have built, has been destroyed. My endgame...resulted in failure. And there is no time travel, no redemption...there is nothing I can do to fix this. I have never been this depressed before. I am trying to move on, but as long as I am in that class, i dont think I will be able to.

[Endgame] Talos and the Snap,"This post will contain a spoiler for Captain Marvel.

So we learn in Captain Marvel that [Talos is not actually a villain, but a refugee simply trying to get his family and friends to a safe planet](#spoiler)

When Captain Marvel shows up at the Avengers HQ, she is clearly distressed. While this is likely due to seeing the effects of the snap throughout the universe, I think that she likely witnessed Talos, Soren, and their Daughter die from the snap along with receiving Fury’s pager.

one thing I love from the trailer,"is the emphasis on Nat and Clint's friendship. In Avengers (2012) Nat states that she owe's Clint a debt, that he saved her, gave her another chance. it seem's in Endgame, Nat is going to save Clint, give him another chance, maybe even repay his debt that she feels she still owes him.

[Manga Spoilers] The Coordinate and Endgame,"Here's something I've been pondering lately. Can the Coordinate control titan shifters?

I think the answer is no. When Eren ordered the titans to attack Dina none of the other shifters acted upon his command, although they did sense that a command was given. We also know that some of the Founder's abilities, namely memory alteration, have no effect on Eldians like those in the Ackerman clan. This has one interesting implication for endgame. It means that if Eren intends to use the Coordinate to remove the Eldian ability to become titans the command should not effect Eren or the other shifters, including Zeke. It also means that Eldians could potentially still be born with shifter abilities after a shifter dies, which is not an ideal situation for either side.

What this would mean for endgame is that touching Zeke is only phase one of Eren's plan. It'd disarm Zeke of his mindless army, but then Eren would still have to deal with one royally pissed off monkey. 

I imagine Isayama will make it so Eren's command also undoes the anti-war vow. The reason I think he'd do this, assuming my theory is correct, is because it'd create incentive for Zeke to eat Eren. If Eren destroys the vow then Zeke would no longer need a non-royal he can't control to access the Coordinate, he could just eat Eren himself, and that would create a more exciting final battle where both sides have something to gain and something to lose.

On a related note, I don't think it's possible for the Coordinate to destroy itself with the power of the Founding titan alone. If it could then the 145th King probably would have just done that in order to stop his people from fighting over titan powers. Maybe having all the titans together in one body would allow Eren to do something about that. In any case, I think it'd make for a much more exciting conclusion than Eren touches Zeke and instantly wins.

Brie Larson's performance was actually one of the main reasons why I love Captain Marvel,"We all know about the controversy surrounding this film, with a lot of harsh criticism going towards Brie Larson whether there are haters that just throw shade for no reason other than out of being a misogynist or people that didn't mind the movie but found her dull compared to her costars Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn. 

But I personally thought her acting was completely fine, she actually did a fine job in making me care about the character. She certainly didn't lack range, she had moments where I thought she was quite charismatic and she caught my attention in wanting to see more of Captain Marvel in the future even after Endgame.

Whether or not you might not agree, you have to give Larson credit for doing the best she could with a character who isn't easy to play. Especially when you look at how hard she committed in bringing this role to life, all of those videos of her training and studying her character while reading comics that center on Carol Danvers were very inspiring.

How Audio46 sells so many Campfire Andromedas,"Alright. I've been an audiophile for long enough. After some research it's time to reach somewhere near endgame (at least for the time being), which I thought were either going to be the ie800s or Xelentos for me. 

I walk into audio46. 

""Hey there. Can I try the xelentos?""

""Sure"", the employee replies. 

A minute later, the employee brings an open box of the beyers. She also shoves an unassuming green little box right next to it.  

""'Excuse me, what's this?""

""Andromedas. People like them.""

Interesting. Anyways, I put the Xelentos and I roll through some tracks.

""They seem a bit warm for my tastes.""

""Is that so?""

The employee slowly pokes the Andromedas towards my direction.

 ""Uh... ok, anyways can I get the ie800s with the 2.5mm cable?""

""Of course.""

Before she goes gets the senns she opens the box for the Andromedas. I stare at them. 

""Here you go!""

The employee gives me the Senns. She also takes the Andromedas out. 

Wow Knowledge Zenith really did copy the design. 

""Uh... what are you doing?"", I ask. 

She replies back with a suspicious smile. 

I try the Senns. I like them a lot. I take them out and... 

Well the Andromedas are just sitting there on the table. Cable unwrapped and ready to go. 

I put the Andromedas in and hit play and...

Goddamnit. I much prefer them to the other two. 

I slowly take the Andromedas out.

""Do you guys do this on purpose?""

The entire store Lmfaos. 

""What's your best selling IEMs at this store?""

The employee replies: ""Andromedas"".

I have played 100 hours of Anthem. I have 1 Legendary (Game Design discussion),"I am not here to rage. I want to talk about the design of this game and what I think is the reason why Bioware are ""holding back"" on the drops. And why it's the worst thing they could be doing with this game. The loot, and therefore by extension the game, is poorly designed.  


The simple fact is that the story is lacklustre, but it serves the purpose of introducing the player to the world and characters. As such the ""meat"" of the game exists in endgame. Especially with this intended to be a live service game.  


Games are based on reward structures. This is the genius behind loot driving games and why their design is ideal for live service games. It provides an endless treadmill of rewards to keep the player engaged. There's always something for the player to get or hunt. There's always some reward the player can be given.  


This means that **Operant Conditioning** is the driving force behind loot driven games. The player learns to associate playing the game with rewards. This drives the player to continue playing the game. Play game = good thing happens.  


However the sparsity of rewards poses a problem. If the player is actively seeking rewards and fails to get them. This represents a punishment. And this also falls in line with operant conditioning. It means that players learn to associate playing Anthem with a punishment. And I believe that this is why there appear to be so much animosity in this subreddit and in the conversation around the game in general.  


Anthem is a game that actively punishes the people that play it.  


I personally believe that Anthem is an incomplete game. This is not a criticism. It's just a law of Game Dev ""Eventual, you must ship"". You can't just dev forever and if shipment day comes and your game is incomplete. You need to ship an incomplete game. I mean, we all love The Witcher 3 right. But by CD Projekt Red's own admission, that game was not finished. Whole features that were meant to be delivered were completely absent. That's just games.  


But now Bioware are in possession of a game that they need to support in the long term that is incomplete, and in order to deliver a solid game. They are now going to have to prioritize. They are going to need to decide what needs love and what needs to be triaged. And that will likely require some more ""production time"" before dev can recommence in earnest. So they needed a treadmill, a time sync to keep players going until those releases are ready. And this is why I believe the loot drops are so sparse. I believe that they think that it is sufficient for players to chase Legendaries and they want that chase to last until the next big content drop.  


But the problem is that this runs counter to the game's design and to operant conditioning in general. Due to the guaranteed masterwork drops of strongholds. Once A player reaches endgame. They can build a masterwork Javelin in a day. However after that the player's ""*reward*"" is Legendary drops. And any time the player doesn't receive a Legendary drop, they view this as a *punishment*.  


At this stage, most people I know only log in to run their contracts maybe a stronghold to see if they get any good drops. Outside of that, they have no interest in playing the game because they have learned to associate playing Anthem with a punishment. And that's not them being toxic or problematic. That view is baked into the very design of the game. Anthem has taught them to view it that way.  


It has gone: This is what you should care about. But if you play the game, it will not give you what you care about. Anthem is conditioning it's playerbase to not want to play the game.  


The thing is, before we had inscriptions that had nothing to do with the item it was found on. But no-one would care about that if drops were regular. In fact, that enables you to really go all out min-maxing builds. Instead,Anthem has ignored some of the founding principles of game design. And I think it's done so because it didn't have the time to think about those decisions once it realised that it had to meet a deadline.  


But the sad fact is, if someone can play your game for 100 hours and get only 1 reward. Your system is broken. Fundamentally. Not only will your game fail to  grow if it punishes players. but it will eventually push the existing ones away.  


Again, there's no anger here.

"(Spoilers Extended) This sub, and this community in general, could be better at talking about the show.","It's cool if you downvote me, cuz I'd probably downvote me too. But at least hear me out. I'm not saying that you have to like the show. It's perfectly alright to look at all the show's faults, and there are *quite a few lol*, and come away saying that she show is bad or not for you or whatever. Hell, I really like the show, and even still I wouldn't say that the show is a faithful adaptation of *A Song of Ice and Fire*. I'd say it reinterprets the books to tell a TV version with the same aesthetic and a large portion of the total ensemble, but it largely omits the later themes and some of the details that really make the last two books. I like it for what it is (I like dragons, what can I say), but even if the first four seasons and the endgame are the same as the books plot-wise, I would say it's a very different beast than the books. And I wouldn't disagree that even without an ending, which in my personal opinion does severely diminish the books so far, *A Song of Ice and Fire* is far and away the superior telling of the tale. 

Alright? It's cool if you don't like the show. ***IT'S COOL IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE SHOW***. I feel like I need to reiterate that otherwise someone will call me a filthy show-apologist (show-pologist?). So I'll say it again. It's cool if you like the show. 

But either way, call me a pleb and a casual and not a real fan, tell me that you're so much smarter and better than me, it doesn't change the fact that this community could be better about talking about the show. You'd probably be right in all those things, but my point still stands. We could be better about talking about the show. What do I mean? Well, let's use an example: Varys.

There's a recent post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/b1tt84/spoilers_extended_grampa_varys/) talking about how strange it is to see Varys go all ""for thre good of the realm"" compared to how he is in the books. It's a perfectly fine observation, and I think there's an interesting conversation to be had there. Are we gonna have it? Probably not. I guess it's just easier to go ""DAE think DnD are stupid and the show is bad?"" then ask why these changes happen. 

So why do I think Varys turned out so much weaker in the show than in the books. Well, it's because of Aegon! In the books, Varys has spent 20 years or so plotting to put this kid on the Iron Throne. Everything he's done, it's to put Aegon on the Iron Throne. 

But the show had to toss out Aegon. Why? ~~Because they suck. Fucking DnD, ruining everything~~. Because *Aegon is by design a complete fucking asspull*. He's this eleventh hour guy who's chilled on a boat for the entire story before coming in with a giant army and maybe probably taking the throne possibly. He's supposed to steal the thunder of the real exiled Targaryen and the real hidden son of Rhaegar with the claim to the Throne. How the fuck do you adapt that? Do we really expect audiences to care about him? Compared to Cersei, who'd inevitably replace him in the show? Compared to Tywin, the closest thing the First Act has to a big bad? Aegon is set to be as important to the story as Joffrey and Cersei and Ned and Tyrion and *holy shit he's gonna sit on the Iron Throne*. And we expect audiences to buy this? You'd have to get rid of Cersei and Jaime for who? Aegon and Jon Connington? No,
I don't think so. He'd feel like an ass-pull, like he did to me when I first read *A Dance with Dragons*. It'd take more balls than exists in all of Hollywood to green-light that kind of lunatic twist in what turned out to be HBO's big money-maker.

But the worst part, the part that ensured that there was no way Aegon could be included, is that *Aegon does jack-fucking-shit*. Yeah yeah, he gets the Golden Company to invade ahead of schedule and plans to lead the battle against Mace the Ace, but c'mon. Aegon's conquest of the Iron Throne is on Jon and Varys, not Aegon's martial prowess or tactical skill. And even then, all of this is set to happen in *Winds*. We've been waiting for George to tell us how super important Aegon is *for NINE. FUCKING. YEARS!* The show's entire runtime fits between *Dance* and *Winds*. So what should the show do? Go on hiatus until the heat death of the universe, which is apparently how long George intends to keep us waiting? No. *The Show must go on.* That's unreasonable to ask. So, the showrunners decided on the most logical thing to do: Cut Aegon entirely and have Cersei take his role opposing Daenerys when she finally lands in Westeros.

Now, this decision obviously has massive ramifications of the story. First of all, you need at least some level of competence from Cersei if she's to hold the Throne that long. So while the books have her as a hot mess, the show wrote her as more cunning (and gave her bullshit-levels of luck). Also, Dany is a lot less morally ambiguous when she's up against Cersei fucking Lannister. She can't just burn Cursei with her dragons, not if you want the conflict to be serious. So she needs to park her dragon-butt on Dragonstone, and that undermines her being dark or a villain or whatever, because if that was the case she'd *burn Cersei alive*. I get that her burning the Tarlys is supposed to make us go ""oH sHiT sHe'S gOiNg MaD"" or whatever, but I wasn't feeling it. Because if you're dumb enough to ally with Cersei fucking Lannister, I don't feel sorry for you when the dragon bites you in the ass. But Aegon? Why wouldn't you ally with this ""Perfect Prince""^^tm. All of these guys allying with Aegon against the Lannisters makes perfect sense. And Dany squashing Aegon in a bloody war after Westeros has already suffered so much definitely makes her really dark, making her turn away from the Throne and towards the light much more satisfying. But without George releasing the books in a timely manner, you have to go with this pale imitation.

And then we come to Varys. If you remove Aegon, Varys' main goal since before the story proper even starts, then you have to play him straight. You have to take him at his word. What else is there? He can't back Viserys,. *No one* backs Viserys. You have to have him be exactly what he appears to be, flitting from ruler to ruler trying to find the best one to back. You have to, even though that's the exact opposite of who he is in the books. *That's* why Varys feels kinda off in the show. Not because everyone in the show is stupid DnD = satan, but because there are perils to adapting a story this sprawling and, most importantly, this *unfinished*. 

Saying ""Varys is bad because DnD sux"" is not nearly as interesting as looking at why the writers would write him like that. And that's not to say that this excuses the writers for their mistakes, or that there are similar excuses for the other various weaknesses of the show. Sansa marrying Ramsay was particularly egregious. ~~I mean, *seriously*! You take this character who has had almost *ZERO* agency for the. ENTIRE. Book. And she finally goes somewhere where she isn't constantly fearing for her life, where she can learn how to play the Game of Thrones, watch the best player alive do his stuff, and get some real leadership experience manipulating things from the background. She gets to go through Dany's and Jon's arcs in *Dance*, proved herself a proper leader to be taken seriously, and become a legitimate contender for the ultimate victor of the Game. And you FUCK IT UP by stripping her of all that agency and growth and having her get raped by fucking Ramsay. That was offensively bad, and the ""trauma = ice-queen badassery"" of seasons 6 and 7 don't count. Turning Sansa into Cersei and Littlefinger doesn't count. I don't even *like* Sansa and even I can admit that what made Sansa interesting was how she could go through all that bullshit while not becoming a horrible person like Cersei and Littlefinger. We're not supposed to want her to become some amoral, heartless monster, goddammit. *Courtesy is a lady's armor*, it's not that fucking hard! There's no excuse for not getting that right!!~~

Sorry. Sorry. I got side tracked. But my main point is that you can see how certain choices were made regarding what parts of ASOIAF got adapted practically word-for-word and which parts were changed. Look at Dorne. Dorne sucked in the show, unequivocally, but *why does it suck*? Or rather, why would the showrunners write it sucking? Because without Aegon, Dorne doesn't really go anywhere. You have to keep it, because Oberyn Martell died and there's no way Dorne just goes all ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ over their beloved Prince getting his head caved in by the same guy who did it to their Princess all those years ago. Literally, that's among the major reasons why the five-year-gap was scrapped. Because you needed to see Dorne's immediate reaction to their Prince's death.

&gt;Obara touched her whip. ""Thousands are crossing the sands afoot to climb the Boneway, so they may help Ellaria bring my father home. The septs are packed to bursting, and the red priests have lit their temple fires. In the pillow houses women are coupling with every man who comes to them, and refusing any coin. In Sunspear, on the Broken Arm, along the Greenblood, in the mountains, out in the deep sand, everywhere, everywhere, women tear their hair and men cry out in rage. The same question is heard on every tongue—what will Doran do? What will his brother do to avenge our murdered prince?"" She moved closer to the captain. ""And you say, he does not wish to be disturbed!""

&gt;*A Feast for Crows* 
&gt;* The Captain of the Guards

But Aegon is the catharsis of all of that dithering on Doran's part. All that ""oh man, do I avenge my dead sister even though it risks the lives of all my people, even though we're horribly outmatched?"" angst pays off with the boy claiming to be Elia's dead son calling on Dornish spears to help him win his Throne and avenge his ""mother""'s death by casting the LAnnisters down for good. Without Aegon, you're stuck in this limbo where you *have* to have Dorne in the story, but there's no way to pay it off. And while that doesn't excuse the horrible writing of the Dornish storyline, I think it explains it fairly well. 

Or take Stannis - and I'm basically asking one of you to burn down my house now, lol - and his infamous death in Season 5. Why have that? Why change it to Jon and Sansa fighting the Boltons instead? Probably because they saw that the end result was pretty similar - Jon as King in the North, Sansa taking the Knights of the Vale to Winterfell and killing Baelish there, Stannis dying unappreciated, and just picked the straightest and most crowd-pleasingest path there. What actually happens in the books? Hell if I know, but if I had to wager a guess, I'd say Stannis smashes the Boltons but doesn't get Rickon, and he comes into conflict with Jon, who uses Robb's will as a pretext to bring the Wildlings South post-resurrection. Naturally, the Northern Lords choose the Young Wolf's chosen heir over whichever schlub Stannis taps to become Warden of the North, and Stannis has to retreat, either to Dragonstone or the Nightfort. Then Stannis dies, either by Dany if he went to Dragonstone or the Others when the Wall comes down if he went to the Nightfort. But that's not the heroic, *""Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding!!!""* type of closer that DnD wanted, so they condensed it, giving the whole ""rallying the North and defeating the Boltons"" arc to Jon instead. I mean, as long as you get to the same end positions for the characters, who cares about the rest^^/s. 
Again, this doesn't make the writing good, just tries to examine the adaptation process from an angle other than ""DnD want to actively ruin the things you like"". 

Hell, people complain *a lot* about the way the show squeezes *A Feast for Crows* and *A Dance with Dragons* together instead of giving them the same treatments as the first three books. And yeah, I don't think they nailed it, but there's something you're missing. **It's damned impossible to adapt *A Feast for Crows* and *A Dance with Dragons*!** Like, whatever you think of those books, and I like them a lot, they're arduous, slowly paced, and *weird*. How the actual fuck do you adapt those into one straight show? You can't do one season for *Feast* and one for *Dance*. You really think anyone would stand for ""you wanna know what happens next for Tyrion, Jon, and Dany etc...? To fucking bad, dorkweed! Here's some more Iron Islands stuff that you all totally loved and this totally new place with eleventy bazillion new characters! Oh, and want to see Brienne travel the Riverlands? Cuz there's seven thousand chapters worth of material""? Forget adapting Aegon, *that's* the ballsy-est thing ever. So do you go with a ""boiled leather"" or *A Feast with Dragons* or some other kind of combined reading? The show *kinda* did that, but the problem is that means stretching each book over the entirety of the length of you adaptation of this combined reading. And there's now way the like four or five Dornish chapters or the five Ironborn chapters in Feast last for *two or more* seasons. It's unreasonable, especially since Dorne and the Iron Islands are about to become super fucking important with Euron and Aegon replacing the Lannisters and Tyrells as major figures in the story. And again, this is all leading up to a climax that we've been waiting *NINE. FUCKING. YEARS* for! That's a ridiculous situation. So, while again this doesn't at all excuse sloppy writing, it contextualizes those mistakes. It explains their decision to condense those books and narrow the story. Incidentally, that's also the main reason they're finishing before George.

That's far from an exhaustive list or even a thorough analysis of those examples. Most of you are capable of much better, I'm sure. But I dunno... doesn't the usual circlejerk get old? Don't you get tired of ""the show sux lol""? Isn't it more interesting to look at the show with the same analytical eye that makes the books more than just another fun fantasy romp but with murder? Doesn't seriously looking at the process of translating such a sprawling, strange, and most importantly *unfinished* book series to television give you a better insight into why the show gets some stuff wrong and also a greater appreciation for what it gets right? I'm not asking you to like the show or praise it or even be silent about things you don't like. Just be as good as this community can be instead of just another fandom bitterly circlejerking because a more popular, ""impure"" version exists and gets all the attention from the casuals etc... 

Because honestly? That's how it comes across sometimes.

aaand... /rant

**TL;DR Shit on the show if that's your jam, but I find those kinds of threads a lot less interesting that what this community is capable of, and they don't show us at our best. They certainly aren't what makes me come here. We could stand to put more effort into how we criticize the show. We'd get more out of it that way.**",asoiaf,277,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/b21p36/spoilers_extended_this_sub_and_this_community_in/,,WootGorilla,b21p36,/r/asoiaf/comments/b21p36/spoilers_extended_this_sub_and_this_community_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/b21p36/spoilers_extended_this_sub_and_this_community_in/,267,2019-03-17

I love the moment to moment gameplay but the end game is broken.,"The core concept, flying, moment to moment gameplay, combos and environment are incredible. Very original and I also loved the campaign, stories and characters. 

This is such a shame as the end game is a complete mess. 

- Quick play is broken
- Strongholds are broken (being put in at boss stage)
- Loot is still broken (even after the latest patch there’s very little time v reward or ability to min/max)
- Damage scaling is broken (looking at you GM2) and not helped by health bug. 
- Few real incentives to play endgame (e.g. no armour sets to chase from strongholds)
- Loading screens for the most menial tasks (looking at you forge) which really starts to annoy in end game when you use them more. 
- the transport to team mechanic is still really annoying, especially when you want to kill trash mobs on route to stronghold bosses. 
- respawning - load screen - miles away from team. Why can’t I just stand up again where I am. 
- Glitches. Bugs. Everywhere you turn. 

I love this game but I’m done for now. There’s a lot of work to be done here and that’s before any new content drops. I really hope BioWare pull it off. 

Good luck out there freelancers. See you on the other side hopefully!",AnthemTheGame,177,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b23wex/i_love_the_moment_to_moment_gameplay_but_the_end/,Discussion,Taxman200,b23wex,/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b23wex/i_love_the_moment_to_moment_gameplay_but_the_end/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b23wex/i_love_the_moment_to_moment_gameplay_but_the_end/,38,2019-03-17

In order to get these bosses to spawn, you have to start elder's influence which spawn after you shaper's influence in tier 6, the elder will spawn in interrupting shaper. Elder Guardians spawn when u get a lot of elder's influence in your atlas. 

**WARNING:** Elder guardian will de-spawn after u complete 20 maps, but you kill any elder guardian it'll reset the counter.

Normal. These boss are typically easier compare to shaper's guardian, will be a lot easier if you spawn them in white tier. If you build can't really kill them then just ask for experience player to help you kill them off.

#11. Restore Cavas' Memory

***NEW CONTENT! Will update soon ...***

#12. Complete Shaper Strongholds

After meeting the Shaper got disturb by the Elder, 4 [Shaper's Stronghold](http://webcdn.pathofexile.com/public/news/2018-08-24/ShaperStronghold.png) will appear over few maps. A map that contains a Shaper's Stronghold will be permanently Shaper-influenced until cleared by you, it can't be take over by elder influences either. Killing the map boss that contain the stronghold will drop few valuable reward such as Chisels, Sextants, Unique Items (including ones that would normally be restricted to leagues) and various Shaper Rare items.

There are few rules for shaper stronghold to spawn:

 * the map must have shaper influences

 * shaper influence has to be naturally spawn, which means ping-pong strategy can't cause it to spawn

 * can have maximum to 2 shaper stronghold to spawn on atlas, well except the starting(4)

[***Karvarousku*** *made a guide video on how to make use of shaper stronghold such as maintain elder influence globe permanently*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbVVGyfa47Q) 

Normal. 20 is actually a small number so can be done within a month.

This is one of the end game boss, you'll need 4 different parts of [sacrifice fragments](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Apex_of_Sacrifice) put into a map device then only can access her domain. Atziri could be a hard fight, but the fragments is kinda easy and cheap to get. If your build can't handle this boss just ask an experience player to help kill it.

#14. Complete these Encounters I

* [**Doedre the Defiler**](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Doedre+the+Defiler) - Tier6 Sepulchre Map, this Doedre boss will summon 3 curse giant-stone-totem around her and start screaming dealing chaos(?) damage 360°, you need to hide behind the totem to avoid that deadly scream from her. But to do this challenge, you need to down her life to low then wait her to scream only kill her.

 ***PSA:*** *[Standing on treasure pile](https://old.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/64jspa/til_treasure_pile_in_vault_map_does_boost_your/) will increase your damage by  50% More ;)*

* [**Stonebeak, Battle Fowl**](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Stonebeak%2C+Battle+Fowl) and [**Gnar, Eater of Carrion**](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Gnar%2C+Eater+of+Carrion) - Tier9 Canyon Map, these boss will enrage whenever one of them dies. To do this challenge you have get both and low hp at the same time, then kill them both together at the same time, if possible also try kite Gnar closer to Stonebeak for easier kill.

To do this challenge try to do in twin map for more spawning of it's minion, first lower the boss life then let it summon it's minion, when is enough amount of minion then only kite out OR single target the boss killing it.

Normal, these challenges are pretty straight forward but some of it kinda tricky, just make the boss fight even more harder to challenge. If can't do this just try to ask experienced players for help, then should be easy to complete this.

#15. Complete Memories II

Easy. Fragmented memories spawn in every instance start from act1, 100 is not a big number so should be easy to complete it within a week.

***NEW CONTENT! Will update soon ...***

#18. Synthesise Items

***NEW CONTENT! Will update soon ...***

Going an unidentified rare map is kinda risky but high reward, do ounce per tier. You can obtain unidentified rare map buy doing the map vendor recipe which also effect the rarity too, etc: vendor 3 same rare map you'll get +1 tier rare map. If your build can't deal most of the map mod then just party up with other people OR invite experienced players to help your Blind Map.

Normal. Surprisingly they make this challenge easier from doing all(16) last league, to only 10 this league .. well thanks GGG! =D

#20. Achieve Ascension

[**PoELAB**](https://www.poelab.com/) is a good resource to check whether today is a short/safe layout to be run or not. Also try install [**LabCompass**](https://www.poelab.com/lab-compass/) for more convenient, is a MUST tools for labyrinth camper! Here's are the locations for each trial to obtain before able to enter certain difficulty labyrinth:

#21. Complete Memories III

***NEW CONTENT! Will update soon ...***

#22. Complete these Encounters II

* **40 Breaches** You'll start encounter breaches in end game maps.

* **40 Abysses** You'll start encounter abysses in Act 6 and onward.

This [table](https://i.imgur.com/fM8QImw.jpg) will help you understand more about essence tiers.

***OVERALL:*** Normal. Mostly are just normal grind, not much RNG needed.

#23. Connect Memories to Rewards

Normal. Maximum amount of memory rewards to spawn in memory map is **20**, each time u open a fracture memory in memory nexus there's a chance to spawn a new memory reward in ur memory map as long it doesn't reach the limit yet. Also memory reward won't goes away until u complete them, so try clear as much as you can to find different type of memory reward to complete this challenge.

#24. Defeat the Syndicate Mastermind (36/40)

Hard. With the new spawn rate is still very hard to fill up the knowledge bar even for the mastermind. Will update this again if they decided to make some change for betrayal mechanic, for now just skip this if you're not chasing 40/40.

#25. Complete Globally Modified Memories

Normal. Keep reach out those [Distant Memory](https://i.imgur.com/DVoQMcT.png) or [Memory Amplifier](https://imgur.com/uDGFbew.png) that grant additional global mod to have chance to get these require modifiers toward ur memory maps.

[*ZiggyD make a guide on how to make full use of those memories that grand mods*](https://youtu.be/JdpYNIN89ck)

#26. Complete Memory Amplifiers

Normal. 20 is not a big number, just look out for those [Yellow Square](https://i.imgur.com/FjuSgli.png) then try to reach out to them.

#27. Connect Memories

Normal. The maximum amount of fracture memory you can put on ur memory map is **20**, so if you're trying to do the last one first try reach out 2 memory amplifiers then one distant memory, only then start branch out ur memory chain maps till a total of 20 memories to complete the challenge.

#28. Complete these Encounters III (36/40)

* [**The Shaper**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTH1tqbOgII) - Hard, **Anomalies** is the [vortex balls](https://youtu.be/KTH1tqbOgII?t=10m37s) that spawn once every few seconds and when touched player will create a vortex that permanently stains the arena until the phase ends. 

* [**UBER Vessels of the Vaal**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHLl6Z6-ZeU&amp;t=228s) - Normal, this require uber atziri map which means also means only player who can kill uber atziri can do this, thus high DPS build. For a uber atziri build dealing this boss(first phase) shouldn't be a problem, most of the time just kill off both of them pretty fast, so if you're build can't do uber atziri just ask other experience play to do it.

* [**Syndicate mastermind**](https://www.poelab.com/catarina/) - Hardest, this require a Range High DPS build to do this challenge, those volatile skeleton won't disappear untill mastermind got defeated. To do this challenge is lower mastermind life really fast in each phase(4) so that she won't have time to raise skeleton, till the last phase watch out for the [green glowing mushroom](https://media.giphy.com/media/20vGgPQjcGyfyYyQ6B/giphy.gif) on the floor, that's where she raise the volatile skeleton. Don't run over any over those green mushroom and let them sprout into skeletons, then try don't near those skeleton as they explode when u near them. After all skeleton raise then only DPS down the boss to complete this challenge.

* [**Five Essences**] - RNG rate: RARE, fighting them is not a problem but FINDING THEM is a big problem, pretty RNG dependent for this challenge. Just try use Remnant of Corruption essence on every essence encounter that contain more than 3 essence to have chance becoming more than 5.

***OVERALL:*** Hard. This challenge are a bit more tricky and harder to do and all of them are hard end game map's bosses, only can be done for very experienced players, so just try to ask experienced players for help, then should be easy to complete this. Except for that RNG 5 essence might need to buy from other who had it(look out for **/trade 820** chat channel) if ur having bad RNG to find them.

#29. Complete Distant Memories II

***NEW CONTENT! Will update soon ...***

#30. Reach Level 90

Normal. This .... require a decent build to do this, require within a month to reach this level. If bad build that die a lot then .... maybe then need around a month+

#31. Identify Fractured Items

Normal. Fractured items only drop from fragmented memories and memory nexus, so just keep farming them to reach this 1,000 number, require a month or more grind to complete this challenge.

#32. Complete the Cortex I

***NEW CONTENT! Will update soon ...***

#33. Complete Maps with Eight Mods

Normal. This is harder than unidentified rare map, to have 8 mods on red maps(T11+), you need to use Vaal Orb to corrupt a map into 8 mods. And again, just ask ppl help you deal with the dangerous map that u crafted, or make a rotation party to farm 8 mods red tier maps will be a bit easier.


[**Click HERE for 8 modifiers red map search via PoE Official Trading Website**](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade/search/Synthesis/EdKnvLf5)

#34. Complete Unique Maps

Normal. Do 15 out of 19, with the help of [The Encroaching Darkness](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Encroaching_Darkness) divination card, this challenge will be slightly easier to complete as you keep grinding end game maps collecting this cards. Even your RNG is sux collecting these card, you could buy some of the unique map [**at here**](https://poe.ninja/challenge/unique-maps), most of the unique map are quite cheap.

The least 4 favorite unique map I would skip is ... **Hall Of Grandmaster**(hard), **Perandus Manor**(very expensive), **The Putrid Cloister**(expensive), and **Doryani's Machinarium**(expensive) depending whose the 3rd expensive map is =P


#35. Complete these Encounters IV

* [**The Beachhead**](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Harbinger) is part of the harbinger league mechanic which introduced during [3.0.0 expansion](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Harbinger_league). You can get this unique map easily from upgrading map by using [Harbinger's Orb](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Harbinger%27s_Orb) which can be obtain from Harbinger monster and syndicate's safehouse. This unique map is easy to do, just kill a bunch of harbinger mob that's it.

* [**Cadiro Perandus**](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Cadiro_Perandus) is part of the perandus league mechanic which introduced during [2.2.0 league expansion](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Perandus_league), you can only encounter when Janus is in Research Division(syndicate mechanic), thus this is pretty RNG dependent challenge, so just buy all item regardless trash or not from Cadiro whenever u got ur chance to have Janus in Research Division, is not that easy to move a syndicate to a division that you wanted, so many every chance count!

* [**Bestiary Boss**](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Bestiary) is part of the bestiary league mechanic which introduced during [3.2.0 league expansion](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Bestiary_league), now reintroduced by **Einhar, BeastMaster** in Act 2 town. There's 4 kind of bestiary boss, and out of all 4 Farrul is the hardest beast to fight with.

 * [**Saqawal, First of the Sky**](https://youtu.be/wpWhgQkaVYE?t=38s) - It's recipe require **Saqawine Rhex** that only appears in **Tier 5+** maps. This DINOSAUR boss not that dangerous but try don't stand in the tornadoes, they hurt more than anything else in the encounter

 * [**Craiceann, First of the Deep**](https://youtu.be/F73lzWwDm8A?t=30s) -  It's recipe require **Craicic Spider Crab** that only appears in **Tier 7+** maps. This CRAB boss same like bird boss are just loot pinatas tbh, haven't seen them alive long enough to do anything.

 * [**Fenumus, First of the Night**](https://youtu.be/uCR_MsNXANs?t=38s) - It's recipe require **Fenumal Hybrid Arachnid** that only appears in **Tier 10+** maps. This SPIDER boss deal a lot of chaos damage, so bring chaos resist flask, and dont stand in the stuff on the ground.

 * [**Farrul, First of the Plains**](https://youtu.be/ZqIA0MKiy6k?t=34s) - It's recipe require **Farric Tiger Alpha** that only appears in **Tier 13+** maps. This TIGER boss deal a lot of phys damage, so bring phys reduction flask, bleed immunity flask and dodge the stampede.

* [**Vaal Omnitect**](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Temple_of_Atzoatl) is part of the incursion league mechanic which introduced during [3.3.0 league expansion](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Incursion_league), now reintroduced by **Alva, Master Explorer** in Act 7 town. To complete this challenge u need monster level 75(T8) above temple atzoatl, and the area level of the temple is determined by the average level of zones a player opened incursions in plus 10 levels(buffed from 3.5.0), however its capped at the highest level of one of incursion the player did open.

***OVERALL:*** Normal. All of these are part of end game content for each of individual past league mechanic that they had decided to bring back as part of core game now, most of the challenge are normal except for Cadiro Perandus is a bit of RNG especially you only encounter him from Janus, you're maybe can buy from other if other ppl wiling to sell off their Cadiro encounter most of time if the deal is bad, then u just buy it from the other player's Cadiro ignoring the bad deal just for this challenge.

#36. Complete the Cortex II

***NEW CONTENT! Will update soon ...***

 * [**Ahuatotli, the Blind**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLBgthHxFDE) spawn in minimum delve 83 above.

 * [**Kurgal, the Blackblooded**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_ksWIuFHvo) spawn in minimum delve 150 above.

 * [**Aul, the Crystal King**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS93jAxU04o) spawn in minimum delve 250 above.

* [**The Shaper**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTH1tqbOgII) Hard. This is the last boss in the atlas of world(end game maps), the 2nd hardest boss in the game. To access this boss domain you need 4 type of map fragments that only drop from his [guardians](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Fragment_of_the_Chimera). Just like the uber atziri, just buy the service if you're build not capable to do it.(Slightly Expensive)

* [**Vaal Temple**](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Vaal_Temple_Map_(War_for_the_Atlas\)) Hard. Can get this through divination card name Lingering Remnants or vaaling T15 maps above only. The boss inside is pretty hard, not to mention with random add-on mods on top of this map make it more dangerous ... just buy the service if you're build not capable to do it.(Slightly Expensive)

***OVERALL:*** Hard, just collect the entrance key or make the boss spawn then ask for help to kill the boss.

#38. Complete Zana's Questline

Hard, her whole questline is all about defeating [**Uber Elder**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS3cZKASnfY) which is the hardest content that PoE(3.2.0) currently ever had. If your build is not top tier then try ask for experience player to help kill it when you can spawn Uber Elder.

**To spawn Uber elder**, you need to get all memory fragments 1st then defeat shaper for the first time, then start to pull elder influence near any of your tier 16 map, then start complete all 4 t16 map as elder start occupying each of them then end with elder taking over the big-cross at the middle of your atlas, then you can only access uber elder by using shaper's guardian fragment map, yes they same way you access shaper's realm but this time the elder kidnapping shaper into his realm and you need to beat them both at the same time in elder's realm.

#39. Synthesis Map Grind (36/40)

Nice improvement since previous league by making it **BROAD**, more ways to complete a challenge instead of very specific! Anyway back on topic, the fastest way to complete this challenge that i can think of is to farm 8 mods map in a trustworthy party rotation. A 8 mods map contain 90% to 120% quantity bonus excluding quality %, and you can push the quantity % even more by open the map together with [sacrifice fragment](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Apex_of_Sacrifice) which gives 5% per piece(total of 15% for 3 pieces), or [mortal fragment](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Alluring_Abyss) which gives 10% per piece(total of 30% for 3 pieces).

Hard, the number sound a bit harsh(1,000 map required if average 75% IIQ per map) but compared with previous league you can get more enjoyment from doing this challenge unlike last league braindead only atlas objective, kudos to the improvement for this challenge GGG.

#40. Complete Endgame Grinds (36/40)

* **Reach Level 100** This is gonna be hardest of the rest challenges. If your build not very end game or dying often ... highly recommended to skip this.

* **Reach Depth Level 600 in your Mine** Reaching depth level 300 above is much harder than t16 map because monster life and damage starting to scale up passively. Don't worry though it won't be dangerous as long you don't delve into deadly modifiers such ash penetration resist, more than two damage mod, and chance to steal charges if your build rely on charges like Righteous Fire Build. Best way to survive deep delve is bring couple of resist flask depending on delve modifiers, and with poison removable in case of ""poison on hit"" mod. Also you still can party up with end game build player to help get pass hard modifier delve.

 **Depth** | **Monster Level** | **Base Sulphite Cost** | **Darkness &amp; Light Resist** | **Monster Life** | **Monster Damage**
:---:|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
600 | 83 | 878 | -603% | 83% | 167%

* **[Open 500 Chests at the end of the Endgame Labyrinth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGWvIjUw2E4)** 500 is a lot of number but is by chest counts, which actually sound a lot better than 100 in the old league(bestiary). How? Each time you run a labyrinth will have guarantee to get at least **6 or 7 keys**(**3** from fully buffed Izaro, **2** from Curious Lockboxes behind gauntlet or puzzle, **1** from Argus, and last **1** from Darkshrine chances), so if you found an easy izaro with short layout labyrinth day, can farm a complete 6keys then you only need to do **500/6= 84 times!** And if you're lucky to get another 2 keys at the of the labyrinth treasure chest, then you can decrease the amount u need to do even more by 500/8= **63 times!!** Not even included another key from darkshrine yet! =D

* **Capture Beasts in Maps 500 times** Just always do Einhar's atlas objective that spawn daily in ur atlas map, 500 shouldn't be a problem is almost like around 100 maps(for average 5 beasts per map)

* **Complete your Syndicate Safehouses 40 times** 40 is a small number but with the current changes of betrayal mechanic is pretty hard to refill intelligence to access those safehouse, hopefully GGG will fix this if not ... then have to pick other choices =/

* **Complete 100 Distant Memories which contain a Boss Encounter or Fractured Laboratories** From [**Grimro synthesis guide video**](https://youtu.be/6KCMhOoMfKs?t=273) he mentioned there's an easier way to force(kinda) spawn synthesis boss in ur memory map, so should be easier to farm 100 of them as long u have enough fracture memory to reach/respawn them often.

***OVERALL:*** Hard, do 4 out of 6 of these choices, without a doubt I would skip that Level 100, that's ridiculous grind ... and also 600 delve not only is super difficult but also this challenge can't be bought. I'm always okay with labyrinth farming, 500 beasts sound okay ... 100 systhesis boss/laboratories sound okay too not that scary ... and lastly syndicate 40 safehouse just pray GGG will fix this make it easier to fill safehouse's intelligence  .... if not then have to make a character that able to do 600 depth delve =/

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#TL;DR: 

*Will update this part later when almost complete the guide info, so much challenge for new content so can't judge much yet ...*

I will still be active updating this page from time to time whenever I got new INTEL untill the league ends ;) Hopefully you guys understand my poor english and also helped new comer try to get 40/40 challenges =D

Main Problems of the Game and the Korean/Asian Game Syndrome,"I have been playing mff for almost 3 years now and I have been playing different Korea made games even before than that. Therefore, I want to share my experience and knowledge about this game and the connection it has with all the other games I played.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, what are the main problems of this (and the other games). Effort/Reward ratio. Normally any logical person would think that, if you give more effort to a certain aspect of a game, you should get better rewards right? Is this the case in mff? Not even close. Lets count the highest effert game modes in mff:

1. WBU

The rewards of this game mode is quite good yes and they offer you all the valuable stuff to t2 or t3 your characters and it has a great way to measure the power and effort of the players with the increased stages. However, the difficulty levels do not increase the rewards at all. There is like 1 or 2 piece drop increase (possibly) after tens of stages later. Booty boxes are not a bad idea but they already offer the best rewards at stage 20, why should anyone bother for a higher stage except for the glory?

2.  ABX

This is the main reason I posted this today instead of long before. Abx has an insane requirements for the players and even if you pay thousands of dollars you must still put some effort to reach the maximum score possible. What you get in return for this effort is like a total joke. You basically get exactly the same thing a 2 month old player who only does 100k and quits. 

3.  GBR

This game mode is sooooo goood and I reaaly love it. The concept is great, difficulty level is great (not too easy not impossible to do so just right) and it encourages you to build more characters in return. What about the rewards? Basically nothing. Some people just makes the argument of 35k gold is not bad and I feel like ""how can you seriously say that"". You can get 260k gold just by clicking clear button on the daily mission... You get more gold from a lot of different missions without doing anything. The main reward of the game mode is type enhancment kits but where are we even supposed to use that? The use of that is soooo limited that it makes absolutely no sense to increase your characters type enhancment. The other reward is the ctp chance while it has like 0.000001 chance and even if you get it its the worst ctp in the game. 

4.   Alliance Conquest

The only proper pvp game mode in this game after timeline and it is not even fun to do because of how ai works and all the other mechanics issues but lets ignore them for a while. You have to build an insane roster for this game mode, you have to build an insane alliance to have a great teamwork, you have to use a great strategy to have a chance and on and on. What do you gain at the end? 2m gold. Thats it. Thats basically less than half of the amount you get in a day without even puttiing much effort. Just whhhhyyyy?

&amp;#x200B;

Korean/Asian Game Syndrome 

This is a problem I like to call for the games that are produced in Asian countries and then released globally. What it means in short is the lack of communication between players and the developers. In mff we had mobirum for years and now we have the official forum. There were tons of posts in it to complain or to give feedback to the game. Yes I know most of them are trash but still there were a ton of reasonable requests as well. What happens then, either the mods ignore it and dont even check them, or they do really monitor it and try to resolve it by their means and send it to the developers and then gets ignored by the developers. Which results as no change at all for the problems the playerbase has. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why is this important for both the games future and the players. 

These are actually more important for the game developers interest than us. We can just quit the game anytime we want and pass on to another game. On the other hand, this is a bussiness for the developers and they earn money from it. These issues might seem to be insignificant for the developers but they actually hurt the longtivity of the game a lot. To a player, there must be a goal to reach on each phase of the game. For example, a beginner would like to build his iron man to 6 star which is a huge achievement for him. Or at a later stage a player would like to finish the shadowland. And what do we want as the endgame-veteran players? Our only reward is a small glory which is not even something we can show-off in most cases.  

&amp;#x200B;

What are my suggestions?

First of all a much greater bond should be created between players and the developers. I can see that they are trying to improve this with the new star-agent program and the patches they gave to respond the things players asked for but what I feel like is, they were all just for a show. Lets check what is done according to the needs of the community till now, 

First one (and the biggest one) 

Ultimates fiasco. This was the biggest step-back of the game developers for all times and how did it end? With a quite sad ending. 

Hyperion rework. Took 5 months, got a mediocre character at best.

GBR reward changes. Gold increased from 30k to 40k. WOOOOOW such a great increase. 

Luna snow uniform rework. DOUBLE the damage of 4th skill (which had like 0 damage so 0x2 equals 0) which is still not useful. 2nd skill got some supposed changes as well and I dont even know if that helped at all. 

They need to seriously stop these and make a proper change for both their benefit and for the game. 

  
Changes to game mode rewards.

Let me state this clearly, I dont ask for tons of free stuff. I am asking for a goal remember that. 

WBU

Just a simple change would work, change the first clear rewards from booty boxes to the rewards like we had for the previous wbu. For example you get a ctp at stage 50 or 60. This would encourage everyone to build their characters for wbu and give them a serious goal for at least a couple of months. 

ABX

Many people already mentioned this so rewards for higher scores could be added. Like some random bios and other stuff. And at 3 or 3.5m there should be a better reward so players would be encouraged to do it fully (like 10 ccf or 25 crystals).

GBR 

Give random bios, and change the availabilty of the ctp to others day by day so at least on the days we have good ctps available, we could try our chances. 

AC

This game needs a total overhaul. The best idea I can give is the coin or token system (whatever you call it). On each AC you will earn a certain number of coins depending on your attendance, win etc. Then there will be an AC shop which will have all kinds of stuff from cheaper items to really premium items for quite high prices. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the quite long post and thank you if you have read it all. I know this is not going to solve anything but I just wanted to share my feedback so who knows, maybe this could be a spark for the changes.

"Oldschool Everquest love isn't nostalgia goggles, and you should stop saying it is (Warning: Long)","EQ hit 20 years old today, and every post on the various MMORPG subs has people popping in with the ""You just remember it with nostalgia goggles!"" argument when people praise it, and it's bullshit. 

Did EQ have flaws? Of course it did. Especially if you were an anti-social gamer who refused to adapt. You could very well sit there on your ass for an hour LFG and not get anything. You could play 6 months and never get anywhere. You could play a class that casts 10 spells then sits for 5 minutes.  EQ was on YOU. Your success and enjoyment was all up to you. 

Heres what EQ Did right: 

-------------------
**Difficulty** 

Everything was deadly. The little snake in the desert with its 50%-0 poison. The orc hiding behind a pillar that comes with 2 others. This made the world feel dangerous. You had to pay attention to your surroundings and rely on other people. You had choices. Does your group delve into the dungeon and camp out at one of the deepest spawns that drops something awesome? Or do you chill outside and kill the mobs in front that drop nothing except exp? It was entirely up to you. This difficulty made the grind fun. Instead of going quest hub to quest  hub following some grade-school level story killing 10 rats and supposedly ""not grinding"", you found yourself a good group and did something dangerous. The most dangerous tended to have the best EXP and loot. 

-------------------
**Massive Class Difference** - 

It wasn't just ""These are tanks, these are DPS, these are healers"". They all had strengths and weaknsess, and even pandered to specific playstyles: 

* **Your Warrior** couldn't solo but was mandatory for any group fighting hard-hitting things. 
* **Your Bard** could take your group from ""meh"" to ""this is the greatest group of all time!"" with chain pulling, CC, group buffs, mana regen, speeding around at the highest movement rate, sneaking everyone through shitty stuff for the good spawns with group invis, offtank, and even a DPS with a charmed pet if you want a little chaos as it breaks every minute or so. 
* **Your Monk** was your high DPS, who was also the god of pulling, particularly in raids before bards took the job in later expansions. 
* **Your Wizard** was for people that want some AFK time, but also the best class to get your group out of an inevitable wipe with evac, or get your group back to the zone if you wipe and everyone suddenly ends up back at spawn points around the world.  
* **Your Enchanter** locked shit down cause pulling 3 things in EQ was a death sentence. A good one ran a pet that was hasted and buffed to god-like status and tore through things, including the enchanter if they aren't paying attention. Also mana regen. Turning your AFK wizard into a powerhouse who only afk's 1/3rd of the time.  
* **Your Necro** the easy solo king, and one of the few classes that needed no help to level quickly. 
* **Your Cleric** was the absolute pinnacle of healing 
* **Your Druid** was the hybrid or backup healer who could lay out some DPS, or just save you some time on the trip to the dungeon with a port. 
* **Your Shaman** was the buffing and debuffing god, making things that would usually shred a tank hit like pussies while your melee DPS hit like trucks with their entire buff bar full of stuff. 
* **Your Rogue** could drag all of your corpses out of danger if you fuck up, and you are going to fuck up, because, again, EQ is HARD. 

-------------------
**Immersion and a wild world**

Modern mmorpgs are very paint-by-numbers. You have a bunch of NPCS that are obviously tagged agressive or nice laid out in very specific places with 0 surprises. It's boring. 

In EQ, every city is filled with factions. Some hate each other. You might stumble into the evil necromancer area of a neutral city and get wrecked for not being one. You might work your ass off to get your lizard character loved in the nearby city, which gives you access to half of it until you stumble into the Paladin guild and get melted. Your race, class, or even religion could piss someone off. Even dungeon mobs loved/hated certain races. The cat race was perfectly fine chillin with any tiger/lion/whatever in the game. Certain religions would start completely neutral with an endgame dungeon and only be attacked there once they went on a rampage. 

Quests are not marked and everywhere. You have to talk to NPCS and physically respond to them. You can discover quest items just killing stuff and find out it's for some monks world-spanning best in slot weapon. Many are epic journeys that take you across multiple raid or group zones. Some aren't worth it, but a few introduce the best loot in the game. And that's another thing... 


**LOOT!**

Can you name 5 items your current character is wearing in WoW/FFXIV/GW/ESO? It's generic stats. Everything is. Replaced every tier, or while leveling every zone.  An item level. That's about it. 



In EQ, loot is scarce! You might pick something up at level 30 that will last you to 50. It might be an item with no stats at all but some of the best utility in the game. There are so many ""Legendary"" EQ items that you don't even have to be at level cap to acquire. Jboots, haddens earing, FBSS, cloak of flames, Fungi tunic, and that's just stuff from small group or solo content and all of it is rare or hard to get. I had things on my characters that lasted me through multiple expansions. Hell we'd farm stuff from 2 expansions ago for specific pieces. There might only be 5 people on the server with the Shadowknight epic weapon. 

 Add in resist gear forcing you out there farming weird spawns, keys, and a host of other things, progression was largely horizontal with a slight vertical rise across multiple expansions.

To get this loot, you needed to worry about the #1 thing that made EQ a big persistent online world, and my final point: 

-------------------
**Friendship and reputation!** 

This is the #1 thing we have seen absolutely gutted in modern mmorpgs, and one of the things that people *can and did* fail at. When you hear horror stories about people not being able to find a group for 4 hours and logging off for the night accomplishing nothing, these are the ones that failed at EQ essentially. This game was 100% about building connections, as was the *expectation* for an online world. It's not *meant* to be played alone. 

When you logged in with plans to progress, one of the first things you checked was your friend list and guild list, and if you are someone who doesn't want to LFG for 3 hours as a DPS, it was absolutely essential. You build both of these. You formed ties with people that excelled. You joined an active guild and mixed your external buddies with your internal guildies.  You got your group together from the 50 some contacts at or around your level in 15 minutes and were off. 

And because the grind was so long, your reputation was incredibly important. Getting blacklisted on a character you dumped 2 months into was basically a death sentence. This forced people to be relatively pleasant to one-another. You couldn't be an antisocial outcast in EQ. If you changed your name, they listed it right on the website to let people know. 


-------------------

EQ Did have it's issues. The grind was intense, and bosses were mainly tank and spank, but there is a reason so many crave it, and a reason why these progression servers are all filling up. It's not *all* nostalgia and never was. 

The reality of it is, we aren't playing massively multiplayer online RPGS anymore. We are playing solo RPGS with online lobbies for instanced content. People want the online persistent world back.

The Fate of Himmler/Burgundy Endgame,"I've been thinking about all the paths for the SS. We don't know very much about Burgundy as of yet, but I'd like to put in my 2 cents and theorize the main possibilities.  


**1. Heydrich looses the civil war, Himmler gets fucked**

This could happen in a variety of ways, Himmler dies sometime after the civil war causing Burgundy to collapse, Economic troubles(?), Germany invading Burgundy, etc. This is probably the most likely outcome for Burgundy as the chances of Heydrich winning are very unlikely. 


**2. Heydrich wins, Himmler nukes the world**

I guess this is probably the best ending for Burgundy in the long run. Even though Himmler himself will die, the SS are still the most well prepared and organized with their Alpine bunker system. We'll probably get some special post-apocalyptic events for this. Possible SS conquest of the old world in 100 years? How Heydrich would react to this plan remains to be seen. 


**3. Heydrich wins the civil war, Burgundy gets incorporated into the Reich** 

This one might be more of a longshot and really based on nothing, but hear me out. 

If Himmler dies after Heydrich wins, but before he can put the nuke plan into action, then it would be reasonable to assume that Heydrich would become de-facto head of the SS. I guess it is a possibility that Heydrich could still nuke the world depending on how many other people in the SS know about the plan and if the idea gets back to him, but I don't think anyone has said that anyone besides Himmler knows about the plan. 

As for Heydrich possibly betraying Himmler, I still believe that it could be possible (I really have a doubt Panzer would ACTUALLY reveal that know how secretive everything else about the mod is) but still very unlikely as he would probably get assassinated before or directly after an attempt on Himmler's life. I would still love their to be a Mexican standoff event between the two though. If they both end up dying due to something like that the Reich as a whole is probably completely fucked.


The point is I really don't see any way Burgundy could survive until the endgame in a traditional sense. Who knows maybe the devs are laughing at how retarded I am. I am very curious to see how Heydrich would run the Reich in the long-run though, especially with that 'Into Russia' focus seen at the end of the German diary.

"[Avengers: Endgame] Revisiting possible ""spoilers"" some cast members said while doing marketing for Avengers: Infinity War that people may have forgotten or never heard of before...","One of them is what Scarlett Johansson said in 2017 in an interview with Stephen Colbert on his late show, she said that in one scene there's like 32 characters. Now obviously this didn't happen in Infinity War, but at the time I remember people speculating it would happen in Infinity War. This could only mean two things... it's a deleted scene or it happens in Endgame since most of us by now know Infinity War and Endgame were filmed back to back. 

The second one is what Sebastian Stan said in a press junket for Infinity War in 2018, the quote: “There was one scene, I think we had where everybody was there. I can’t really talk about that scene, but I knew it took them three months in planning this scene to have everyone there. You looked around and just saw everyone from Samuel L. Jackson to Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, everybody was there. I kind of just stood in the corner and looked, and wanted to see how everybody would interact. But it’s surreal.”

My thoughts on some of the overreaction regarding CM.,"Okay, perhaps people have already made the same kind of post I'm about to make, I don't know, I literally just made this account because I couldn't take all the nonconstructive ""critique"" I've seen about the movie/the character herself  etc. (But I do apologize if this is considered spamming)

So, I'd like to address a few things in the movie or about Carol that had a lot of people ruffle their jimmies over (and still are).

&amp;#x200B;

**The politics within the movie (or in this case, the feminism)** \- *First off*, I'd like to make clear how hypocritical a lot of people (not all) are being when they complain that they refuse to watch CM because of it being political or having it's politics ""shoved down their throats"" (which, I may add; is a very overused term applied to almost everything regarding something said person doesn't like to hear about or see), when the following movies of Marvel contain a LOT of political messages (with some, you could even say is the basis of the movie) such as: Black Panther (This one even more so because it was released during Black History Month, likewise with CM being released during International Women's Day), Civil War, Winter Soldier, Iron Man and the list goes on. Even non-Marvel movies that are incredibly popular have a huge amount of politics in it, main example being Star Wars (old and new). The fact that people want to generalize saying they don't want any politics in their movies/shows etc when all/most or a good portion of the stuff they watch contain them, baffles me.

&amp;#x200B;

*Second point:* People are overreacting with the amount of feminism in CM, I can only recall about 3-4 scenes that could've been dubbed as ""feminist agenda"", such as when: Maria snapped at Talos for calling her 'young lady', the biker guy who told Carol to smile for him, the bunch of men picking on Carol  because she was failing at her training, and...that's all I've got. I think the main issue with this is that many people are LOOKING for these kind of messages for them to complain about, I'm not pro-feminism nor am I anti-feminism, but I could barely recall any of the feminist messages in the movie nor was it ""shoved down my throat"" noticeably, if people would just ignore it instead of eyeing for any moment that could hint at the slightest political message, maybe they wouldn't be bothered by it. And even if those scenes were feminist messages, those are COMMON problems that many women face! They're not just throwing it in for you so we can antagonize men, no, those are very real problems which, unfortunately, many people want to disregard and just label it as ""feminist junk"" and shove it away, and because of that, I find some of the nicknames for CM such as, ""Captain Feminist"" to be asinine as it implies that feminism plays a huge role in the movie (and no people, a confident or powerful female character doesn't = feminism, those personality traits aren't reserved for men), and not to mention that CM is obviously not harboring anything against men because Talos, Fury and that mentor guy (I forgot his name) were all great characters, to me at least.

&amp;#x200B;

**Her being a ""Mary Sue"", emotionless, a wood plank etc** \- The thing about these kind of statements is that I have a strong feeling that not many people knew about CM until her movie was announced, nor have they read the comments. Because as far as I can remember, even in the comics she's been this strong, and the reason many may feel this way is because of how she was introduced and I mean in a sort of last minute before the big movie, last minute? So then people just have this image of her being this random woman dropping into the group of the beloved characters we're familiar with and will ""stop"" Thanos (If I remember correctly, she was a big help but she definitely didn't defeat Thanos, Adam Warlock did If I recall accurately), and how can she be considered a Mary Sue when she was beaten by her mentor in the beginning of the movie? And throughout the fight with her ex-teammates you could see she couldn't handle her ""new"" powers (when she used her energy blasts she knocked herself back), showing that she didn't fully master it.

&amp;#x200B;

*Her being emotionless or lacking humor,* I sort of understand what people mean by this but you have to understand that for as long as she can remember, people have been slapping her on the wrist whenever she started to show even the tiniest bit of emotion (heck, you could tell in the beginning she had emotions because she was getting fired up which activated her powers, and then in the end when she's all giggly and blasting ships), and when you've been repressed like that for so long, you don't really just all of a sudden break down into quipping everywhere and dying of laughter (or at least, in most people's cases..), and then certain emotions may not have been appropriate because of the situation such as: When it was revealed she was fighting on the wrong side of the war the entire time, the basis of her not having her memories, the confusion of trying to find out who she is, etc etc. I feel like some or a lot of people are so used to seeing quips being busted out every moment or everything being treated like a comedy that when there's a more serious tone (that ties into the plot), there's problems with that apparently. And I, personally, think that Carol had a great balance between being serious and humorous and her humor may not appeal to many? (She seems like she cracks dry or sarcastic jokes) and there are quite a few male leads who're stoic and emotionless but they're always acknowledged as being macho or cool etc. All I ask is for people to consider the points that I've stated because I think regarding her personality and being emotionless not many people are looking into why this could be and just stares at what's in front of them, I'm not saying the writing is perfect, but it's not as horrible as many make it out to seem. And remember, this is her first movie, meaning that there are some that start out slow or setting up for something later and it just needs another to fully establish that.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to try and wrap this up because it's getting late, but last but not least:

&amp;#x200B;

**Thor &amp; Carol's short scene at the end of the Endgame trailer** \- This, for some reason has gotten a few negative comments with a some of the Youtubers (and also other posts on social media) I watch that review movies/trailers etc, not sure if I can call them out (I'm not aware of the rules on here?) but pretty much during the scene, 3 of Youtubers said that Carol was being ""confrontational"", ""feminist reminder"", or that she can't ""get along"" with the avengers. Normally, I don't get upset about negativity regarding stuff I like, as we all have our own opinions and I try my best to respect that, but when something is being unfairly criticized in a bias or asinine way, I will point it out. What I don't like about those statements is that Thor was the one who walked up to her, pretty much sizing up and then summons his axe(hammer?) and she was the one to turn around to that, he initiated the confrontation and all she did was stand her ground (which I think fits her personality and a few people would do, right?), I can't process how she's in bad light when he came at her first and she responded. Barely moved and she's being called a reminder that her purpose is for a feminist movement or she's causing trouble for the others, perhaps I'm overlooking something but to me this seems like an obvious bias.

&amp;#x200B;

"Thoughts on ""Whatever it takes"""," Just a thought about Endgame's tagline ""Whatever it takes"". The line was used multiple times by various characters in the latest Endgame trailer.

I think this movie is really going to showcase the theme of sacrifice. The heroes failed in Infinity War because they couldn't let go. They couldn't sacrifice each other lives or see them in pain.

**Some examples**

* Not destroying vision &amp;amp; Mind Stone earlier
* Saving Stark over Time Stone
* Loki giving up Space Stone for Thor
* Gamora saving Nebula

In contrast, Thanos was willing to lose one thing he loved truly, his beloved daughter, Gamora. Superbly quoted by Thanos himself - ""I have ignored my destiny once. I will not do it again, even for you.""

I owe you all an apology. A humbling Captain Marvel experience.,"First off, I want to say I’m sorry for how much crap I talked on Captain Marvel. I’m so very sorry, and I want to personally apologize to all the women on this sub. 

I’m sorry for ever doubting this movie, I’m sorry for doubting Brie Larson. She’s incredible. This movie was awesome.

I had a realization, before going into the theater, that I had been crapping on this movie and taking all the fun of seeing this movie. I told myself, why not just go into it with no expectation and just for the sake of having fun. 

...And you know what happened....I HAD FUN. I had a BLAST (no pun intended). 

I subverted all my expectations and freaking loved it. 

Now, I am not saying the ENTIRE movie was GOLD incarnate. Yes it had some problems. 

*What I would like to do, is to say a criticism, BUT also add something that I liked from it in the same breath!* 

Here it goes:

1) I didn’t find all the 90s music nods all that appealing. I get it is good for connecting our brains to the time period, but it jus fell flat for me. BUT THE SCORE WAS AMAZING. I LOVE all the atmospheric spaciness to it. 


2) There were a couple lines that were a bit wooden for me, and really went a bit too far in the “feminism is right, men are dumb” - That being said, the dialogue between Carol and Maria (especially the one where Maria was really empowering Carol and telling her who she was and showing her the power she had in herself was so good, it nearly brought me to tears. We need MORE of this sisterhood empowerment in our movies. Authentic Sisterhood is dope.)


3) I do have to say, and this is my honest opinion, I REALLY hope the MCU has CM in more team-oriented movies and NOT in any solo adventures. Seeing her fight at the end alone was probably the most boring part of the movie. Where there was teamwork and multiple shots of Carol and the team fighting was when it was the best. (The scenes with her fighting alone felt too DC/godlike to me, and she really shined when fighting alongside her team and playing off of them, whether that be in combat or with her great quips with Fury). 


That’s all I got for now, I wanted to get this down and put it all out after my initial reactions. 

Endgame is going to be dope, but more importantly, I can’t wait to be a father, and show this to my future daughter. She’s going to love this.

The Skywalker Saga Endgame,"So I think I have a solid idea of where the Sequel Trilogy is headed.  Most of this involves reading material Lucasfilm created after the Clone Wars.  We can argue whether or not its canon anymore, but I assume it mostly is.  There are reasons why I don't think they've ""recanonized"" it but I'll address it in the comments if you want to go all bibliography on me.

I primarily want to talk about the Mortis Arc.  It's confused the hell out of a lot of people in the Star Wars community, including myself, but it seems like it's a very significant piece of the structure of the saga and how Lucasfim is defining the force post-prequels.    If we're going to play guessing games about what's going to happen in these films, figuring out what the heck this series of episodes means is step number one.

When you look at it, the main idea of the story is that Anakin is identified as the chosen one and is supposed to take the place of the father in controlling the dark son and the light daughter-- you know, balancing the force.  The interesting part is:  he doesn't.  He's able to pass the father's test and control them, leading the father to think he's the one, but he's not and refuses.

The son, realizing Anakin's power, tricks Anakin into doing his bidding through fear by showing him what will happen in the future.  The daughter (representing the light side) is killed, and at the end of the whole arc, the dark and light are destroyed-- including the father who represents balance.

This mirrors our 3 trilogy saga perfectly:  Everyone thinks Anakin is supposed to bring balance to the force because he exhibits the qualities of what the Chosen One is supposed to be, but he doesn't.  Instead, someone representing the dark side is able to take advantage of him to snuff out the light, and in the end everyone's dead-- no light (jedi), no dark (sith), but also no balance (allowing the rise of Snoke).

The very existence of a dark threat in the Sequel trilogy precludes the idea of Anakin having been the Chosen One that brings balance,  because there very clearly is no balance.  So what on earth was Anakin, if not the Chosen One?

A false Chosen One, created by (according to Lucasfilm in 2012) Darth Plagueis.  It's really an ingenious plot:  Darth Plagueis would create a human being that would exhibit all the qualities of the chosen one the Jedi prophecy alluded to, except he would be an agent of the dark side, prone to giving into anger and desiring power.  And that's what Anakin is:  A little s\*\*\* who's basically the best example of a person the Jedi should \*not\* train, given chosen one status because of his unnatural force abilities, who leads the Jedi to ruin.  Plagueis's plan was to destroy the Jedi from within, by screwing with their religious prophecy among other things.

If you want more (convincing) detail on this, go [here](https://spoiledbluemilk.com/2019/01/02/anakin-skywalker-false-chosen-one/).

Now I know that Darth Plagueis around here is a dirty word, so lets just eliminate it.  It's still heavily implied that Anakin is a false chose one. 

This makes PERFECT sense if you are to add another chapter to the story.  Episode 6?  Sure, he's the chosen one.  But as soon as Episode 7 exists, he's not (sorry angry fans, they changed the story).  If Anakin isn't the chosen on, and Pla... Snoke is  on the rise trying to take over the Galaxy with Vader's decendent-- who's supposed to stop them?

Enter Rey:  The actual chosen one.

&amp;#x200B;

BONUS CONTENT:

If you're all aboard the Rey Skywalker train, here's another thought:

Padme is the Chosen One.  The Force used her to intercept the False Chosen One the minute he was picked up by the Jedi (when she visits on Tatooine and Ankin asks if she's an angel).  Throughout Anakin's entire life, Padme is the only one he ever cares for, and she's the only one besides Palpatine that can control him.

Who's the one that starts the rebellion (in the multiple unfortunately deleted scenes of Episode III)?  Padme.

When Padme dies, it's not because her heart is broken-- it's because the force spirit that is inside her is being passed to her children.  Now the Sith creation and the chosen one are combined into one, and her children go on to either run the rebellion or face down Vader and turn his heart.  When Plagueis returns, their own children are the ones to destroy him.  And when he returns again in Episode IX, they'll do it again and bring balance.  To quote Yoda:

 ""No longer certain that one ever does win a war am I. For in fighting the battle, the bloodshed already lost we have. Yet, open to us, a path remains that unknown to the Sith is. Through this path, victory we may yet find. Not victory in the Clone Wars, but victory for all time.""

Shrieker Shell,"Bungie, could we get an exotic ghost shell that is shrieker themed but with our ghosts eye in the middle instead of the never seems to register a crit hive thingy.

Could drop from EP wave 7, or if we get a new hive raid/endgame activity.

I feel like with the all powerful sunshot shell rising up, and the potential malfeasance shell, we need something to counter those monstrosities.

Potential perks (satire)

Strange-looking arc soul: This ghost perpetually sprays hive magic everywhere as long as you have your ghost out.

How tf is this allowed in crucible: Enemies hit by the magic are marked. Defeating marked enemies transforms you into an unstoppable Abyssal Champion for 10 seconds.

Seriously, how has Shaxx not noticed this: Defeating an enemy who has shrieker shell spawns in a wizard who continuously spawns cursed thrall that regen your health on kill.

Light Devourer: Defeating an enemy guardian with shrieker shell permanently kills them, causing them to have to restart the entire game.

Shrieker shell can only be defeated by the tyrant shell for obvious reasons.

(Disregard all the bs perks, I just thought this would be a cool idea)

Survivor Borneo Review and Character Rankingd," 

I have been working on a full series rewatch of survivor, mainly to solidify my opinions on certain seasons and characters, and I am looking for a place to post my overall thoughts on each season. I completed watching this season over a month ago, but I am somewhat hesitant to post my thoughts on the main subreddit, because my opinions don’t often align with the general opinions of this community. Ultimately I have decided that I would like to share my thoughts, and hopefully offer a different perspective. 

&amp;#x200B;

In general the main thing I look for in a survivor season, is a good cast, strategy isn't very important to me, and I find conversations about idols and vote splitting to be tedious and dull. Overarching narratives, and compelling storylines also something I consider very important in a good survivor season

&amp;#x200B;

Overall thoughts

&amp;#x200B;

This season is absolutely phenomenal, anyone who says this season is boring because it's “predictable” is just insane to me. Borneo starts out as a group of people from different walks of life coming together to form a  society, but ends in a place where everyone has given up their morality for a chance at 1 million dollars. Every decision made feels so important due to the simplicity of the original format. More recent seasons have felt like watching the contestants playing against production with so many idols twists and advantages, but Borneo really feels like the ultimate social experiment. 

From an Episodic standpoint, Survivor Borneo is very good. It really picks up at the Gretchen boot and absolutely never lets up. The Finale is absolute perfection and I adore it. The premerge is the weaker section of the season, but it isn't bad, it serves as very necessary exposition for relationships that will be important throughout the season. The Post Merge episodes are all fantastic, especially in The Gretchen boot and Finale

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Richards Game

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really care too much about strategy, but I would like to comment on what qualities helped the winner reach the end. FIrst off, I think Richard is overrated from a strategic perspective. He wasn't the first one to create an alliance, Stacey did. Richard came very close to being voted off in two separate occasions, and he most likely would not have won the game had he not gotten a few lucky breaks. That being said I think be played a much better social game than he gets credit for.  Richard seemed to be well liked by almost everyone, Including Rudy, the 72 year old navy seal. He was a very important part of the tribe by catching fish for the tribe and providing for them. Ultimately I think Richard is a very good player albeit a little overrated.



&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Cast Rankings

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to now rank the cast by how much I enjoyed watching them, feel free to tell me that my list sucks and why Im wrong, because this is entirely my opinion. For the record I think Borneo easily has the best cast of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

16. Dirk Been

Dirk is the only Character who doesn't feel multidimensional. The only thing I can say about him is that he is religious, which is fine, but that's literally the only thing I know about him after 5 episodes.

&amp;#x200B;

15. Stacey Stillman

Lawsuits aside, Stacey provided some good conflict with Rudy, but she didn't leave a large enough impact of me to rank any higher. 

14. Joel Klug

Joel is a pretty good character in my opinion. He provides some good conflict with B.B. early on, and was pretty consistent throughout the premerge. His elimination was complete bullshit though, he did absolutely nothing wrong other than be less charming than Gervase.

&amp;#x200B;

13. Sonja Christopher

Very fun first boot, her interactions with Richard and Sean in the premiere are very sweet, but she doesn't last long enough to be any higher on this list.

&amp;#x200B;

12. Ramona Gray

Ramona is way better developed than I remembered.Her story of finally integrating into the tribe, but it being too late is very tragic. Her relationship with both Gervase and with Jenna is fantastic. She is a much better character than I anticipated going into the season

&amp;#x200B;

11. B.B. Anderson

BB might be the worst survivor player of all time. I literally can't think of a single thing that he did correctly and it is fucking hilarious. He is the OG trainwreck and I love it.

&amp;#x200B;

10. Gretchen Cordy

This is largely symbolic, but Gretchen is still a great character in her own right. She is very charismatic and likable, and for all intents and purposes she probably should have ended up winning this season before the Tagis Hijacked the season. Her elimination is easily one of the most important eliminations of all time.

&amp;#x200B;

9. Greg Buis

Greg is very funny and pure entertainment for the time that he is on screen. The only reason he's not higher is because he isn't as important to the central storyline as the people above him.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Jenna Lewis

She really becomes fantastic from episode 6 to her boot. When she doesn't receive a video from home is absolutely heartbreaking. Unfortunately she isn't as compelling for her first 5 episodes for me to put her any higher.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Kelly Wiglesworth

Her last two episodes are phenomenal and deserve extraordinarily high praise. Her storyline of having a moral dilemma about joining an alliance is fantastic, but she lacks the personality for me to rank her any higher.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Sean Kenniff

Sean Kenniff is the embodiment of ineptitude and it is hilarious. The Alphabet strategy is hilarious. Sean thinking the remote island 30 miles off of Borneo is overfished is hilarious. Sean trying to make a bowling alley is hilarious. Sean is super enjoyable and its hilarious he managed to make it so far into the game.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Gervase Petersen

Gervase is fantastic. He is super charismatic and enjoyable to watch.  He probably my favorite side character of all time, because while he isn't super important to the main storyline, there are few contestants I enjoy watching more than Gervase.

4. Rudy Boesch

Rudy is amazing and is probably in my top 40 or 50 of all time. He is a quote machine and his relationship with Rudy might be the best relationship of all time. Its somewhat difficult to pinpoint exactly what I love about Rudy, but he is an essential part to the storyline of Borneo.

3. Colleen Haskell

Americas Sweetheart has an edge. She gave fantastic cutting confessionals about how the game had devolved, and about how she hated the Tagi’s. She makes the endgame of Borneo much more difficult to stomach, by watching much less likeable people advance over her.

2. Richard Hatch

From a Character perspective, Hatch is up there with the best. He is funny, charming, complex, compelling, fascinating, and dynamic in every way imaginable. He deserves all the praise in the world, and without his amazing narraratio, the season clearly would have been worse off.

1. Sue Hawk

I went into this season expecting Richard to take the number 1 spot, but he narrowly gets edged out by Sue. Sue will most likely remain my favorite contestant of all time for the rest of the shows history. Sue is everything Richard is and more. She has a fantastic relationship with both Kelly and Richard. She has a very tragic backstory, and she delivers the best Jury speech of all time that will never be topped.

&amp;#x200B;

I welcome any and all feedback, and I am interested to hear what you all think about my opinions.

Why NEW YORK. [Avengers: Endgame TV spot/ trailers],"In the First 'Avengers: Endgame' trailer, we see a [dark New York skyline](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ARDdXaz), presumably caused by a lack of resources to power the city post-snap. Others have pointed out that the scene of a Quinjet heading towards a lot up Tokyo skyline likely takes place closer to the snap, as Black Widow is shown to have [blonde hair](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ctQKDXq) when she met with Ronin/ Hawkeye, explaining why it was lit up in a world established to have power shortages.

However, in the first trailer, [we see many boats and settlements huddled around the statue of Liberty, dispite the skyline being dark](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/FL7eBul). Why they're there? Could be because it's a large city. Could be because it's a hub of people. But I think it's a more connected reason. I think that dispite the world going dark, New York still has power.

How you ask?

The answer of course being Tony Stark. Throughout both trailers, the Avengers compound has power, in [both parts of the time jump](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/dTrOt9t). Why? Because of Tony's Arc technology. Clean energy that lasts indefinitely. Why the settlements in New York? Because Stark Tower still has power since Iron Man set up an Arc reactor to power it [in Avengers 1](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/Cv0JmiX). Turning it [""[into a] *beacon* of self sustaining, clean energy""](https://youtu.be/GX7TSj4YN28). Through his own words.

My reasoning for Hina and Rui being the endgame.,"Reason for Hina: She sacrificed her dream and her family for Natsuo. She have been through so much. especially all the crying moments when she is in the island , always breaks my heart. I also can't stand someone as cheerful and sometimes childlike as her, being so upset and in so much pain because she have to be the grown up and mature person, always sacrificing herself. I loved to see the cuteness of Hina when she gets to be a little more free and childish. example , her squid moment (can't think of anything right now, will add in more when i can remember anything)

&amp;#x200B;

Reason for Rui: She grows so much because of Natsuo, from being unable to converse properly , not understand what it means to love someone , not wanting to be clingy to her other half, to being the cute girl who would get jealous, pout, death from embarrassment , and many other cute reaction that she is able to show (even the  upset/crying ones) because she is in love with Natsuo which is prove of how much she has changed and how much being in a relationship changed her . It also kinda felt more real to me, seeing their cute daily interactions where they sometimes are in a arguement or small disagreement, as opposed to Hina and Nat being quite smooth sailing and happy with each other. (until the photograph incident) Yes people might say Rui is being childish and immature for being jealous/upset over small things, but hey, they are just high schoolers/early college students. I can understand why she felt that way, because it was how much she loved Natsuo , how serious she is with the whole relationship and how important Natsuo is to her that she wouldn't want any chance of things screwing up between them. 

Which leads to some kind of obsessiveness that Mari mentioned (which i can also relate to as it also happened to my relationship before), which leads to the major incident that happened in the recent chapters. That break up mess me up so badly (again, because I can understand where Rui comes from and her line of thought and that I can relate to it as I was in the same situation). I did also think of doing something as drastic like that , but I never got the guts to do it when the problem just started in my relationship. My relationship kinda went downhill because of the exact same reason that Rui mentioned. It really makes me wonder how different it would be, if I have the guts and determination that Rui have to put her other half first. over her feeling for him)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I just like to see all the cute facial expressions and unexpectedly cute reaction from Rui that made me all giggly up whenever I see them. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, another thing I just thought of , is the age difference between Hina and Nat. Let's be honest, it is really not going to be easy as they have 6 years of age gap. (At least in the asian culture, not sure about western culture)

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly believe that depending on the reader's age and culture, you might enjoy the story differently. I would imagine a person who have been through some hardships in relationship will be able to better relate to the characters compared to some teens who haven't really been in a serious adulthood relationship. 

Someone from the western culture might also perceive some actions of the character differently as it might not seem a big deal to them but the characters reacted as if it is a big deal.",DomesticGirlfriend,19,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DomesticGirlfriend/comments/b2755p/my_reasoning_for_hina_and_rui_being_the_endgame/,Discussion,Kaexch,b2755p,/r/DomesticGirlfriend/comments/b2755p/my_reasoning_for_hina_and_rui_being_the_endgame/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DomesticGirlfriend/comments/b2755p/my_reasoning_for_hina_and_rui_being_the_endgame/,21,2019-03-17
Endgame Theory: Valkyrie and the remaining Asgardians have been recruiting an army from the 9 realms.,"We know that half of the Asgardians were left in before Thanos even snapped his fingers. This was confirmed in the movie as well as via statements. 

We do not know if Valkyrie survived the snap, but there is a good chance that she knew what to do:

Take the refugees to Asgard’s allies. Those who did not yet know would be told of Thanos and their new king—Thor’s fight against them. She would turn him into a martyr out of necessity if needed. 

Few would believe and join here, but after the snap? Well, that’s a game changer. Suddenly, the few impacted have a reason to get revenge. 


TL;DR: Valkyrie has been recruiting people from the 9 realms and will appear in Endgame with the power of the world tree behind her.

A Better Ending,"I put this together after reading / watching theories on what Season 8 should have been and  to address problems with Voltron's LGBT and  DMTI representation ([https://ptw30.tumblr.com/post/177063989519/smolsarcasticraspberry-we-need-to-talk-about](https://ptw30.tumblr.com/post/177063989519/smolsarcasticraspberry-we-need-to-talk-about)).  Personally I think it makes sense for Keith and Shiro to get together, but seeing how controversial that would be, this version would be the one I think almost everyone would be ok with.

&amp;#x200B;

**Season 7**

* When Shiro returns to his body, the black Bayard becomes his new arm. Because Altean magic.  Shiro plays a more active role in the early episodes helping Keith,.
* They go back to earth. When Shiro finds out Adam died, he is devastated. He’s a tough guy and all but this would be the point at which he just breaks down. He should say something like “I never got to tell him how much I loved him,” just to clarify the nature of him and Adam's relationship.  Keith comes to comfort his best friend when he needs it the most.  Other people come in and join Keith in comforting Shiro, re-affirming that Shiro’s still got family - the Paladins. This is probably when Curtis should be introduced if that’s going to be endgame.
* The Atlus needs Allura’s Altean magic to function. She helps finish building the ship and becomes the new captain. This is how she would redeem herself from her fuck-up helping Lotor earlier. She gains a new family of crew members. She hands the Blue lion back to Lance.
* Keith goes back to the Red Lion and Shiro becomes Black Paladin again. Original Team Voltron is back.
* Shiro kills Sendak.  He deserves that kill.

&amp;#x200B;

**Season 8**

* Lance is depressed and hanging out with Pidge. Mrs. Holt makes Pidge take Lance to the mall to cheer him up. They bond over video games and have a friendly competition to see who’s the most popular paladin. Lance realizes he doesn’t care that much and is happy how popular the green paladin is. 
* Keith and Shiro share some quality time together on Earth. Maybe race hover bikes and watch the sunset. They ask about each other’s romantic interests. Keith in particular would be concerned about how Curtis is treating Shiro, since he was around during the whole Adam break up. Keith would want Shiro to be with someone who can love and appreciate Shiro as much as he does.
* On clear day, Shiro should be either hanging out with either Curtis or Keith, or both.
* Allura is contacted by Lotor’s spirit via dark entity. He tells her where to find his body / Honeeva. Allura resurrects Lotor and Lotor joins team Voltron and try to stop Honerva. Honerva realizes her son is still alive but it’s too late, the reality hole opens.  Honerva then redeems herself by sacrificing her life to close it, with Allura’s help.  Allura doesn’t die.
* Allura helps Lotor resstore the Altean human batteries on the 2nd colony. Lotor apologizes for being such an asshole, but he is forgiven. He then helps Allura build a new Altea.  And maybe come to terms with his Galra heritage.
* If Shiro marries Curtis, Keith should be visible in the scene as his best man.  Later, Keith would be working together with Shiro and the Blades on humanitarian missions. This would make the most sense because the show does not convince us with the episodes we got that Keith can function on his own, let alone be in a relationship.",Voltron,18,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Voltron/comments/b2bshm/a_better_ending/,,darkbeastzero,b2bshm,/r/Voltron/comments/b2bshm/a_better_ending/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Voltron/comments/b2bshm/a_better_ending/,29,2019-03-17

I'm interested in seeing how the snap has affected Thanos.,"So we've definitely seen how the snap has affected many of the Avengers. Whether its Hawkeye losing his family, Rocket (the unofficial Avenger) losing Groot, etc. However, I think it'll be interesting to see how/if the snap has affected Thanos in any way. 

Sure his plans were accomplished, but I wonder if he's going to regret his decisions and maybe even allow himself to lose.

Still No Soul Wars?,"There is a massive amount of untapped potential by not bringing back Soul Wars and a few other pvp related activities. I have been playing Runescape since 2002-03 and I will say the single most fun I ever had with this game was pre eoc player vs player combat - specifically Soul Wars. 

&amp;#x200B;

Inb4 someone saying I only liked it for the XP. For myself and a lot of others - Soul Wars was endgame content with the amount of strategy, teamwork, and time that was put into winning sw games and character builds specifically for sw. I will never again come across a game that had the sheer level of excitement, fun, teamwork, strategy that Soul Wars did. Unless you were in the scene you may not understand how much strategy actually played a part of winning games and worlds. It was not just a barrage fest.. , it was hopping worlds with 30 seconds to go to sneak into a game and try to surprise a rival clan. It was rallying the troops and randoms that had given up hope with 3 minutes remaining for a last stand rush to win the game. It was having 1 player with 99 slayer, 3 with high range, a few with strong magic, even players ready to strategically bury bones in case we needed them! It was winning a game as the underdogs regardless of how strong the barrage was from strategy alone. It was truly a great time to play Runescape and a great pvp activity. I put more hours into Soul Wars as a maxed rs player than I will put into any game ever - that's fact.

I will expand on my true thoughts into why Soul Wars should be added to OSRS at a later time and different post.. this was written on a whim because I am blown away it has not been revived yet in OSRS and wanted to reminisce for a moment. Speaking for myself and several PVP Runescape OGs - the second SW comes back I will be no lifing Runescape like it is 2007 all over again. I know so many people that would come flooding back regardless of rewards. As soon as this happens I will buy OSRS membership for life (as long as combat never changes), lol. When OSRS dropped I loved it and played quite a bit.. but my progress stalled and I quit playing as I felt personally for myself I was missing what made OSRS truly OSRS, and for me that was the great PVP, and friends that came along with it. Bringing SW back would be a great addition to the game and would bring back a host of older players. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shout out xxDeath, The Godz SW, Doom Squires &amp; W/A. Shoot even if we were always better let's even hear it for NWO, Swa, Ancient Souls, Zealmania, Zombie SW, 3zealsftw where you all at!

[Anniversary NSFW Inspired] [Build Complete] Something a little different...,"TL;DR: Cheap low-power single-socket short-depth 2U LGA2011 build with 4x hot swap bays

## Parts

- Case - Norco RPC-2304: This case was the last stage in my 4U-&gt;3U-&gt;2U short depth rackmount migration. For reference, I need to fit everything into an SKB 10U Roto Rack that is 17.5 inches (440mm) deep. I started off with a Chenbro RM42300-F case that supported 6 external 5.25"" bays in two banks of 3, allowing me to fit two 5 in 3 Supermicro 3.5"" HDD cages for 10 hot swap drives in addition to the 3 internal drive bays. Then came the 3U ARK IPC-3U380, which had 3 external 5.25"" bays that supported an IcyDock Fatcage 5 in 3 hot-swap cage, in addition to 6-8 internal 3.5"" mounts depending on motherboard interference. Finally I arrived at the Norco RPC-2304, which came with four native 3.5"" hot-swap bays, and an internal 2.5"" and 3.5"" mount. All of these supported full-size ATX PSUs. The Chenbro was the only one to support a full-size ATX mobo, whereas the 3U and 2U only supported MicroATX (the ARK due to the internal HDD mounts and the PSU mount, the Norco restrained only in the PCIe slot direction by the PSU). An issue I have with the Norco 2U is its limitation to four loud 50mm fans in the front and 3 louder 40mm fans in the rear, and no cooling over the HDDs. 
- Mobo - SuperMicro X9SRW-F: In the original build, I had a consumer motherboard and a Q6600 pulled from an old computer. It was fine enough, but limited due to its consumer CPU/RAM support and old age. I then moved to a Supermicro X9SCL-F, which supported Xeons and had IPMI but used expensive RAM (Unbuffered ECC) and CPUs (Xeon E3 v1 and v2). I had some requirements when setting out for this build: low power (1 socket only, UNLIKE almost every other build here), IPMI, reputable (not the sub-$100 no-name Chinese 2011 x99 boards), MicroATX size in height (9.6 inches or 4 PCIe slots), more than 2 RAM slots and 1 PCIe slot (no ITX), support for CHEAP RAM (read: Registered ECC), and support for cheap but low-power varieties of CPU more powerful than the E3s I came from. The X9SRW-F was an odd duckling due to its proprietary form factor (8 inches tall, 13.5 inches deep, nonstandard mounting holes, nonstandard PCIe, 2011 narrow ILM) but apart from the mounting holes not aligning in my case I figured it would fit all my other needs. 
- CPU - Intel Xeon E5-2630L v2: I came from a Q6600, then to an E3-1220L, then to an E3-1265L SR0G0 (Yes, I know they didn't make this and had either a 1260L v1 or a 1265L v2, but somehow I have a 1265L v1). The most recent option was a 2.4GHz 4c/8t 45w CPU, and without jumping to Xeon v3 or v4 chips and DDR4 RAM I had limited options for cheap -L (low power) varieties of CPUs. Browsing through Intel Ark I eventually settled on the 60w 6c/12t 2.4GHz SR1AZ, which was easy to find cheap. I opted for this over the 70w 10c/20t 1.7GHz E5-2560L v2 due to its lower power consumption and much faster single core performance, not to mention cheaper price and higher availability.
- Cooler - Supermicro Passive 1U 2011 Narrow ILM SNK-P0047PS: I started in the 775 system with a stock Intel cooler, and carried that trend over to the E3 system. At some point I got a good deal on a Noctua NH-L9i which served like a champ on the 1265L. It had a 37mm hight but the socket placement on the X9SCL-F didn't push it under the backplane, so it was more than short enough for the case. However, it doesn't support the 2011 socket, much less 2011 narrow ILM. This new Supermicro 1U passive heatsink came with the motherboard, but I don't think I would have had many other choices. It looks like SM makes other similar narrow ILM coolers like the SNK-P0057PS or SNK-P0047PS+ but I can't see too much of a difference between them all. Regardless, due to the socket placement on the motherboard falling underneath the drive cage in my case, I would have needed a cooler that fit underneath. I couldn't find any active solutions, so the passive solution cooled with the 50mm fans at the front will have to settle for now. Since the CPU is only a 60w TDP model, this will suffice.
- Bulk Storage - The four HDD bays connect via a reverse breakout SAS8087 connector on the backplane to 4 SAS connectors on the motherboard. There was a separate SAS (4 port) and SATA (6 port, 2 6Gbps) controller on the motherboard, so the SAS ports + backplane work as one unit while the rest of the SATA ports work as another. I have two 6GB WD Purple, one 6TB WD Blue, and one 5TB Seagate drive in the HDD bays at the moment. 
- OS Storage - I have a 1GB USB drive plugged into one of the 4 USB ports in the back of the motherboard for ESXi. A second 4GB USB drive is used for unRAID. Last but not least, a Samsung 950 Pro 256GB drive is plugged into a low-profile M.2 to PCIe adapter which is plugged into the riser card. I recently discovered lower profile NVMe to PCIe adapters so I have a couple of those coming in from Ebay in the next few weeks which should improve the mounting durability.  
- RAM - 64GB (8 x 8GB) 1866MHz DDR3 Registered ECC: I think the first LGA775 server had 8GB RAM. The E3-1220L budget build had 8GB as well, and then the 1265L prompted a doubling to 16GB of DDR3 1333MHz ECC Unbuffered. With this new platform I could now use cheaper ECC REG DDR3 RAM, which also came in larger cheaper DIMM sizes. Additionally, the motherboard supports LRDIMM (load-reduced) as well as quad-rank (4Rx4) up to 1866MHz, so my options were wide open. After scouring Ebay through its dozens of 64GB kits (2x32GB, 4x16GB, 8x8GB) I finally snagged an 8x8GB kit that will hold me over until I can eventually score a deal on a 2x32GB kit. For now I'm using Samsung M393B1G70QH0-CMAQ8 8GB 1Rx4 PC3-14900R DIMMs, but I'm looking to get Samsung M386B4G70DM0-YK03 32GB 4Rx4 PC3L-12800L DIMMs over time as I find them. 
- PSU - Corsair SF450: I started with a Thermaltake Toughpower 650w PSU in my 775 system, and moved to a Seasonic X650 when I got the E3 system. I then got an awesome deal on a pair of SF450s a couple years ago and I've been using one in my E3 and now E5 platform. 80Plus Gold, low-load fan power-down (hybrid mode), fully modular, and an SFX form factor allow it to run in a 2U case without choking the fan's intake, like what was happening with the X650. My only complaints about this are that the hybrid mode isn't switchable like it is on my AX760, which would be nice to push some extra airflow through the case, and that all the cables are short and require extensions in some places. Once I eventually buy the crimping tools I'll make longer cables, but for now extensions or stretching will have to do
- Misc - Mobo Riser - Supermicro RSC-R1UW-2E16: When doing research on the X9SRW-F I saw the 1x and 16x PCIe slots on the motherboard, so I thought I was golden to just use them straight through (comfortable with abandoning the standard PCIe slot mounting). However, upon receiving the board and plugging a PCIe device or even a PCIe riser into the 16x slot, the system wouldn't boot. Upon looking more closely at the manual I saw that it states that it has PCIe slots ONLY (implicit) ""using riser cards."" It looks like I have two models to choose from, each one installable at the same time and pointing in different directions. I had the option of adapting the 16x slot to a single 8x slot facing to the top of the board using RSC-R1UW-E8R, or adapting the proprietary slot and the two 1x slots to two 16x slots pointing down using RSC-R1UW-2E16. I opted for the latter, which instantly resolved the no-boot problem when it came. 

## Build, Notes, Gotchas

- I had been worried about the proprietary motherboard layout fitting in the case, but it ended up not being an issue. 3 of the mounting holes even aligned with the case's standoffs: the two closest to the rear, and then the bottom one right near the bottom bank of RAM slots. For three of the other 4 holes in the board, I took standoffs from the case and cut off their screw portion that anchored them to the case. This made them the same height as the screwed-in standoffs, so while it didn't laterally anchor the motherboard it at least supported all portions at the same height.
- I measured about 10mm of clearance from the top of the heatsink to the riser, so a 36mm or shorter heatsink would be needed. This is pretty close to the 37mm of the NH-L9i so I might have just measured inaccurately. 
- The system runs ESXi 6.7u1 FREE as the main OS off the 1GB USB drive, with the 256GB 950 Pro as the datastore for VMs. I don't want to pay for VMware licensing so I don't use Vcenter or any fancy stuff. I connect it to the network with a single Ethernet cable, using VLANs to segregate WAN traffic from internal VLANs
 - Within it is an unRAID VM with the SAS PCIe hardware controller passed through to it, so unRAID has full controll over the spinning disks. The unRAID VM uses PlopkExec to boot off the attached 4GB USB drive and then operates like any normal unRAID system. I use it for file storage and as a network Time Machine backup target. I also occasionally mount it to ESXi with NFS and back up my VMs.
 - CentOS 7 VM running a variety of services and Docker containers
 - pfSense 2.4 VM as the primary gateway for the system
 - Windows 10 VM for running Windows applications like Blue Iris NVR, Emby Server, Unifi Controller, Google Play Uploader, and more
- Good 50mm fans are hard to find. I look for the thickest ones possible, which should move the most air at the lowest RPMs. 40mm fans are commonly found in 28mm varieties, but 50mm fans only rarely even come in 20mm varieties. Delta and Sunon seem to be the only ones I can find that are reputable, but I'm still looking. I know Noctua makes a 40mm 20mm thick option, but I think the 50mm fans move more air. For now I'm just using a variety of fans. 
- Once fans are found, slowing them down to reasonable volume levels is a challenge. I've got an order of 1 and 2 watt resistors coming in so I can make high-power versions of low-noise low-RPM adapters. 
- The CPU certainly isn't cool, with the IPMI interface reading 60c, but it's not overheating either and I don't yet have endgame fans pushing air through.
- The HDDs also have cooling issues since no air travels near them. They range from the mid-30s up to the mid-50s on hot days.  
- Whole system with the 4 HDDs spinning, a single 1.5v DIMM and under 50% load pulls about 85 watts from the wall. A far cry from most of the systems here. My previous E3-1265 system with 4 DIMMs pulled about the same. 
- The unRAID NAS has 17TB usable space and about 900GB free. I need to clean up and deduplicate some data on it, and I'm not using the largest drives I could anyway which is why I don't feel the need to build in a 4224 or something crazy like that.

Just got my second and third wins today in the gauntlet,"I am an average console player so it’s not super uncommon for me to get upwards of 5+ kills per game, but when it gets down to the last 1v1 I usually panic and choke. My first win ever was a few months after I started playing, achieved by bush camping until the final circle and catching the other guy by surprise. However, today I won 2 solo games in the gauntlet, both with three endgame kills. The thing I have always loved most about Fortnite is endgame rotation in the final circles, and how hectic it can be to balance building, rotation, and fights. I think watching so many clips of pro scrims has taught me a few things because my endgame rotations were way better than I have ever done. 
I love the gauntlets and they should definitely come back in the future.

[Endgame] A rough outline of events,"With time travel likely being a huge aspect of Endgame and the cryptic nature of the trailers, it's difficult to put together a timeline of events. But I have an idea of how things will play out....

1. Capt Marvel arrives on Earth early on in the film. Her and Thor travel to Titan 2 to rough up Thanos and attempt to undo the snap. Only to find the gauntlet is broken. There's no point to fight or kill Thanos bc of this. Carol and Thor return to Earth with bad news....

2. Tony and Nebula arrive on Earth (the trailer scene in the field with Cap, Nat, Rhodey and Bruce looking up is the Benatar landing). Tony &amp; Cap reconcile...Tony, Bruce and maybe Shuri (see point 4 below for more info) rack their brains trying to figure out what they can do to help fix things. Nat brings Clint back from Japan to Avengers HQ.

3. Scott Lang emerges from the Quantum Realm to a decimated timeline (as seen in the newest trailer). He seeks out the Avengers. Now that Scott has come back with Quantum energy, Bruce, Tony and Shuri now have the missing piece they need to ""fix"" things. Alot of exposition happens....They use the BARF tech and maybe some upgrades from the Skrull memory machine to look back at key events (times they dealt with the stones and maybe moments that led to them breaking up).  They go back in time and change things just enough to remain a team from 2012-2019. They may even encounter Thanos in the past multiple times. Past events from prior movies will play out differently.

4. The grand finale of the movie will have Thanos and his Black Order coming to fight the Avengers at their upstate NY HQ (This is the dark battle scene we see in the newest trailer). This is when we'll get Professor Hulk too. Enter Shuri's big contribution. Shuri has experience with helping Bucky with his mental issues and she knew how to SEPARATE Vision from the Mind stone. She can help Bruce and Hulk merge and work together. (This would've been a side project for Shuri throughout the movie)",FanTheories,11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/b2650t/endgame_a_rough_outline_of_events/,FanTheory,swayde620,b2650t,/r/FanTheories/comments/b2650t/endgame_a_rough_outline_of_events/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/b2650t/endgame_a_rough_outline_of_events/,12,2019-03-17

[Endgame Theory] Endgame will open up with a fight between Thanos and Cpt Marvel for the Power Stone on Xandar,"Theory, not a spoiler.

She'll be summoned by the Nova Corp as Thanos attacks. She'll arrive quickly, but Thanos will already have the stone. She will lose, be blasted into space and be knocked out cold as was Thor. She'll be woken up by Fury's pager and fly to Earth immediately (which takes a few days because she's on the other side of the galaxy), believing that she needs to reach Fury because the tesseract is in danger after Thanos seized a powerful artefact similar to it (the Power Stone). Thanos may even state that he recognises her energy/power signature [a concept established by Wanda/Vision in Infinity War] as being from a stone. She will be filled in on all the details once she arrives on Earth.

Her waking up and flying off to Earth will be the cue for the title card. From thereit will jump to the Avengers until Danvers turns up at the compound.

Reasons why I think this is a likely scenario.

1. It will show us what happened to Xandar, rather than it being some off-screen plot device.

2. It will show Thanos is a badass and Danvers couldn't take him and the Black Order solo. She needs the Avengers as much as they need her. She is immediately limited, whereas Captain Marvel showed her being limitless.

3. It will give us more Black Order if only for a few minutes (who were criminally underused in Infinity War).

4. It will show her own limitations, and that she isn't privy to all cosmic information. She'll need to be filled in by the Avengers and won't just turn up having the lowdown and all the information.

5. It could even serve as a means of linking Rhomann Dey to Earth to set up Richard Rider/Nova.",marvelstudios,1418,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/b2j702/endgame_theory_endgame_will_open_up_with_a_fight/,,cbfw86,b2j702,/r/marvelstudios/comments/b2j702/endgame_theory_endgame_will_open_up_with_a_fight/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/b2j702/endgame_theory_endgame_will_open_up_with_a_fight/,363,2019-03-18

\&gt;Tom Clancy's The Division 2 is the ideal sequel for those who enjoyed its predecessor. It builds on what worked, changes what didn't, and delivers a great new map to explore.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 expands the established gameplay mechanics and the world from its predecessor with amazing endgame content and lots of surprising enemy variety that was missed in The Division. Sadly the story sinks in the crowd of countless objectives and new content, which together with some gameplay bugs and glitches doesn't let the title reach its full potential.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Witnessing an entire squad full of players who are using completely different abilities in what is essentially a cover-based tactical shooter is quite the sight. It still has that semi-grindy feel, but it's engaging in the sense that the grind is never a chore.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The Division 2 is not a new game that upturns the tea table on Washington. It obviously uses all things that made the success of the first one and it is difficult to blame him on that. However, it refines a large number of aspects with small adjustments. This makes it more enjoyable and even more effective if you can play regularly as a team to go even further and live intense moments in the Dark Zone. Did you like The Division? You will love the Division 2. But do not ask this sequel to turn black in white.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;With a decent end-game experience, The Division 2 becomes much better than its prequel, and I believe it's even better than Destiny 2 and much superior to Anthem. However, the PS4 version has been suffered a serious Bug which repeatedly crashes the game since its initial release day.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;\[Review In progress\] I still have a long ways to go and the game could introduce more variety than I’ve experienced so far. The combat itself is stellar in design, it may be a cover shooter with just human enemies, but it’s possibly the most tightly knit one to exist in gaming so far. Everything about it is expertly designed and executed beautifully. Ubisoft has really learned a lot from the failings of other similar titles, and that of the first Division.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;The Division 2 has way more content than the original, it is set in a bigger more varied city, and shows great balance in loot and  character levelling. It is too conservative in gameplay and level design, but we still love its gunplay and cover system. Review in progress.

\&gt;The Division 2 is an online, shared-world looter-shooter done properly from the start. Massive Entertainment have crafted an engaging experience worth sticking to for the long haul.

\&gt;From what I’ve played so far, The Division 2 is a substantial evolution on the mechanics of the first game, with a more immersive world to boot.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;While I’d love to see out the whole thing – the main story, not the time sink endgame – coop, it’s how The Division 2 performs as a single-player campaign that may ultimately decide how far I take this fight.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;If the first Division never did it for you then the sequel is unlikely to win you over. This is a sequel with a small 's', refined rather than revolutionary, squarely aimed at fans of the first game who are eager for more.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;My biggest problem with The Division 2, an issue also present in the original for me, is that it's not all that interesting aesthetically or mechanically.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;For now, I have to at least commend The Division 2 for getting the basics right. There’s a compelling endgame, there’s loot that actually matters, and missions don’t feel like they’re copy and pasted to bulk out the runtime. If some of the frustrations can be ironed out, it could be the best of its genre.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Despite the relatively mixed reception and rapidly dwindling player base post-launch, Ubisoft stuck with The Division and eventually built it up into a rewarding and diverse RPG shooter. It really does feel as though the studios that worked on The Division 2 have taken the feedback to heart and have poured it into the sequel, enhancing almost every aspect we've experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;All of the good traits from the first game have been amplified, and the changes feel like better implementations of the original ideas. The endgame content is substantial, and the introduction of classes so late in the game changes things enough to make the experience feel renewed. Add to that the promise of lots of free future content, and you have a loot shooter that is well worth your time.

The Riddles of the Ivory Keys Box,"Splintershield here, folks. Since the betas, there has been [this peculiar box](https://imgur.com/K0AldFC) inside the White House, requiring 8 ivory keys to open. 

On Tuesday I solved one of the cyphertext riddles ([here are eight that have been found](https://imgur.com/a/w03p1Ml)) when I was at Level 8. A Hunter spawned and killed me immediately. I got to level 14 and squadded up and we re-spawned the hunter and tried, for almost two hours, to kill it. Unsuccessfully.

But when I heard that killing a hunter got you a mask AND an ivory key, I got VERY excited.

I pushed for Level 30, taking out the strongholds and getting to the endgame to get my specialized weapon. This time, when I encountered hunters, I was ready. But I have only been able to get six of the eight so far. 

This post is an effort to explain what I know and what I suspect and see if anyone else can add to the knowledge. 

First, not all hunter-kills are equal. To unlock the Ivory Keys Box, you need a hunter kill that drops an ivory key AND a mask, not just a mask. I see many videos and posts about getting the masks, and many people wondering why they have all the masks, but not eight ivory keys. 

To my knowledge, only eight cyphertexts have been discovered, so far. Six have been solved, but, of the [cyphertexts here](https://imgur.com/a/w03p1Ml), the 5th and the 8th texts have not been properly solved. 

On the fifth text, ""UNITE"" - the solutions that have been posted lead to a hunter kill that might give you a mask but no ivory key. The translated text reads:

 SCAN THREE LOST SOULS 

FIND THE TIME TO PAY RESPECTS 

SOULS HONORED 

AFTER DARK RETURN TO FIRST MONUMENT 

AND RELEASE ANOTHER 

We know that pushing the button in the basement room under the Washington Monument shows us a map and that if we follow the map, in order, we can find three SHD agent graves. When you salute at the graves, there is a subtle indication that it has been recorded as your HUD fuzzes up a bit. After finding and saluting all graves in the right order, returning to the basement room and pressing the button puts a big orange ellipse (or stretched circle) on the screen above the button. Going outside when its dark you can see a big orange circle of light on the ground from a lightbulb that has turned orange. But there should be one more thing that we need to do that we are missing! 

I realized that I was taking it for granted that ""first monument"" was referring to the Washington Monument. A search for ""First Monument""s revealed the [First Division Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Division_Monument) \- which seemed VERY appropriate for an easter egg of some kind. Going there, I did find two grave with wooden crosses with SHD watches on them, just like the graves of the SHDS agents around the Washington Memorial. However, the only thing I could think of was to go there after dark and salute the graves - and nothing happened. At this point, I'm stumped. 

As for the eighth riddle, I'm not sure where to start yet, but I have some ideas. The translated text reads:

AGRARIAN TRUCKS 

SIGNAL THE RIGHT PLACE 

THEYLL PUMP THE BREAKS 

ONE F(OR?) ONE  

AIM WELL BREAK THE GLASS 

A GREAT REWARD AWAITS YOUR ASS 

""Agrarian trucks"" sounds like it means farm trucks or tractors, but I can't think of any farmy locations around the map. Yet. ""Signal the right place"" sounds like it could mean a turn signal, like the right turn signal might be flashing? Pump the breaks is interesting because it is spelled ""breaks,"" NOT ""brakes"" - but still don't know what this means. 

Thats all I have for now, will update and edit this post as any more info comes to light, but please share any tidbits you may have found and we will solve these!

"Top 3 Lessons I Learned From Reading ""Capablanca's Best Chess Endings"" by Irving Chernev","Two months ago, I challenged myself to play through one game every day from this great book. 60 games in 60 days. I played through the moves on a physical board often times playing “guess the move” and (to my dismay) rarely guessing the move correctly. This was possibly the most engaging chess book I have ever read. Each day I looked forward to playing through a game from the book. Who would his opponent (aka victim) be this time? What would the opening be? I marvelled at Capablanca’s deceptively simple style of play. Here are some of the lessons I have learned from playing through these endgames:

1. **Capablanca minimizes his opponents counterplay.**  In several games, Capablanca refrains from winning material to instead play a move that minimizes his opponents counterplay. In Capa’s words: “Position first, then material”. Take [Jose Raul Capablanca vs George Alan Thomas](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1316958) for example.  On move 28 Capa plays Be7!!  This renders blacks minor pieces useless!  The bishop is hemmed in by the knight and now the knight does not have a single square to move to!  His opponent decides to sacrifice a pawn just to get his minor pieces untangled!  Or [Johannes Hendrik Otto van den Bosch vs Jose Raul Capablanca](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1316957).  On move 29 - I would be tempted to centralize the King further, but Capa realizes that Whites main source of counterplay will come by pushing c4 so he simply plays b5.  Or [Endre Steiner vs Jose Raul Capablanca](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1004092) \- on move 40 Capa could have taken the pawn with the King but instead he plays Nf3 - denying black from entering the 2nd rank with his rook.  In their [1927 WC Match game 29](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1012544) Move 52 - Alekhine is about to activate his King.  Many people in this situation (including me) would centralize their King with a move like Kd3 but Capa plays 52.Nc6! completely cutting off Alekhines King from approaching the passed D pawn!   How about [David Janowski vs Jose Raul Capablanca](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1064780) \- realizing his opponent would like to free his position by playing e4 Capa simply plays 16. f5.  Chernev's comment on this move is spot on ""Good players do not let their opponents make good moves"".  These are not rocket science moves but they are moves that a weaker player like myself can certainly learn from.
2. **Capablanca sacrifices pawns to activate his King.**  The most striking example of this is [Jose Raul Capablanca vs Savielly Tartakower](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1102104) where Capa sacrifices 2 pawns WITH CHECK just to activate his King (move 35).  How about [Jose Raul Capablanca vs Erich Eliskases](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1040803) with 48. f5! -  allowing the King to penetrate.  Capablanca used the King as a weapon in the endgame.  Capa said that in endings of one or two minor pieces the King should surely be centralized.
3. **Capablanca creates two passed pawns whenever possible.**  [Capablanca - Conde](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1056008) blew my mind.  This game really showcases the genius that Capa was.  Understanding that he was going to be able to create a passed pawn on the G file, Capablanca needs to create another passed pawn.  b4!!  What a move!  Absolutely crushing - the King can not defend both passed pawns.  [Capablanca - Lasker 1924](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1102114) really shows that Capa understood the power of connected passed pawns -  26. Nxf5!  Giving up a piece to secure connected passed pawns!    


I planned on doing my top 6 lessons but fell short on time.  Perhaps I will do a part 2 to this post if people enjoy it.  Cheers,

Muddy Puddles CHIMPS - The Guide (Version 9.0),"#Disclaimers

* This is difficult - it requires precise tower placement/targeting, retrying rounds for RNG, and micromanaging 2 mortars and a helicopter. If you just want to see how hard the micro is, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3-MNQh0CP8) of rounds 95-100. Expect to spend multiple hours.

* This is version 9.0. I have no idea whether this will work in future versions.

#Notes

* Mostly complete video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovV0XSYUecM). Before any **bolded** round, watch it in the video to see what I do.

* Hotkeys! You need midround tower placements on rounds 10 and 15, several midround upgrades, and several targeting changes. Check out [this image.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/454395715834216459/526452820317175808/hotkeys.png) Missing from the image: L ctrl+tab to reverse change targeting and 1, 2, 3, etc for abilities (left to right). If you're on mobile, this is probably going to be harder. I'm not sure, I've never tried playing BTD6 on a phone.

* Mortar micro! You can see a lot of this in the video. To change targeting, select the mortar, press tab, then click where you want to aim. The mortar will stay selected, so you don't have to click on it again before you tab to target again. However, **your helicopter will not follow your mouse after you press tab, so don't wait to click!** Also, **you cannot press Esc to pause when you have a tower selected!** However, Esc will deselect the tower.

* Do not buy extra upgrades! This includes, but is not limited to, extra dart monkey upgrades, pursuit, and extra mortar upgrades (early and late). If you spend more than $28, you may not have enough money for the 0/0/0 dart monkey that is the key to round 100. If you deviate, you're on your own (but I'd love to know what else works if you do!)

* Do not use Wall of Trees (except on 99 when you have to.) If there is money in the trees when you exit out of the game, you lose the money. Remember, you need that 0/0/0 dart monkey.
 
* If some round just isn't working, try messing around with the targeting of any tower that doesn't seem to be doing its job. Compare to the video. It might be RNG, it might be different placement. If you're really stuck feel free to message me either on Reddit or frds#4037 on Discord.

* If you have any question about why I did something, bought or didn't buy a certain upgrade, or anything about the strategy in general, feel free to ask!

All earlygame tower placements are exact, but D1, D2, D3, D4, and S2 need to be near-perfect.

* 6: D1, first. S1, first.

* 7: D2, first.

* 8: should be easy

* 9: S2, strong

* **10**: The hardest round of the entire run. D3, last. As soon as you get the money, place D4 and get it to Strong with the hotkey. If it doesn't work, try again. And again. And again.

* 11: should be easy

* 12: D5, strong

* 13: D6, first

* **14**: D1, D2, and D5 to strong. D6 to last. S1 to strong, then switch to first during each yellow rush. If you're struggling, you may have better luck with D6 on strong or D1 on first. You may need different targeting for each set of yellows.

* **15**: Another really nasty one. S1 and S2 to strong. Build Obyn (on first) ASAP, then upgrade D3 to 0/0/1 ASAP. If you're struggling, switching Obyn between Strong and First may help.

* 16,17: should be easy

* **18**: Dr1, last. Upgrade to 1/0/0 ASAP. Switch to first during final clump.

* **19**: D7, first. Dr1 to first. D1, D5, and D6 to strong. D2 to last. If you fail, try again and hope for better druid RNG.

* **20**: Brambles ASAP. If they don't appear on the left path below Obyn, try again. Don't waste time between 20 and 21 - **brambles can time out, completely screwing you.**

* 21: S1 and S2 to strong. Should be easy, assuming you have brambles.

* **22**: Last really bad round until 99, I promise! S1 strong, D3 first. Buy $16 Obyn upgrade to level 5 for faster shooting. If Obyn doesn't place the totem on the right, try again. If he places it on the right, hope for good druid RNG. Expect to attempt this at least 20 times.

* 23: Brambles, anywhere on the left should be fine.

* 24: D2 to 002.

* **25**: D1, D6, D7 to first. D5 to strong. D2 to 003, last. Upgrade to 013 ASAP. Might need to switch to first midround.

* 26: Don't use the brambles like I did in the video, just wait until 27. D2 to first, S1 to first. Play around with targeting if you have trouble.

* 27: Brambles.

#Midgame

[Mid/endgame tower placements](https://i.imgur.com/Ca7ynLE.jpg)

These placements as exact as earlygame, but you still need to pay attention. Getting those subs in village range is a bit of a squeeze.

* 28: M1 0/0/0, needs to be in range of both villages later. Micro to catch all leads. From now on, move it to the relevant lane each round.

* 29: should be easy

* **30**: S2 to first, upgrade to 2/0/0. All darts to first. Upgrade S2 to 2/0/1 ASAP, then mortar micro to catch the leads.

* 31: D2 (crossbow) to last.

* 32: D2 to first, S2 to 2/0/2 midround

* 33: Brambles on the left path.

* 34: should be easy

* 35: Brambles on the left path

* **36**: 1/0/0 heli, keep it ahead of the pinks. You need to place it where I have it so it can be used for sub intel on 100.

* **37/38**: Place your mortar well. You may have to move it or try again if it misses a lead.

* 39: heli to 1/3/0 ASAP. Blow back those rainbows.

* **40**: Brambles on the right. If left, try again. You need to blow back the ceramics, but if the brambles break them there will be too many bloons and you'll fail. To avoid this, get the MOAB down 1 damage stage, then fly the heli to behind the brambles and let them do the damage before popping the MOAB.

* 41/42: should be easy.

* **43**: V1 0/0/2, place as low as possible. S1 to 2/0/1. Upgrade to 2/0/2 ASAP. Once ceramics come, move the heli up to try to blow them back instead of lesser bloons.

* 44-46: should be easy

* **47**: A1 0/0/0 and V2 0/0/2, both as low as possible. Then, A1 to 3/0/0. You could try placing V2 first but you have to fit A1 in and the 5% extra discount isn't that important. Keep your eyes open during the round.

* 48: should be easy.

* **49**: S1 to 2/0/3. M1 to 3/0/2. Keep targeting ceramics with your downdraft.

* 50: should be easy.

* 51: V1 to 0/2/2. M1 to 4/2/0 midround.

* 52/53: Move your mortar a bit if needed and downdraft the MOAB ceramics.

* 54: V2 to 2/0/2.

* 55/56: should be easy.

* 57: A1 to 4/0/0. Place S3 2/0/3, first.

* 58/59: should be easy.

* 60: S4 2/0/3, first. If you're wondering why I wait, it's so I'm not alch buffing a low level sub.

* 61/62: should be easy.

* **63**: First real mortar micro round. Track each rush, and don't forget to keep your heli working.

* **64**: Next mortar/heli micro round. Keep your subs focused on the MOABs. Brambles won't hurt but aren't needed (you can see mine landed on the left). Might help to put one of the subs on strong.

* 65-70: should be easy

* **71**: S2, S3, and S4 to strong.

* 72: should be easy.

* **73**: Put some subs back to first...I struggled a bit without it.

* 74: should be easy.

* **75**: All subs to first. Watch out for the fortified MOABs! Mortar to 5/2/0 ASAP!

* 76: Laugh as your mortar 1-shots everything.

* 77: should be easy.

* 78: Do some triumphant victory laps with your heli.

* 79-80: should be easy.

#[Endgame](https://youtu.be/oyeruyIIrYQ?t=7)

Superceramic time. This actually helps you, because your mortar can still (almost) 1-shot these and there are less bloons for your heli to blow back. You have to mortar micro every round now, even if I label it as easy. Ignore the fast forward button - it's not worth it.

Before you get to 100, practice your first strike shot. Build 2 strikes and a Tsar Bomba and send round 100. Use one strike and the bomba, then wait until the BAD is [here](https://i.imgur.com/oYmxCLe.png) and fire the 2nd one. This is extremely close.

* 81-84: should be easy. Feel free to start building the stuff I build at 85 earlier - I was saving up to see what the budget looked like.

* 85: S4, S5, S6 all 2/0/3. S3 to 2/0/5. A2 3/0/0. On this round selecting the mortar will cover up the bloons - to avoid this first select a tower on the left, then click the mortar.

* 86: A2 to 4/0/0.

* 87-89: should be easy.

* 90: V1 to 0/3/2. N1 0/3/0 (for intel).

* 91: another annoying left path round. N1 to 0/4/0 ASAP.

* 92: Sabo ZOMGs.

* 93: should be easy.

* **94**: N2 0/4/0. Should be in range of V2, but out of range of A2. Sabo ZOMGs - although I only used one it's fine to use 2 if you use them early. You'll need them for 95.

* **95**: M2 0/0/3, in V2's range. aim at the bend by Obyn. Sabo when DDTs first come, then calmly count to 13 (or watch a clock) and sabo again. The ability lasts 15 seconds, and you can't let it go down. If you get super unlucky with totems you may have to retry.

* **96**: I accidentally edited this out of the main video. Whoops. Video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z72Cg5mPUqs) Move M2 down by the subs, and as soon as you get $10800, quickly upgrade to 0/0/4 and go back to microing M1. Try to get M2 moved up at some poing before the 2nd set of FMOABs. Use both sabos as soon as they come up.

* **97**: V2 to 3/0/2. Glue Gunner 0/1/3, strong. Move M2 to where the ZOMGs pop. Use **1** sabo ASAP. Not 2, otherwise you'll get it back too late for 99.

* **98**: A1 to 4/0/2. First Strike sub 0/3/0. M2 all the way at the entrance. Use 1 sabo as soon as you see ZOMGs (you need this one back for 99)

* **99**: Brambles and Trees immediately. Trees must be on the left and above or across from Obyn. Sabo ASAP. Ideally, the trees should break and give the cash, but as long as you end the round with at least $14055 you'll be able to afford first strike and D8.

* **100**: Buy First Strike. Place D8 for extra sub intel. Keep your mortars and heli on the BAD. Activate First Strike at the last possible second, just like you practiced, and pray to the Monkey God.

"The ""Pile of Sand"" Development Methodology","Found an interesting thing about Anthem and it's development director Alain Baxter. This man was scheduled for a upcoming GDC conference about development schedule and methodology : 

"" Production plans were laid out, and with the use of ""phased gates"" for  content, the team started to build their content. However, part way  through, they realized they were falling behind. The solution? Switch to  a new developmental process called ""Pile of Sand"" and adapt priorities  to fit this new model.   


The result? It worked. By late  production, BioWare had caught up to where they wanted to be and had  something that they were proud of and enjoyed playing. This talk will  discuss the process the BioWare team took to adapt to this new process  and lessons learned for future projects. "" 

&amp;#x200B;

Do we even play the same game ? I mean even if you excluded the technical difficulties (desktop crash, cutting sound, server error...) the game is currently content missing with a poor endgame and bad design decision. For example this week end Hearth of Rage fortress was  impracticable  due to people farming the first two chest and leaving the map for incoming player resulting in a tedious boss fight without chance of legendary loot.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it seems the conference is canceled without explanation. I wonder why ? I am genuinely interested to know how it could turn so wrong during those 6 years.

Fight Club and the Philosophy of Tyler Durden,"  

I just finished reading **Fight Club** for the first time in over a decade, so I'm going to break its first rule.

It’s a cliché by this point, but **Fight Club** really was amazingly prophetic in identifying a few particular social trends/neuroses of the following decades. It was written in 1996, and the more-famous movie came out in 1999, but its core themes were more strongly felt from 2010-today than during the 90s. Some of it is a bit *out there*, but I think the core themes are still very much alive today. 

Here is the philosophy of **Fight Club**, or at least of Tyler Durden, in a nutshell –

   
 

Men are suffering today because they are inherently unsuited for the social demands of modernity. 

Evolutionary, men were developed to hunt, to fight, to kill, to survive only by the force of their own muscles and instinct. They were the providers for their families, tribes, and societies, and thrived in a state of chronic struggle/warfare against each other and nature. Naturally, their bodies and minds developed to reflect this reality, and even down to a neuro-chemical level, they derive value and meaning from such a way of life.

The modern world has completed removed this aspect of life and replaced it with soft, decadent, consumer capitalism. Not only are men not supposed to be violent, aggressive, and driven by their very real biological urges, but they are told that these aspects of themselves are barbaric, evil, and worthy of condemnation. 

Pre-historic and early-historic civilizations were dominated by male norms. Modern society has flipped to being dominated by female norms. Men thrive on competition, conflict, domination, and destruction. Women thrive on nurturing, construction, and development. Modern men have been told to supplant their masculine instincts for feminine norms. 

Consider the typical life path of a modern man. He is told to sit in boring, stifling classrooms for the sake of an education. This will improve his value in the economy.  He is told to sit in boring, stifling offices for money. This will improve his status and credentials. Then he is told to find a woman and get married and stay faithful to her for the rest of her life. This will improve his status further and make him *complete*. Any men who can’t stick to this path - who drop out of school or do manual labor or don’t want to settle down with one woman – is condemned as a *loser* by society. There’s a decent chance he will end up impoverished, homeless, addicted, and/or imprisoned, and no one will care.

There is no room in this life path for the gut-level desires that men *feel in their bones*. There is no victory, no power, no dominance. Everything the man is supposed to do builds towards some sort of higher status, but the gains are illusory. Sure, society dangles the prospect of extraordinary success – it’s possible you could become a Hollywood actor or a billionaire, or a rockstar, but you almost certainly won’t. You’ll just be one of hundreds of millions of generic middle-class dudes devoting your life to ends that you are biologically unsuited for. 

At least the more recent past generations had some sort of big societal struggle to give their lives meaning – a Great Depression, a major war, etc. But the modern world is past all that. Everything is stable and comfortable. There is nothing to fight against, so people focus on “self-improvement” as their source of meaning. They read books so they have more knowledge, they eat better food so they’re healthier, and they work out at the gym so they can look better. 

But really this is *masturbation*. It’s a fleeting, hollow attempt to get gratification. It has no real endgame because each individual is a pointless atomized unit. And it’s an inherently *feminine* means of gaining status because it’s predicated on nurturing oneself for the sake of the approval of others. Contrast this with *masculine* means of gratification – hunting a wild animal or defeating an opponent in combat… these are zero-sum games by design. Victory is meaningful precisely because it is based on one party destroying another. 

Modern society has no room for such games. It has only self-improvement, white collar jobs, middle-class marriages - traps that leaves modern men bored, depressed, anxious, lonely, and self-hating of the *real* desires that lay within them.

Fight Clubs, the organizations in the book, are a form of therapy for modern men.

Fight Clubs provide an outlet for modern men to find embody their primal core. There is no hierarchy in Fight Club, no broader objective, no greater status to be attained – there is only you and one other guy wearing no shirt and no shoes who will fight each other with your bare hands until one side is unconscious or surrenders. 

This therapeutically treats modern man’s neuroses in a few ways.

First, it gives man a taste of how he should live. The fights recall the hunting and combat of their ancestors. The stakes aren’t quite as high as losing one’s tribes to slavery or starvation, but the adrenaline and physical danger are perfectly real and potent.

Second, Fight Club is an act of self-destruction to counter the societal obsession with self-improvement. Participating in Fight Club makes men ugly, injured, tired, late for work, and shifts their priorities from the feminine social hierarchy treadmill to a narcotic-like rush of masculine gratification. It reorients men towards their natural state. 

But Fight Club is just the start. Its evolution is Project Mayhem, which I won’t get into because it’s a bit more complicated, but it’s essentially an attempt to enforce the Fight Club philosophy on society as a whole, with the long-term goal of literally “bringing down the system” and returning the modern world to a traditional-primal value structure.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I’m not actually endorsing this philosophy. I don’t think getting into bare-knuckle fights with strangers every week is a good idea. But I do think Tyler Durden’s philosophy hits at real issues that all men feel to some degree. I think it’s possible that men feel unfulfilled without a real sense of stakes in their lives, like the sort that mortal combat would have given them in the past. I do think that a certain percentage of men will never be suited to classrooms and white-collar jobs, regardless of their benefits. And I think there is something mentally gratifying about trying to get in touch with some of their more primitive aspects of the self, within reason of course.",TheMotte,75,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/b2f8hx/fight_club_and_the_philosophy_of_tyler_durden/,,Dormin111,b2f8hx,/r/TheMotte/comments/b2f8hx/fight_club_and_the_philosophy_of_tyler_durden/,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/b2f8hx/fight_club_and_the_philosophy_of_tyler_durden/,111,2019-03-18

Reckoning Weapon Drop Rates,"This needs a buff.  The reckoning is probably one of the best activities Bungie has made.  The ability farm endlessly is great.  Being an endgame activity however, the drop rates currently are very very bad.  I believe. That people farm this activity to get specifically rolled weapons.  The gameplay loop fits this type of farming perfectly.  However, you get really demotivated when the drop rates are as Low as they are.  I can see myself and many others farming this activity endlessly if the drop rates are boosted.  Given that you have different weapons that can drop from this activity, the possibility for variation if you’re chasing a specific perk combination is very high.  Therefore, it should rain down weapon drops to incentivise farming.  We farmed Tier 3 a whole bunch this weekend and not a single one of us received the handcannon.  This is just not right.  

TLDR:  make Reckoning weapon drops more frequent to incentivise farming for that god roll you’re chasing.",DestinyTheGame,64,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/b2cuin/reckoning_weapon_drop_rates/,Bungie Suggestion,Corgoos,b2cuin,/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/b2cuin/reckoning_weapon_drop_rates/,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/b2cuin/reckoning_weapon_drop_rates/,33,2019-03-18
Knight's Gear Guide for the Dummies,"A rough guide of the current gears that actually matter. I'll be covering shields and weapons another time just because I feel like it's a whole different discussion. 

HELMETS

8-299 Zaoan Helmet: it has no level restriction, 5% physical reduction and 1 slot. Staple for low to mid leveled knights. 

8-299 Demon Helmet: although it reduces less damage than Zaoan Helmet, a lot of higher leveled knights prefer the 2 slots over the 5% physical resistance. This can carry you until level 300+.

8-299 Dwarven Helmet: similar to demon helmet, except it blocks more than demon helmet once you start receiving more than 200 damage an attack. 

150+ Prismatic Helmet: a great helmet to just carry around so your imbued items do not tick. 

300+ Falcon Coif: endgame gear. Blocks less physical damage (miniscule) than zaoan helmet, but trades it in for 10% fire protection, + 2 distance, +2 shielding and 2 slots.

ARMORS

8-119 Magic Plate Armor: no level requirement. Solid 17 armor and 2 slots. Good until level 120.

8-119 Dwarven Armor: skippable. Blocks more than MPA when you receive damages above 119. Also at level 119 and below, you're not really fullboxing anywhere that's dangerous enough. But if you have one... Be my guest. 

120+ Prismatic Armor: 15 armor, 5% physical, +10 movement speed, 1 slot, and very affordable. Good to have around until 200. 

200-299 Ornate Chestplate: most high level knights still use this because of how rare and expensive falcon plates are. It's a prismatic armor on steroids. Only reason to use prismatic armor now is if it helps you reach a speed break point. Good until 300+.

200+ Elemental Cuirass/platemail/hauberk: Good to carry around to prevent imbues from ticking. Also very usable in team hunts if your druid can heal you enough. Only armors with melee skill modifiers. 

300+ Falcon Plate: ornate plate is 2003 Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Falcon plate is him at 2018. (Just google it if you don't get the reference)

LEGS

8-184 Zaoan Legs: solid choice until level 185.

8-184 Dwarven Legs: basically the same as zaoan legs. 

75+ Grasshopper Legs: if you can hit a speed breakpoint, go for it. 

185-299 Ornate Legs: wear it until level 300+. Beefed up zaoan/dwarven legs. 

300+ Falcon Greaves: the best legs. Physical and ice protection along with skill modifiers? And it's sexy. 

BOOTS

8+ Soft Boots: early level sustainability. Nice to carry around.

8+ Boots of Haste: hit a speed breakpoint for the extra movement speed.

8-69 Steel Boots: solid 3 def. 

8-149 Golden boots: solid 4 def.

8-149 Treader of torment: solid 4 def and lighter than golden boots. Allows you to carry an extra few rings... I'm serious. 

80+ Draken Boots: it's steel boots with movement speed. 

70-149 Guardian Boots: steel boots with physical protection. The holy damage weakness almost doesn't matter. 

120+ Firewalker boots: carry around just incase you are in fire field heavy areas, or doing the Kazordoon walk of shame. 

150+ Depth Calcei: best physical protection boots out there. Still waiting for falcon sandals to come out. 

150+ Void boots: disappears after use, but very useful for places with heavy energy damage. 

RINGS (no charges)

8-49 Horn: 1 armor. Yes that's it.

50+ Butterfly Ring: only real ring to equip when you aren't hunting or doing anything. 

100+ Claw of the Noxious Spawn: more of a gag ring. Use it to remove poison. Unequip it to take damage. 

AMULETS (no charges)

8+ Beetle Necklace: speed breakpoint. But it's only+2, so skippable.

8-74 Ornamented Brooch: 2 armor and tells you what blessings you have if you're too lazy to open up store inbox. 

75-99 Gearwheel Chain: 3 armor.

100+ Foxtail Amulet: 2 armor with 5% physical protection. Good to walk around with. 

150+ Shrunken Head Necklace: +10 speed. Good luck getting one. 

8+ Wolf Tooth Chain: every high level will be wearing this. Increases loot rate drop, so it's important to swap into these before you deal the last blow on boss creatures. Very useful if you're camping Falcon Bosses.

Just kidding.

"[Manga Spoilers] If you had to give one crazy plot twist+prediction at this point in the story, what will it be? For me:","If I had to give a plot twist at this point in the story:

Eren activates the coordinate with Zeke and screams, but the walls remain stable. Instead, mindless titans outside of Paradis island are shown to be emerging out of the ground. It is revealed that there are countless mindless titans sleeping under the ground (like our Ymir was for 60 years) all over the world, placed there by the old eldian empire wherever they ruled, in case if the world attacks them in future, ready for the command by the Founding titan, which has no limitations to the range of its scream. It turns out that this fact was learnt by Eren through the memories of Warhammer titan and Eren wanted to release them instead of wall titans, as wall titans could've destroyed Paradis as well, up to some extent due to their rumbling.    
The world will cease from attacking Paradis as they'll have no choice but to surrender due to mindless titans around them waiting for an order, and Paradis will be safe from harm for the moment. If Eren does wants to combine the 9 titans in one for the endgame, he'll use this threat as a bargaining tool against the world and Marley to hand over to him, the remaining warrior titan shifters as prisoners.",ShingekiNoKyojin,54,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/b2mlm4/manga_spoilers_if_you_had_to_give_one_crazy_plot/,Manga Spoilers,wall-e200,b2mlm4,/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/b2mlm4/manga_spoilers_if_you_had_to_give_one_crazy_plot/,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/b2mlm4/manga_spoilers_if_you_had_to_give_one_crazy_plot/,64,2019-03-18

[OTHER] Can the MCU's 2019 box office surpass 2018?,"The MCU had 3 films in 2018: Black Panther ($700m DOM/$1.347B WW), Avengers: Infinity War ($678.8m DOM/$2.048B WW), and Ant-Man and the Wasp ($216.6m DOM/$622.6m WW). That's a total of $1.596B DOM/4.017B WW. 

At the beginning of the year, I askled the same questiom, and the consensus was that most thought beating 2018 domestically was unlikely, while beating it worldwide would be tough, but not impossible (consensus was split). That post can be found here:

Now, with Captain Marvel on its way to well over $1B worldwide and $400m domestic, has the consensus changed? I still believe that Endgame will make a similar amount as Infinity War, so the question once again is whether Captain Marvel and Spider-Man: Far From Home can combine to make more than Black Panther and Ant-Man and the Wasp (which would be ($916.6m DOM and $1.97B WW). 

Do you think that the MCU's 2019 slate can outgross their 2018 slate domestically, worldwide, both, or neither? I personally still think beating 2018 domestic is unlikely, but beating 2018 worldwide seems likely now IMO.

Kyrie: Let's Make Her Playable,"Alright, so you have Kyrie from DMC4, right? Probably the least interesting woman in the entire series, is about as developed as wet bread, and has no real outstanding character traits besides ""is nice"" and ""Nero loves shouting her name."" She exists only as motivation for Nero's adventure, and is generally considered one of the worse characters in the series.

This is not remedied in DMC5, where her role is so small that she doesn't even get her own character model. Kyrie exists only as a voice that's always off screen. One of Niko's notes on Kyrie gushes about her and wonders how the hell Nero landed someone like her, but besides a touching moment in the endgame, there's nothing there for her.

So in the eventual DMC6, Itsuno and the devs over at Capcom decide to try and course-correct Kyrie, by making her one of the main playable protagonists of that game.

"[NEW] Captain Rikoris showcase - 3-man Azimanak 11, Arena PVP, first impressions","Greetings Community!

Back at ya with another Hero showcase... Captain Rikoris! Based on my own initial testing, Captain Rikoris is another ""jack-of-all-trade"" type of utility dps unit. He's not much of a damage dealer but rather his kit brings a lot of utility to team comps in both PVE and PVP. He's one of those heroes that seems to do a lot, but you don't really notice all he contributes unless you really understand his kit (similar to f. Kluri &amp; Tamarrine). Since i fully cleared raid for this week and completed all of Abyss, I only got to test him in the new Hunt 11 and the Arena.

&amp;#x200B;

**Azimanak Hunt 11 - 3man Auto (Tamarrine, Bellona, Captain Rikoris) : stats &amp; gear at end of video**

[https://youtu.be/\_bvAQuPPzo8](https://youtu.be/_bvAQuPPzo8)

In this fight, Captain Rikoris brings a strip for the dreaded BERSERK buff, def break on his S1, lowers skill CD &amp; speed buffs the team which makes everyone move a lot quicker and cycle through CDs faster. He performs similar to F. Kluri in this fight (though i have not invested molas into him, so his strip and def break are less reliable than kluri). TBH, I think F. Kluri does a better job here for a 3-man comp because she S1 often which is more opportunities to trigger dual attack with Bellona, in addition to her reliable debuff/strip. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Arena - Challenger League : stats &amp; gear at end of video**

[https://youtu.be/q\_VLeqFBCMI](https://youtu.be/q_VLeqFBCMI)

I built my C. Rikoris with immunity and high HP because I don't have any CR initiators (ml rose, schuri, roozid), so my team is built to be a 2nd-turn team comp. C. Rikoris is decent in arena, his AOE strip helps to peel off pesky buffs that can effect the enemy's performance. His 75% chance to stun highest CR enemy is also clutch for really throwing off the opponent's rotation and can sometimes save one of your team mates from death. His damage is just okay, but i don't think he is supposed to be a heavy dps unit, though at the time of this video i haven't maxed my skill tree. He is supposed to do heavier dps on dark units so I will test this once skill tree is good.  Speed &amp; -1 CD on his S2 are great for your teammates as well. Overall a decent utility hero with disruptive mechanics and can be quite tanky if built right due to his ability to self-sustain with a super high self-healing on S3.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

I'm at a point in the game where I have enough units to complete all endgame content, so now I'm just building ""luxury"" units to fill niche roles or ""husbando/waifu"" units purely because I love their visual design. Captain Rikoris is a refreshing addition to the game, certainly not game changing but fun to play with the right team comp. I would NOT recommend investing in a C. Rikoris unless you're super END END game, as there are a lot more worthwhile units out there that can fill the 4th team slot with more useful kits. Right now, he seems more like a ""luxury"" unit rather than necessity. His kit is niche to use vs dark enemies and flexible utility/dps in PVE content, but he doesn't seem to be essential unless you invest molagoras to improve his strip/def break effectiveness. With all that said, I really do enjoy using C. Rikoris because my favorite Hero is Tamarrine and he compliments her need for speed and CD reduction perfectly, enabling her to be even more broken than she is :).  I'll do more testing in Guild Wars and Raid in the upcoming week.

&amp;#x200B;

HAPPY HUNTING!!!

[Marvel] The destruction of the Infinity Stones will result in mutants entering the MCU,"**\*\*Spoilers for Captain Marvel and Endgame speculation\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

In Captain Marvel, Carol destroyed a power source that was connected to the Tesseract which we know housed the Space Stone and the destruction of that power source resulted in her gaining powers.  Avengers AOU was deliberately vague about how Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver got their powers, just that the Mind Stone ""unlocked some latent abilities"" to avoid saying it activated the X-Gene for rights-issues.  

&amp;#x200B;

There is no conceivable way that the Infinity Stones could remain in  universe post-Endgame, so I think that their destruction will give powers to people across the universe, with Captain Marvel setting a precedent for that.

One interaction that I'm very excited for Endgame (SPOILER),"After watching Captain Marvel, I honestly can't wait for the interaction between Thor and Captain Marvel..... Why? Well, let me explain why. (No, it have nothing to do with them being super powerful being)

Beside Nick Fury and Talos, Every men that Carol Danvers encounter were not friendly toward her at all and all of them including her own father always put her down with words like ""You can't do that because you're a girl"" or ""Girls doesn't belong in airforce"" and those sexism attitudes cause Carol Danvers to be a person that she is.

In Endgame, I believe every surviving Avengers would initially don't trust her and that's where Thor get up and confront Carol Danvers. Instead telling her awful things like most men from her military day would say to her, he says ""I like this one"" and i believe Thor is willing to give Captain Marvel a chance.

That's my theory on that one scene from Endgame's trailer.

Reflecting on CG before its rotation,"Wrote this in my blog recently, thought I would share it here.

The next Shadowverse expansion Steel Rebellion has recently been announced, and when that drops in a few weeks the next Rotation cycle will happen. Chronogenesis will be leaving the Rotation format so I wanted to talk about the cards that I am going to miss and cards that I am not going to miss, just like my [previous post for Starforged Legends](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowverse/comments/a93qlq/reflecting_on_sfl_before_its_rotation/). Chronogenesis was a landmark expansion for the game. It introduced the 9th class Portalcraft to Shadowverse, which was a very unique craft with a trait based around deck size manipulation and having a Magitek and artificial life aesthetic. CG also introduced the Rotation format which split up the play mode options into Rotation and Unlimited.

Chronogenesis is the only time I can remember when there were actually server issues during expansion launch day. It was really hard to log in and stay there to open packs due to how many people wanted to try the game. It was an exciting time because the game environment was going to look very different from before without cards like Dimension Shift and Rhinoceroach being in the main play format.

The Chronogenesis meta had a very interesting evolution. There were complaints during the first month, but I think people generally enjoyed the meta since it was so different than what we were used to before the format split. Then the nerfs were announced and while people were generally happy with what cards were targeted, most people did not expect how much worse the meta was about to become. Bahamut was one of the most overtuned and complained about cards since RoB, and he was finally changed from a 13/13 to a 9/9 while losing the ability to destroy amulets. People quickly pointed out that while the change was good to allow amulet based decks to thrive, it had a very broken interaction with Tilting at the Windmills, a card widely considered to be a meme from Wonderland Dreams. Daria Rune was found to be relatively strong at the beginning of CG, but was not played much because the archetype had a poor matchup against Dirt Rune. One of the nerfs was to Magic Illusionist(2 health to 1 health) and many people thought it was just a slap on the wrist. But it actually killed the card and the Dirt Rune archetype in general, which allowed Daria Rune to rise up in the meta. The result was a new meta with Neutral Forest, Daria Rune, and Tilting Ramp Dragon at the top.

The final 2 months of Chronogenesis is one of the best examples of how statistics do not tell you everything about how good or healthy a meta is. Let's take a look at a random [Shadowlog report](https://shadowlog.com/trend/2018/12/0/r) from this era. From the overall class distribution, we can see that the best class is Forest(53.7% winrate) while the worst class is Portal(44.8% winrate), which was expected since Portal was working with a much smaller set of cards in this meta. As for the 3 meta defining decks earlier, Neutral Forest specifically is at 54.3% winrate, Tilting Ramp Dragon is at 48.3%, and Daria Rune is at 51.3%. Compared to a lot of the other metas in Shadowverse, these numbers look amazing.

So this should have been one of the best metas ever, right? Well it turns out that Months 2 and 3 of Chronogenesis were one of the more unpleasant times to play SV. What the numbers do not tell you is that all of these 3 meta defining decks were highroll garbage. The difference between good and bad draws was way too high, and so many matches were determined without much player agency. In essence it was a balanced, but unfun meta because the top decks would often just lose to their own draws. It was also very irritating to see Sahaquiel and Israfil being played in almost every deck. The playerbase numbers took a huge nosedive during this time. I know it is anecdotal, but I consider myself a fairly casual player and generally get between 4-5k master points every season from a mixture of doing dailies and playing meme decks. Months 2 and 3 of Chronogenesis are the [only time where I was able to make Top 10k in Master Points](https://i.imgur.com/r2ms5a8.jpg) on the ladder from my normal play patterns.

Chronogenesis was actually a very low power level expansion, but people did not really notice because of how different the game was due to the format split and the addition of a new class. It had a fair amount of cool cards, so I will start with those first!

**Cards that I am going to miss**

*Mysteria, Magic Founder*

The Mysteria tribe and archetype was first introduced in Chronogenesis and the founder of the academy itself was the headliner card. She provides a unique permanent leader effect of adding a +1 buff to all spell damage, pushing for a new Rune archetype based on spell damage(in contrast to effect damage, which is what Dirt Rune does). The Mysteria archetype was unfortunately half baked as many of the good burn spells rotated by the time of Chronogenesis, and the other Mysteria followers from this expansion were complete garbage. Not only that but one of the main ways of getting burn spells was through RNG effects from Mysterian Knowledge and Hanna. Can you believe that they introduced this archetype without Mysterian Wyrmist, who would show up in the next expansion?

The Mysteria archetype floundered for several metas, and finally became competitive with Omen of the Ten's mini expansion. However by that time the archetype had transformed into something completely different: the Founder herself was dropped, the deck relied less on burn damage and more on big tempo from cost reduced followers. The original slow burn style of the archetype merged with Earth Rite Rune and became competitive in Altersphere. Who would have expected that Mysteria Magic Founder would get kicked out of her own tribal deck and become Dirt Rune's savior?

I am going to miss her a lot as Dirt is one of my favorite decks to play in the game. One of the better designed leader effect cards since you cannot always afford to play a 5pp 4/4 with no immediate effect. Great art and one rare instance where I prefer the English voice to the Japanese one.

*Arthur, Knight King*

This card has gotten a fair amount of complaints in the past, but I really like his design and think he is an exemplar of the Swordcraft class identity. Sword is a class that should be about playing for the board, and Arthur is a single card that creates a board. He is very similar to Otohime, another card that was complained about a lot during the first 2 metas for Shadowverse. But I think Arthur is much much better designed.

For one, he comes down one turn later which makes a huge difference in metas where Sword has a consistently strong curve. He also imposes a few deckbuilding restrictions to get the most out of his effect. Arthur Sword decks are less aggressive in general since they are discouraged from playing 1 drops. They are also discouraged from playing 2 drops with strong fanfares, like Oathless Knight who also happens to be a card that would fit in an aggressive Sword deck. Then there is the choice of whether or not the Sword deck should be running exactly 4 different 2 drops to get consistent Arthur pulls, or if it is worth running more for the lower curve at the cost of Arthur consistency. There have certainly been metas where Arthur might have been too strong, but I think he can definitely be unnerfed now.

*Summit Temple*

The amulet version of [Arch Priestess Laelia](https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/101731020?lang=en). The idea of converting health into attack points has existed since Shadowverse launched but was not competitive because Laelia was expensive at 6pp, and the effect required her to stay alive. Summit was a more reasonably priced version of the effect that made a Midrange version of the archetype competitive, where you would build a board of low attack, high health followers and make them dangerous for just 1pp. There was a reasonable amount of counterplay to it, since forcing trades or lowering health would directly affect how much damage the followers were doing. I am a huge fan of Divine Spirit Inner Fire Combo Priest from Hearthstone and this is the closest thing we have gotten to that style of deck in Shadowverse. Sadly Summit Haven has not been competitive for some time. I would really like to see the archetype get a functional reprint of the same effect because I had way more fun playing it than any other Haven deck in the Altersphere Rotation meta right now.

*Death Dragon Caller*

The Burial Rite/Reanimate Shadow mechanics and archetype were formally introduced in Chronogenesis. Unfortunately most of the cards that got printed in SV with this keyword would either be poorly designed or underpowered. Death Dragon Caller is one exception where I feel that the card was at an appropriate power level. She allows Shadow to potentially cheat out a huge follower for less than its original cost, but it happens on Turn 8 which is much more reasonable than an effect like old Ceridwen. The English voice acting for this card is also AMAZING. Casey Mongillo(the voice actress) even made a [Reddit thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowverse/comments/920af4/i_am_death_dragon_callers_english_voice_actor_and/) a while back!

*Hamelin*

Really feels like this card should be evergreen. Portal has had many different decks since its introduction in Chronogenesis. But no matter which deck you were playing, you were practically guaranteed to see a few copies of the pied piper. Hamelin provides a very simple but powerful effect: for the cost of playing an understatted 2 drop, you can duplicate any 3pp or cheaper card in your hand. In Artifacts, the best way to use him is to make copies of Analyzing Artifacts for more draw and in Puppets, there were a ton of good targets including puppets themselves and strong puppet generating cards like Flower Doll. Hamelin is an amazing utility card who also embodies the Portalcraft class identity of replication and artificial life. I am going to miss him a lot especially for the fact that having animated Hamelins essentially allows you to animate any other 3 cost or cheaper follower in your deck. One of my greatest accomplishments from Chronogenesis is opening up a full playset of animated Hamelins.

*Icarus*

Another card that feels like it should be evergreen. Icarus is a 2 drop who shuffles 2 Ancient Artifacts in your deck. She has a very powerful evo effect of drawing an Artifact from your deck. However there are times where it is best to not play her early because as Artifact Portal, if you are looking to draw a specific card, then putting 2 artifacts that do not cycle themselves into your deck makes it harder to find that card. Out of the initial 4 artifacts, Ancients were the best one for board control purposes. But it turns out that Ancients not being able to replace themselves like the other 3 artifacts was a very real drawback. Icarus has some cute art and I am a huge fan of her English dub voice. The exaggerated valley girl accent is hilarious. I also like how her flavor text and death voice line reference the Icarus from Greek mythology.

*Acceleratium*

The glue that holds Artifact Portal together. This archetype has consistently been one of the most affordable competitive decks to play since its introduction in Chronogenesis. It was also a great archetype for new players to learn the game with since it was a board based deck with a high skill floor and skill cap. Giving your artifacts rush to control the board was so important to the deck functioning and also contributed to many Epic Sax moments in the game's history. There was also a decent amount of counterplay to Acceleratium once Brigade of the Sky hit since Seraphic Blade provided a strong Neutral answer to low cost amulets. Artifact Portal and the class itself is about to experience a huge change once the next Rotation hits. While I doubt that Artifacts will die off completely, the archetype will likely never be the same again without Acceleratium.

*Cards that I am glad to see go**

*Azi Dahaka*

One of the biggest disappointments from this expansion for me. Chronogenesis introduced Rotation to the game and we all wanted to see classes do different things. Genesis Dragon rotated... but Azi Dahaka ensured that Dragon was still going to have the exact same endgame of playing big Storm followers. The cost reduction effect of Azi was pretty highrolly: since Oracle can be thought of as a cost reduction card in giving you more mana in later turns, that meant that Azi got its cost reduced twice if it was in hand during the evolution turns. Disgusting card, quite happy to see it go away.

*Insect Lord*

A card that has consistently been a core 3-of in every single Forest deck in Rotation. Insect Lord is kind of like a powered up version of Elf Child May. May has the nickname Demon Baby May in the Japanese community which reflects what many people feel about that effect. Insect Lord is a strong, but not overpowered card. In many cases, the RNG of its Fanfare can be mitigated by trading before playing it. However there are lots of other cases where the Forest player has to hope to get lucky, and this kind of RNG that affects the board always creates a negative experience for one player. Looking forward to seeing this go away so that Forest can get some solid non-RNG based removal.

*Aiela, Dragon Sword*

Similar to Azi Dahaka, just another gross Dragon card that ensured Dragon would never change. Tempo efficient ramp is a mistake.

*Mysterian Knowledge*

Low key one of the most broken Runecraft cards ever. It does not look impressive at first glance, but there is a very good reason why it was the first card in SV to get emergency nerfed(in Unlimited), just a mere 5 days after the 1st scheduled nerf date in the Chronogenesis meta. Golem Assault from Wonderland Dreams was already seeing a lot of play due to providing double spellboost from a 2pp card. Mysterian Knowledge was even better as it gave the same double spellboost for 1pp. And anyone who has played Spellboost Rune knows how strong 1 cost spells are.

Later on when the Mysteria archetype fused with Spellboost during Omen of the Ten, this card became even stronger as it performed double duty in that deck. It was the only card to provide both a double spellboost AND a double Mysterian cost reduction for Miranda/Anne, along with adding 2-3 to Anne's Sorcery damage. Everyone who has played SV during late OotT or Altersphere has experienced the early Mysteria board highroll. The vast majority of the time when that happens, it is because the Rune player drew into multiple Mysterian Knowledges. The RNG of this card is also pretty infuriating sometimes. While both of the spells generated are good, there are absolutely matches where not rolling Missile drastically changes the outcome of the game. Would prefer to see less RNG based cards like this in the future.

*Mech Wing Swordsman*

A card commonly played as curve filler in Artifact Portal. There is nothing particularly strong or notable about the card, but I greatly dislike him because of the RNG. Generating expensive artifacts early on is awful when you play as the deck, and it is super tilting when you play against Artifact and the enemy Mech Wing just happens to create the best artifacts for the situation. Even when more reliable options like Angel of the Iron Steed are available, Mech Wing still ends up being better because having something to play on 2 is so important in this game.

*The Bloodcraft cards*

Oh my god, this expansion was such a dumpster fire for Bloodcraft. The fact that Savage Wolf is probably the best card for the class says a lot about the quality of CG's Blood cards. I will never understand why Blood Drinker's Brand still does 4 damage if you target your own follower for the Drain effect. I imagine Blood will be in a much better position going forward without Chronogenesis weighing it down in the Rotation meta.",Shadowverse,24,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowverse/comments/b2g6nu/reflecting_on_cg_before_its_rotation/,,silentforce,b2g6nu,/r/Shadowverse/comments/b2g6nu/reflecting_on_cg_before_its_rotation/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowverse/comments/b2g6nu/reflecting_on_cg_before_its_rotation/,13,2019-03-18

**ARK: The Story**  
**Part Four: Extinction's Salvation**

&amp;#x200B;

*Prologue: She Who Waits*  
*(Extinction Chronicles)*

&amp;#x200B;

Here, in the shadow of extinction, the mysterious She Who Waits speaks to you, the player. Specifically you, and the others she speaks to, for she does not let these messages just float about for anyone to find. She encourages you to embrace two aspects of humanity: violence and kindness, if you are to stave off the impending doom. For all the survivors, before and after, are part of the equation to save the Earth, or let it die. Time is irrelevant to She Who Waits, she exists outside of it, and uses math to determine the future for the survivors. She Who Waits admits she has no control over humanity or the System of the ARKs, all she can do is make small suggestions that, over time, create humanity's saviors: the Survivors, the Ones Who Try Again. All the guardians you face are tests, but unending tests. The System is broken and will never deem anyone worthy of passing, so it will test you until you fail. When something has a 1% chance of failure and runs 3 times, the odds of failure happening are low, but when something has a 1% chance of failure and is run thousands of times, failure is inescapable. The System's failures are mounting and it is entering it's death throes. As it dies, the monstrosities of the Guardians and the extraordinary additions such as Wyverns and Rock Drakes, will become normal until the entire System falls. She Who Waits can not do this for you, she exists, but not in a form like you. You are Earth's Salvation. When you fall, She will be there to catch you, but you must survive on your own. She encourages you to seek shelter in the Great City and the smaller versions of the ARK's around, the prototypes. This is where the System was born, and this is where it will end, where it will all end. Just as humanity drove the neanderthal to extinction, here now is the time for this new species, Homo-Deus, to drive humanity to extinction. It all hinges on your homecoming, on your wit and will to survive. Death is inevitable, but perhaps something new can blossom there.

&amp;#x200B;

*Earthfall*

&amp;#x200B;

After hijacking the Aberrant ARK's teleporters, the remaining survivors arrive on a decimated planet's surface. They've brought with them tools, weapons, and tames, though many are dismayed by the post-apocalyptic state of the planet. Santiago confirms the planet is in fact Earth, with Helena deducing the ARKs are repairing the Earth's atmosphere. She also confirms that he and his group are the most advanced humans she has met on any station, he deduces that this apocalypse happened not long after his time. He reveals that space travel wasn't impossible during his time, just difficult due to politics. Santiago also notes that there is a massive amount of element on Earth, far, far more than there was during his time. Then, suddenly, it all makes sense. Every time technology that runs on Element is used, it emits a few particles back into the atmosphere, which settles into the soil to regrow. Element is like a plant in this way. The only way, Santiago deduces, for element to have expanded this much would be a century of open warfare using element-powered weapons -- weapons he created -- making him responsible for this wasteland and what lies just on the horizon: giant monsters that dwarf any of the Guardians he, Helena, and Mei have ever seen.

&amp;#x200B;

And how do you fight these monsters? Giant, bi-pedal mech suits.

&amp;#x200B;

Santiago hammers out the designs: giant mech suits with TEK guns in one hand and a laser sword in the other. Each mech also has the ability to switch out different modifications: a shield-projector forcing close-quarters combat, a long-range cannon, and shoulder-mounted missile-launchers when ""you want to say 'to hell with this thing in particular.'"" Combined, four mechs will merge on the atomic level to create what he refers to as a ""Mega-Mech."" It's as tall as the King Titan, and devastating. There are two forms of piloting: Beta, where the Mek mimics the pilots movements, and Alpha, where the pilot can control every precise detail of the Mek's capabilities, though he admits no one in their group is expert enough to actually control it on Alpha level. Santiago selects four pilots: Mei-Yin, Helena, a jock named Kazuma, and Santiago himself. Mei-Yin is still grieving for Diana, and as Santiago notes, she seems to loop back around to anger whenever she engages in battle. Helena intrigues him though. Her nervous system integrated better than perfectly with the Mek and Santiago theorizes she could open a neural pathway with more advanced technology. However, half a day before the MEKs are ready to go, the Titans find the survivors. They march on Camp Omega and Santiago, with the only operational MEK, leads them off on a chase to give the others time to escape.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Final Answers*

&amp;#x200B;

Before the ambush, Santiago had located a signal that might provide answers about the ARKs and the Earth's current state. Mei-Yin is getting worse, and her constant, reckless aggression almost costs her and the survivors multiple times. After Diana's loss, she feels like her life has little meaning other than to protect the remaining survivors. When the group decides to vote on whether to journey to the signal, Helena votes for while Mei votes against. As the two debate about it overnight, Mei says something that chills the blood in Helena's veins: *""You sound like Rockwell.""* Helena, with newfound self-awareness, realizes that she can't allow herself to fall down the same path as the disgraced scientist. Mei also brings up Diana for the first time, and her love for the pilot is so clear, so unlike her. In the end, Mei changes her vote and the survivors head towards the signal. It turns out the signal is a still-powered archive, with all the answers Helena could possibly desire. The ARKs are lifeboats designed to cultivate all kinds of life: flora, fauna, human, and they're supposed to end with the ""Reseed Protocol,"" but something has gone wrong. The Protocol should have been the endgame for the ARKs, but due to the poisoning of the surface, spread by the giant Titans, the ARKs never returned to Earth -- becoming such death traps. As Mei explores on her own however, she discovers an artifact shaped like the implant in her arm, and shows it to Helena. While the artifact doesn't respond to her, it does to Helena, shattering into a concentrated gem of light and flashing a series of images through the Aussie's head. Mei seizes it to prevent Helena from having it. She does allow the scientist to study from afar however. Helena's visions grow clearer and she has recurring dreams about the Tomb of Ascension. Helena's dreams become nightmares however, and she sees Element as a purple hand, gripping the Earth's heart and turning it to stone -- and from those violet fingers rises an army of shadows and four Titans to watch them.

&amp;#x200B;

The Titans have found the survivors, and the Army of Shadows are in tow. Mei-Yin orders and evacuation and the survivors flee, Helena holding tight to the gem of light, which she believes fits into the implant in her arm. A third dream takes Helena as the survivors flee, this one of her ascending a ladder to somewhere above the clouds. The Titans and Army of Shadows swirls beneath her, but can not reach her. Helena, determined to save the group, steals the gem and, during the battle, while Mei is at the mercy of the King Titan, while the survivors lay dead or dying all around them, Helena inserts the gem into her implant. The Army and Titans are left disoriented and Mei grabs Helena, retreating in shame. She cares for her friend, the only one left on the planet except her, as light creeps along her frame like veins. Helena is awake only for a few moments to tell Mei the next step on the path to the Tomb of Ascension before passing out again. The journey is long and takes them into the Ice Dome. Mei reclaims her sense of power and her title as Beast Queen, taming Managarmr and Snow Owls, Velonosaurs. Yet the two friends are threatened again. The Army of Shadows and the sub-titans are on their tail. Leaving most of her pack behind, Mei takes a few creatures with her to clear the Forest Cave. She discovers the Tomb, just as Helena told her she would, and sets Helena inside the Throne. The Tomb does not work as quickly as Mei was hoping, and she seals it, taking up a defensive position outside in her MEK. The Shadow Army attacks for ages, wearing down her ranks while the Titans hold back. Using strategy instead of brute tactics, Mei defeats the Titans, leaving her with only her ruined MEK. She returns to the Tomb just in time to see Helena turn to light, ascending, leaving the Beast Queen the only human left on Earth. Her MEK breaks down in the Wastelands and with no purpose to run or protect, Mei falls asleep. When she awakens, another Titan is upon her and she would have died were it not for the sudden arrival of a second MEK, piloted by a woman with hair the color of a tangerine:

&amp;#x200B;

Diana.

&amp;#x200B;

*Together, to the Future*

&amp;#x200B;

Diana awakes, naked and scared, with a metal implant in her arm. Sound familiar? As she begins to gather the necessities of survival, she wonders if the voice she heard just before her resurrection was responsible for bringing her back. To her surprise and fear, it answers her ""yes."" Diana makes her way through the City, being led by the disembodied voice. Eventually, she stumbles upon Santiago's fallen MEK and manages to get it working again. She follows the voice, desperately urging her to ""help"" and finds the Forest Titan bearing down on Mei-Yin. With her pilot's expertise, Diana makes quick work of the Titan and opens her cockpit, smiling down at Mei and asking ""Miss me, beautiful?""

&amp;#x200B;

After cannibalizing pieces from her own MEK, Diana gets Mei's up and running as well. Despite the Beast Queen's warnings, Diana follows the voice to a bunker far away from the city. The bunker is the control center for all of the ARKs. Here Diana reaches many of the same conclusions Helena did about the ARKs and their purposes, but she also learns more. The ARKs have built in counter measures to decrease Element Toxicity Rates (ETR) around them when they land, but the amount of Element on Earth is far above anything the ARKs can handle and, worse, it's being spread and protected by the Titans. While Diana would usually jump at such a mission as taking out all of the Titans, even she understands its an impossible task. But both she and the voice take interest in a location called ""Arat Prime"" on the other side of the globe. Mei and Diana start out towards it, but are turned away by the appearance of the King Titan. Knowing that they can't run forever, Diana elects for the most badass approach to the situation one could think of: assemble the MegaMEK. They return to the sight of the massacre and Diana nearly loses her composure, but she muscles through and she and Mei assemble the MegaMEK. Despite being designed to be piloted by 4 pilots, there's only two survivors, one of whom is from Ancient China. Diana assumes all controls except the sword arm, which Mei pilots, and the two head to battle. They carve a giant ""X"" into the King Titan's chest and send it running. After burying their comrades with honor, Mei-Yin of Yi, Beast Queen of the Jungles, Depths and Wastes, and First Lieutenant Diana Altaras, 82nd URE Fighter Squadron, head to Arat Prime to get answers and salvation for Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

*Epilogue: The One Who Tries Again*

&amp;#x200B;

The System, as She Who Waits explains, was not the only option for humanity's survival, but it was it's primary option. Humans, unlike other creatures, grow attached to where they live and humans need Earth. This City, this Sanctuary, was the pinnacle of human advancement. It was founded on a cache of Element and was built under the watchful eyes of the Ascended, humans who evolved beyond their physical forms. 

Each of the ARKs are powered and monitored by a member of Home Deus, the state Helena ascended to before she became She Who Waits. For every ARK there is a Homo Deus. For She Who Waits, there is the Earth. She has made alterations to the battleground to give you an advantage over the Element and it's King. The MegaMEK she has altered so that only one pilot is needed to control it. She Who Waits is the youngest, the last, and the most powerful of them all. She is the only one who can interact with the System or humanity. Yet, eventually, even gods die. The Homo Deus' very strength, their ascension and ability to see everything, is ultimately what causes their minds to crumble and fade. 

Element is a tricky thing. In small quantities it is an exceptional resource that can push humanity beyond what it thinks it is capable of doing, but there is a thin line and once it is crossed, Element becomes like a plague, corrupting mind and body just as it did with Earth and Rockwell. Element is unlike any other element, not because it came from beyond Earth, but in that it is *alive.* It, like She Who Waits, can not function on its own, but acts through it's proxies. And just as anyone's greatest strength is also their greatest weakness, so this applies to the Element's proxies. They, unlike anything else, were born of the violet fire and contain a part of it's will and conscience. Defeating them would wound the Element. Using their hearts or minds, you can then call the King to your battleground and defeat him -- and in such -- defeat the Element.

Resurrection is what reunited Diana and Mei-Yin, but it was a happy accident from a thrashing of desperation. She Who Waits did not know how she performed the resurrection and it took her a very, very long time to perfect it. Resurrections take energy however, and energy, even Elemental energy, is finite. All of the ARKs energy will be dedicated to cleansing the planet when they land, and the survivor's immortality will be taken from them. 

Ultimately, the future of Earth and humanity lies to you, One Who Tries Again. Find the Titans, defeat them or turn them to your cause, travel to the Heart of the Barren Garden and summon the King. Once you defeat him, call down the ARKs from their safe positions in orbit. Then the Element will lose, then the heart of the Earth will thaw from stone, beating again, turning, allowing for a new sunrise, one She Who Waits only hopes she can see.

**THE END...?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Thank you so much to Studio Wildcard and the community for making this game so amazing. There have been some rough patches (sometimes literally!) and moments when we were sure the game was going to shit, but throughout it all, we've survived! At the time of writing this, it seems Wildcard is finally back on track to re-earning that endearing love we all felt during the first days, when Behemoth Gate walls and movement speed on flyers were a thing.** 

**This story has been a long one in the telling and I feel like it went well. I would love to see where it goes from here. What were humanity's other options to escape extinction? Space colonization? What exactly is Arat Prime and what happened to Mei and Diana? Where did Element come from? Was it an accident that it came to Earth, or did someone send it? There's so much to build upon with the story, and that's not counting the innumerable number of ARKs still to be explored in orbit. Whatever comes next, I am excited to see it.**

**If you have any questions or comments on the story, anything I got wrong or forgot, please let me know! I know there's some more information on Arat Prime in the Sanctuary, but nothing I really deemed relevant for this recap, again let me know if I'm wrong.**

***Thanks for all the support on this story, I've loved putting it down on...err...digital paper and I hope you've enjoyed reading it.

"This won’t happen, but if it did....!","I’m not an idiot I know this won’t happen. Humor me and 
Imagine this:

The final boss battle in Avengers Endgame. The enemy is approaching (perhaps Thanos or something even more menacing) and our heroes are standing around preparing for the imminent threat. They hear the wind of a quintet approaching and the reflector panels turn off to reveal the craft. The plane lands and out comes a recently undusted Nick Fury. Romanoff runs to him to see what he has to say. “I hope you don’t mind” says Nick “but I thought you guys could use some reinforcements.” a hush falls over the crowd 
“I brought in The Calvary” The Avengers theme starts playing and out comes in slow motion hero after hero. Agent May, Quake, Agent Mackenzie, Luke Cage, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Cloak and Dagger... and any other Marvel TV hero I may have missed. 
 The last to exit the jet, however, is none other than Phil Coulson alive and well. Apparently he got dusted and that negated whatever deal he had with Ghost Rider. He says something chippy about being not dead and gives a smirk to Tony. The enemy comes closer. The Avengers take the front lines while our TV heroes back them up. It’s not a long scene but the TV heroes each get a little screen time to show their powers. The Avengers win and after a few high fives and thanks, the TV heroes leave on the same quinjet they arrived in. There is no need to explain who they are, all we know is that they exist, they helped, and Kevin Feige does love us after all.

Theory: Cap is gonna have that dance with Peggy in Endgame.,"Steve Rogers has had a very complex character arc throughout his eight years in the MCU. One of his longest arcs is his connection to Peggy Carter. She’s impacted him in some way in almost all of his outings in the movies. Let’s recap them:

Captain America: The First Avenger - They first initiate their bond when Steve says that he has never danced before and that he’s waiting for the right partner. After lots of romantic tension and deepening their bond, they kiss before he boards the plane that he uses to stop Red Skull from launching a missile towards New York. Steve successfully stops Red Skull but is too close to civilization so he makes the decision to land the plane into the arctic so the missiles don’t detonate. As he heads down towards the arctic, he has one last conversation with Peggy while staring at her picture. They talk about the date that they’re going to have when this entire thing ends and how they plan to go dancing. He crashes and freezes in the arctic until SHIELD recovers him. Steve wakes up and runs into Times Square, disoriented. Nick Fury goes after him, explains what happened and what time period he’s now in and then asks Steve if he’s okay. Steve responds, “I had a date.”

Captain America: The Winter Soldier - Steve visits a Smithsonian exhibit on him and watches a video with Peggy from 1953 in it. She talks about how she met her husband and how she’s eternally grateful for Steve’s sacrifice. Steve opens up the same picture of Peggy that he owns from before he crashed the plane and looks at it. Later he visits an old Peggy whose memory is fading in and out. He tells her that she should be proud of the life that she’s lived. Then she says a key quote: “I have lived a life. My only regret is that you didn’t get to live yours.” She senses that he’s feeling conflicted because at this point in the movie, he’s conflicted about where he stands with SHIELD and what aligns with his morals. Peggy says another key quote: “The world has changed and none of us can go back. All we can do is our best, and sometimes the best we can do is to start over.” After saying this, she gets into a coughing fit. Then she looks up at him as if the conversation never happened and starts talking like she had just found out that he was alive again. She starts crying and telling him that he’s been gone for so long. Steve, a bit tearful now as well, responds “Well I couldn’t leave my best girl. Not when she owes me a dance.” 

Avengers: Age of Ultron - While fighting Ultron with the Avengers, Scarlet Witch uses her powers to mess with Steve’s mind and make him see a vision of what makes him most vulnerable. In his vision, he is back in the late 40s at a post-World War II celebration. His surroundings are borderline unsettling with almost violent imagery while people are partying, such as wine spilling on someone’s white suit mirroring blood and two men about to engage in a fistfight. The war is never really over for Steve and he can never truly have that dance until it is. Peggy appears behind him and asks Steve if he’s ready for that dance. Peggy tells him that the war is over and that they can go home. She tells him to imagine it. Then he turns around to respond to her but suddenly the once lively banquet hall is now abandoned. There is a flash of him imagining their dance but he can’t ever experience it. Steve doesn’t know when his war will ever end.

Captain America: Civil War - Steve is firm on his beliefs in the Sokovia Accords but also doesn’t want to tear the Avengers apart so he’s somewhat open to compromising his beliefs. Suddenly he gets a message from Sharon Carter that Peggy died in her sleep. Steve leaves to find somewhere private to mourn and later attends her funeral. Sharon gets up to deliver a eulogy about her aunt Peggy and recaps her career and how she got to be in the position she did as a woman. A key quote is said in this scene: “[Peggy] said, Compromise where you can. But where you can’t, don’t. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye and say ‘No, you move.’”. The rest of the movie Steve is firm on his beliefs and fights for them no matter what. Even after Civil War and into Infinity War, he is considered a war criminal by the government but he still stands by his beliefs. Steve was always that way in standing by what he believes is right, but Peggy’s beliefs and his love for her helped solidify that in him. 

Avengers: Endgame - The information is pretty scarce about this movie, but Peggy already has a big presence. In the first Endgame trailer, Steve is looking at the same picture of her that he has in the past movies. Which is an interesting piece of info considering that Marvel isn’t giving us much to begin with. But Steve looking at Peggy’s picture is no fluke. In the second trailer, there are flashbacks and voiceovers. First is Tony Stark, reminiscing about his past and showing important shots of his origin. Then important shots of Steve’s origin start playing but instead of doing his voiceover, Marvel decides to play us that key quote by Peggy from The Winter Soldier: “The world has changed and none of us can go back. All we can do is our best, and sometimes the best we can do is to start over.” Ending that quote we’re shown that shot of Steve carrying Peggy’s casket at her funeral from Civil War. 

In Steve’s most important outings, we’re reminded each time that he still loves and thinks about Peggy and that she continues to influence the important choices he makes. But most of all, we’re reminded that he still hasn’t had that dance with Peggy yet. In Age of Ultron, his greatest vulnerability is his wish to have that dance with Peggy but he never can because he was lost in time and his war has never ended since World War II. Steve has never been given the chance to settle down and think about pursuing what makes him happy because he keeps getting caught in conflict. The closest he ever got to doing so was in The Winter Soldier, when he was asking for suggestions to get him caught up. But later Sam Wilson asked him what makes him happy, to which Steve responded, “I don’t know.” Before entering becoming a super soldier in the 40s, all Steve wanted to do was enlist in the army. That’s what made him happy and gave him a purpose. But after becoming Captain America, he found that Peggy would become his purpose after the war until he landed in the arctic and it all went away. Ever since then, he’s been in a nonstop war and fighting it is his purpose. The greatest question is, what will become of Steve when the war he’s been fighting for many years is over? 

Steve’s arc with Peggy isn’t over yet. Marvel wouldn’t litter Steve’s important movies with references to Peggy if they weren’t building to a satisfying end to his arc. So I think that since it seems that Endgame will be Steve’s final outing, he will finally have that dance with Peggy to conclude his long character arc. Having the dance will signify that the war is finally over for Steve and he can settle down for the first time. 

This leaves two ways for Steve’s arc to finally end: he will somehow return back to the time he belongs in the 40s to live out the rest of his life with Peggy or he will die nobly, possibly being the one to end the war and reunite with Peggy in the afterlife to have that dance. I believe that this will be the best way to end Steve’s complex journey in the MCU.

Respect to pro players who can play endgame with the sound the way it is.,I've had up to my eyeballs with public matches but I actually enjoy the competitive games. I've played 10 or so games to get to 50 point solo lobbies which is decent enough. It's usually 20+ moving zones. The only problem is that I almost always die tunneling by somebody replacing the roof above me. How do players hear in endgame? I'm not even shooting and my walls are getting replaced without me hearing it.

"I wrote a full-episode ""script leak"" for the Great Battle of Winterfell","As some people know, I've been writing fan scripts for Season 8. (I'm not affiliated with HBO, this is just for fun / writing practice.) I'm not technically trying to ""predict"" the season -- I'm purposefully ignoring things like episode counts, and I'm avoiding leaks, teasers, and even the official trailers. I'm just trying to make something that \*feels\* believable, solely by extrapolating from Seasons 1-7 (and the books, to a minor extent).

Anyway, I wanted to share that I've just finished releasing the episode where a huge battle takes place at Winterfell (episode 7, out of a planned total of 12). So if you think you might be interested in reading these scripts, now is a good time to start, or to get caught up, because this battle marks the resolution of a major plot arc. From here, we go full speed into the final endgame.

I've been working on this project on the side since Sep 2017, and then full-time-ish starting Aug 2018. Mostly because it grabbed me by the brain and I couldn't help it. But also, I have my own GoT-esque medieval fantasy that I'm hoping to pitch for television one day, so this project has kind of been my self-education on how to do screenwriting. To the best of my ability, I've tried to equal the quality of D&amp;D's amazing scripts, and reproduce their tone and writing style. I'd love to hear your feedback on how I'm doing.

Starks next upgrade to his suit,"Rewatching infinity war, have a thought about something we could for sure see in Endgame about a new improvement to Iron Man's armor. We've seen in the past movies that he always builds and improves based on what he needed at the time. For example, when Rhodey's suit doesn't have a parachute rhodey gets injured– so he builds one into spiderman's suit. 

&amp;#x200B;

In infinity war, tony got stabbed by his own blade. Thanos broke off part of his armor, and stabbed him with it. So,  I think the next improvement we'll see is that he won't be able to be injured by his own armour. He'll improve the AI or Friday so that if any part of the nanotech tries to get used against him, it will just fall apart or physically won't be able to.

Tom Hiddleston tweeted a video I made seven years ago and now I made one for Avengers: Endgame,"""There was an idea...""

&amp;#x200B;

Seven years ago I uploaded a video called “The Avengers: ""Inception"" Style Trailer” to YouTube after noticing some similarities from the trailer to the ones for the film Inception. ([https://youtu.be/jegRxVZZ2ig](https://youtu.be/jegRxVZZ2ig))

&amp;#x200B;

A few days later, I came home from high school to find my phone’s email exploding with new comments from this YouTube video.  I didn’t think anything of it until I went on to Twitter and saw that Tom Hiddleston had tweeted about a video he had found from a creative Marvel fan.  

&amp;#x200B;

It was mine.  He tweeted my video.  On his own.  I didn’t ask him to.  He just found it, and posted it on his profile.  And now my phone could not stop vibrating.  I still smile to this day when I think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it is March, 2019 and Avengers: Endgame releases next month.  I decided to make a new trailer for the final (maybe?) film in this saga.

Can we talk about late game crafting?,"I have been enjoying the game thus far, but I'm struggling to come up with a reason to use the crafting station late game. To be specific, this is in the tier 4 endgame gear grind at ~450 gear score.

For some context, you mainly unlock blueprints by upgrading control points to level 3 or 4, then capturing them. It's a smallish trickle, but consistent with no repeat drops. The vendors seem to sell them as well, albeit through slow weekly resets. On this front crafting plans are much better than the first game. You also have to upgrade your crafting bench as you move up in world tiers, but no issues there. It's basically just a light crafting materials sink. Lastly, weapon mods are part of the crafting table, but only need to be crafted once. No issues with crafting mods.

The problem I do have is when I try to craft weapons and armor. It only lets me craft items of 400-440 gear score. Since armor values and weapon damage scale with this, crafted gear will always be a downgrade to 450 gear score drops of the same item. So whats the purpose of crafting gear if it won't be an upgrade?

You *could* craft and then improve the item as a 2nd step, but the optimization station no longer exists. The recalibration station is nice, but doesn't really address this issue.

On top of that the crafting materials inventory is tiny. You only have enough room to craft a small amount of new items, usually ~10 at most. When crafting weapons you only carry enough materials to craft *5* weapons before having to salvage more items. On the armor side, to craft an item of a specific brand, you need to collect brand crafting materials. These are gained by salvaging items of that brand. You can carry 20 of those max, but each item takes 6 to craft, with each item salvage providing 1 . These limits were presumably put in place to prevent stockpiling large quantities of materials, but is such a small amount as to be irritatingly restrictive.

So I'm at a little bit of a loss. I want to craft items to try and finish out a build, but crafting doesn't seem to actually help me. Since the crafting materials limits are so low, I've just taken to selling all items instead of salvaging them. Except then I just collect money that has little purpose (outside recalibration) because I'm not crafting items. Am I missing something here? Is this something that'll fix itself when world tier 5 is introduced?

"Gunsmithing,character creation and battle royale have no fucking place in a Borderlands game.","WARNING: Huge wall of text incoming so grab a coffee or something :D.



If you didnt already saw it IGN published a new article: 
https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/18/what-we-want-from-borderlands-3

In where the author mentioned that the above mentioned aspects are what ""we"" want from Bl3 ,now most these aspects would totally ruin the game and I tell you why.

1.Gunsmithing

The idea of smithing guns yourself sounds good on paper and would heavily decrease the amount of grinding needed to achieve a optimal build.
But grinding itself for optimal parts is a big part of the endgame. If gunsmithing existed it would need to really hard to achieve or it would need to have heavy restrictions which ultimately would make it pointless and frustrating. If gunsmithing is just 1% more efficient than farming for weapons nobody would farm for weapons and just farm the mats where is the fun at that?


The reason that the grinder is worked so flawlessly in bl-tps , is that most of the weapons didn´t really have a dedicated loot source or that loot source was really low (e.g. luck cannon) adding to this the moonstone perks were really strong and you didn´t have a guaranteed legendary source, in general legendaries were way more scarce in bl-tps and you needed 2 for a guaranteed legendary for the grinder.


Ultimately gunsmithing would decrease the longetivity of the game and only really has a place in games were the main way of farming for equipment is not statisfying at all.


2.Character creation

First of all I want to say im not completely against this idea and it would fit lore wise kinda,however I think it would be a waste of resources heres why:

The Borderlands series in its spirit is build upon unique characters which all feature a unique playstyle thanks to their skills.

These are the characters who you will a spend a ton of time on and if they were too bland and boring the game would suffer as such.

We saw, that in just adding a few more voiceline in bl-tps created more depth to the characters and made it more enjoyable to finish sidequests just to hear the reactions of said characters.

All off this cant really work with a created character first of the skill system would probably be selectable from preset categories so it would maybe be different from character a to b but there will be playstyles which are the same.


Secondly how will be voice introduced? The only way it would work would be to have preset voices which would ultimately lead to blandness or the Fallout 4 phenomen, otherwise there would need to be 
a large amount of voices recorded to make created characters unique and intersting so a  huge amount of resources would be needed for that so they dont appear pale compared to already established vault hunters or newly made vault hunters,to decrease the gap they could make the vault hunters also bland but just why though?


In general I think character creation is just a cheap way to add some customization which isnt really built upon and doesnt really work if you have such good characters like the BL series has.


3.Battle Royale

just no seriously how does someone come up with something like this

guns!=battle royale

we probably get a fun side quest though which references battle royale but a standalone feature wont work at all especially since this would get rid of local coop.

Conclusion:

All in all I want to say that Gearbox shouldnt be focusing on other games and look what made them sucessful simply copying other games successful traits wont work(however looking what went wrong in games which are in a similiar genre is important)  therefore Gearbox should focus on things in which the series can improve upon on like what the community patch did for the game,completely rehauling a well polished game (Bl2) is just way too risky and unnecassary.
However adding new things which dont hinder the core of the game would be greatly appreciated (for example melee weapons pls add gearbox lol). In these cases its really important to listen to the core audience of the game the people who still farm that perfect unkempt harold in Bl2 and not wannabe ""fans"" like the ign author who´s playtime probably didnt even exceed the hour mark.

"To the people complaining about Nightwave. Well, some of you, at least.","Tl;dr &gt;!Elite are not for everyone, and you're not missing much.!&lt;

I'm talking those who say the 2 :   


\-Please no Challenges that require me to use ressources

\-Please no Challenges that are locked behind progression etc.

\-Please Nothing limited in quantity (ie. 5 sorties when there are 9 a Week)

\-Please Nothing that requires me to log-in at specific times.

&amp;#x200B;

Now tell me, what's left? 

I'm genuinely curious about this.

As far as I know what we have left are the followings : 

\-Kill ennemies which resumes to Play

\-Get credits which resumes to Play

\-Jump which resumes to Play

\-Fish in the Vallis

&amp;#x200B;

We basically say **no** to the followings :

Profit taker, Sanctuary onslaught, Sortie, &gt;!Lua, Kuva Fortress!&lt; Forma things (basically, using formas for what they're meant for), Tridolon, Arbitrations, Modular items etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I UNDERSTAND that a lot of people can't do the follwing. But here's the thing, these are **ELITE** Weeklies. It has been said times and times, these are made for long time players that grinded their way through it. I can't tell you how uncomfortable I am when I read ""I am not max rank in Fortuna"". While this is Indeed a problem for Switch players, other ones Don't really have an excuse, or at least, should not be ""hypocritical"".

You might not like it, sure, but **by not maxing fortuna, you're saying no to all the stuff behind it, so why is 5k standing such a big deal suddenly?** That's 25 wolf cred.

The mindset is here : Elite weeklies are here for players that basically have done most of the game and need more or less some kind of challenge. You probs Don't know how much FUN I had during the 1h kuva Survival, it's been months I didn't feel such threat from the game. Meanwhile, there are 2 kinds of players : the ones that just can't play 1h straight, alright, sure, but the thing is, you're supposed to actually earn it, not by just logging-in and play casually. Then there are the people who just can't do it because it's too hard. Alright, sure, but it's not called ""ELITE"" for Nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

You do NOT need the Elite Challenges to reach rank 30, you just want to get here faster, and the problem is, **you except to get here at the same time as people who ""deserve"" it.**

&amp;#x200B;

DE cannot say no to the list above, it's a huge part of the game, and comes in with most (if not all) the endgame content aka ELITE content.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's pretty much all I have to say, it's been on my mind for several days. Just, please, Don't expect to get free stuff without grinding a little bit.

I'll be very happy to hear your side of the story and also add things to the ""what we have left"" list!

"Heal with raw fish? This is a futuristic factory! Where's the bandages, stimpacks or medical supplies?","I've always thought that fish was a nice little item you can use to heal, but it begs the question: There must be another healing item! I mean... what happens if a map doesn't have fish?  


Idea 1:

&amp;#x200B;

I mean. We ONLY have fish! Fish is the only item that gives the player health. Why should we limit outselves to fish? Why don't we get something to help heal ourselves? Like bandages, or medkits or sergical implements. I don't know. We have robots, and a factory, they can surely heal us without messing up...  


right?  


===

&amp;#x200B;

Idea 2:

&amp;#x200B;

Or forgo the traditional medkit or bandage and have ""nanobots"" heal us? Like it's a high tier item that heals for a lot, but at a cost of it being a bit pricey, but near endgame. That shouldn't be a problem. Something like how stimpacks are in the fallout series. Something simple, cheap, but can be produced in high amounts.  


&amp;#x200B;

=====

  
Idea 3:

&amp;#x200B;

Fish has been the only healing item, but it's also a food. Why not add a couple food items into the game? With the sole purpose of it being healing items. I mean. Why not kill biters for meat and make some ribs!  


I thought this idea was cool with the ""Food Industry"" mod, but why not something that isn't raw fish out of the water that can heal us?  


(Not a hunger mechanic like what Food Industry adds. Only something that provides a healing effect like how fish does.)

Props to the FTB team!,"In the recent past I've given the FTB team some stick on here for essentially releasing the same pack over and over. I feel like the team really listened to the community on that when making Sky Odyssey. There's a lot to do here that I've never done in modded before, trying to avoid spoilers. On top of that the pack has a level of polish that I really appreciate. Being able to choose a starting map is a very nice touch. Overall I'm inclined to say it's the best work from FTB since Infinity Evolved, and is definitely a contender for best Skyblock of any version.

[MANGA SPOILERS] Devil theory- The One pulling the strings PART 2,"&amp;#x200B;

[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/b2ieou/manga_spoilers_devil_theory_the_one_pulling_the/) of The One pulling the strings

# The One pulling the strings- PART 2

# IV. Am I Free?

[Am I free?](https://i.imgur.com/n6ZUbxB.png)

My personal definition of freedom carries the core values of [freewill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will) and [choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice), *Freedom is* *the liberty to choose how we live our lives to our at most desires*.

Two months ago [I have discussed how the thematic elements of freedom has become a contradiction](https://i.imgur.com/jiLbRuS.png) to itself in response to the events that are happening in the Marley arc. As I am seeing **choice not being the core emphasis**of the theme. In this report, **I will only focus on the contradictions of Eren’s current freedom philosophy.**

Many fans are against the idea that Eren is being manipulated and believes that he is

acting entirely on his [own freewill and agency.](https://i.imgur.com/QKMdmOU.png)

With the evidence gathered prior and with the conceptual arguments I’ll put forward, I will challenge this scepticism.

&amp;#x200B;

**Eren’s freedom philosophy has become a contradiction over time**

&amp;#x200B;

First of all…Is that the [look](https://imgur.com/MRMaKKp) of a **free man**?

I know that the expression he gave to Mikasa in chapter 112 is the ‘I-am-done-with-your shit’ look… but **Mikasa is certainly onto something**. She is totally wrong about Zeke controlling Eren (that’s a joke itself) but with the evidence gathered to explain Eren’s radical change, it is enough proof that Eren is not acting on his own agency to the full extent.

In fact, Eren’s entire conversation with Armin and Mikasa in chapter 112 was full of contradictions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Contradiction 1: I am “Free”….Cognitive Dissonance at its finest**

&amp;#x200B;

The manga panel of [Eren quoting “I am Free” can be parallel to the Attack Titan quoting that line as he was about to consume Annie](https://i.imgur.com/830Bmtl.png) in the anime…What kind of [crackpot freedom](https://i.imgur.com/ZhdiQLP.png) is that?!

In credence to [NKYWritingStuff](https://nkywrites.tumblr.com/post/181190268763/dont-mind-eren-part-i).

Eren could be suffering from high levels of [Cognitive Dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance). Due to the amount of titans he inherited; the memories and personalities of the entities are exploding in his head. Thats why I suggest Eren is being influenced as a whole, as his thought processes are likely influenced.

An example, he finds a disliking to a particular opinion from someone he trusts, on the other hand he usually trusts that person's judgement, so what does he choose? Does he choose to express his disgust....or does he choose to abandon his disgust and put faith in a trusted friend? His [past self](https://i.imgur.com/6AISBSp.png) is more of the latter option , but as of recent, we are seeing more of the [former choice](https://i.imgur.com/bRg36s4.png). The former could be influenced by his predecessors' memories and the Attack Titan’s aggressive drive.

By the way, I am not saying Eren is wrong to expressing disgust of a particular opinion, he has every right to express how he wants, I am questioning, does he realistically have the full operation in piloting his thoughts? Is he controlling his decisions to a full extent....or is he only making partial choices, where external forces are egging him on. Think of it as peer pressure [in your head](https://i.imgur.com/1cgXMR5.png).

Another prime example of Eren's **Cognitive Dissonance**, is his self-proclamation of his freedom. He claims ""I am free""....yet he is showing desperation and the addiction of wanting to pursue his freedom. [He still looks trapped](https://i.imgur.com/1cgXMR5.png). What type of *free* man does that? He is still fighting for his freedom yet he is 'free'? Its a heavy contradiction if I say so myself. He honestly knows he isn't free, so why has he claim so out of the blue? Thats why I believe that Eren is not of himself because the proclamation is **absurdly false**.

The freedom philosophy he is currently abiding to is the Attack Titan’s freedom philosophy. A dangerous kind of freedom: a type of freedom that can only be achievable if it involves the eradication of all enemies aka the world.

I am not going to dispute about the moral complexity of Time-skip Eren’s actions, the focus is on the influence of his actions and his behaviour: Time-skip Eren has shown himself being ruthless, aggressive and dangerous. His dedication to pursuing his goals now involves many lives being sacrificed ([Liberio civilians](https://i.imgur.com/K8BPRDD.png), [Sasha’s death](https://i.imgur.com/UcsLD1Z.png) and [Historia’s temporary condition](https://i.imgur.com/WtoPOf4.png)). Past Eren wouldn’t think of such a notion as he has shown himself to care about people lives and prioritises them (s[oldiers killed by the Female Titan in the forest](https://i.imgur.com/gopOG8H.png), [expresses his remorse of the dead in the crystal cave](https://i.imgur.com/oFdWWyb.png), [his best friend’s life vs Humanity’s hope \[Erwin\]](https://i.imgur.com/ZFWsl3l.png)). Counter-arguments ‘Eren has grown up/he has become experienced’ is not a good enough justification. Eren’s current dangerous behaviour is being influenced by the Attack Titan as his [lashing out at Hange is proof](https://i.imgur.com/uFOhXrD.png) enough and [conflicted expressions](https://i.imgur.com/Qs1IWqC.png) are further proof that he is having doubts.

In essence, Time-skip Eren has become like the Attack Titan, that keeps moving forward to seek its’ impossible freedom and bringing chaos a long the way.

&amp;#x200B;

**Contradiction 2: “You are being influenced Armin and I am not”**

&amp;#x200B;

Its uncertain whether Armin is being influenced by Bertholdt’s memories and that his own personality has been altered. Me thinks it’s a zilch possibility as there is no given indication that he experienced an episode of memory influxes or a memory of his Colossal predecessors.

His visits to Annie could be just him finding closure and be open with someone who has no state to judge him. The [reaching out his hand to touch her crystal](https://i.imgur.com/3KQkbXO.png)…well that’s concerning. Maybe its a [Gesumin](https://i.imgur.com/TVxg6N2.jpg) moment? Maybe he wanted to boop her nose to unlock memories? Or he is indeed to be [influenced by Bertholdt](https://i.imgur.com/oscNw4j.jpg). What ever the case may be, the main focus is still on Time-skip Eren’s contradiction…and his god damn hypocrisy.

Eren says a shifter can be influenced by memories and that their predecessors can become a part of them. Eren highly speculates that Armin is being influenced by Bert. Putting Eren self-proclamation into the picture, Eren vaguely claims that he isn’t being influenced?

&amp;#x200B;

**Lets look at this** [**chart**](https://i.imgur.com/YSMrFcN.png)**:**

1. Eren holds three titans where as Armin holds one.
2. Armin has Bertholdt and his nameless Colossal predecessors to be influencing his decisions whereas Eren has 8 characters and many more nameless predecessors to be influencing his (Attack Titan predecessors, Frtiz/Reiss Founding Titan lineage, Tybur War Hammer lineage).
3. There is no indication of Armin experiencing memories but there is one case of him exhibiting strange behaviour. His supposed sudden attachment to Annie. Eren on the other hand, has experienced influxes of memory episodes and have been exhibiting strange behaviour.

Who is more likely to be influenced?

&amp;#x200B;

**Contradiction 3: “Ackermans experiencing sudden migraines”**

&amp;#x200B;

Eren quotes:

“*Apparently, once and Ackerman* ***awakens***\*. They often find themselves suffering from\* sudden headaches\*. They say this happens out of the true self trying to resist being forced to protect it’s host. Sound familiar?”\*

Hmm… I am not the first to discover this, but Ackermans are not the only ones to be suffering from migraines, these [‘sudden migraines’ ain’t exclusive to them](https://i.imgur.com/psh3a83.png).

From the picture we can deduce that shifters, royals and Ackermans have sudden headaches when they experience a memory. Shifters get headaches when they try to remember the event prior to their titanisation and memories of their predecessors. Non-shifter royals get headaches when they touch a royal titan or a shifter. Ackermans can experiences memories but on certain times. From what we saw in the manga, the Ackermans only experience headaches when they inhabit painful memories, memories with Eren.

&amp;#x200B;

Eren claims that once an Ackerman awakens \[their true power\], they suffer migraines due to their forced attachment to their host and their true selves resisting attachment….**completely** **untrue**.

In [chapter 63](https://i.imgur.com/8thjq8r.png), Levi told Mikasa that ‘One day’ Kenny had awaken his true power, experiencing a stupid amount of strength. Levi had confirmed to shared the same experience. Kenny and Levi are considered to be stupid strong long before they formed a bond with their hosts. Kenny was a serial killer, who murdered Military Police soldiers, and Kenny taught Levi how to **fight** and how to **survive**. [Levi already awaken his power before his Acker-connection with Erwin.](https://i.imgur.com/r8nm9aS.png)

Levi was implied to be strong and skilful as Isabelle and Furlan witness him taking out thugs all by himself (in ACWNR manga), moreover Kenny left young Levi when he fought a drunkard. Levi’s true power awakening could’ve occurred from there and Kenny was able to witness it, thus he believed his job was done. He taught his protégé **how to survive in the cruel world**.

&amp;#x200B;

Eren uttering that he was the one who ‘commanded’ her is ridiculous. Mikasa’s power awakening could be activated with her own will and instinct: her knowing that in order to **survive in this cruel world**, one needs to **fight**. The strong prevails. ‘[Survival of the Fittest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest)’ fits the theme.

In addition, we haven't seen Levi held his head in pain before the time skip (when he had memory flashbacks of Erwin), supposed it could happen off-screen but I strongly doubt it. Isayama would put subtle foreshadowing (just like he did with the existence of Marley and RBA titan identities). The only time his head throbbed is when he was questioning his doubts in chapter 112, this memory involved Eren (I will explain this in further detail soon).

So why did Eren sprouted such [false information](https://i.imgur.com/oa3IsUr.png)?!

&amp;#x200B;

**Contradiction 4: Ackermans are “Slaves”**

[**""SLAVES""**](https://i.imgur.com/iGpfE19.png)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Grandfather Ackerman’s explanation about the Ackerman lineage and loyalty to the first king in chapter 65 do not match up with Eren’s explanation. Azumabito and Ackerman clans are the two clans that are sent to be ethnically cleansed right? These two clans according to Grandfather Ackerman are said to reject Karl’s vow and said to have no affect on them. Eren goes on saying the Ackermans were designed to be slaves, are were designed to protect the King. Its true that the Ackerman were once loyal to the king but it doesn’t mean they were the King’s slaves. The Ackermans had the power to reject Karl’s philosophy and KFT (Karl's alteration of the Founding Titan) had no power over them.

\- Mikasa inflicted harm on Eren in the second episode of the anime, she even forced bread into his mouth. Forced him to eat, against her host wishes.

\- Mikasa didn’t jump in to protect Eren from Levi’s court beating, If she was so Acker-slave-devoted why didn’t she slam Armin just like she did in chapter 112?

\- Levi ordered Erwin...his host..to **die** (chapter 80). A “slave” making the orders.

&amp;#x200B;

So the question lies…Why are the Ackermans so devoted to their hosts? And why do Levi and Mikasa experience headaches when its memories that involve Eren.

1. Plain and simple: [Love](https://i.imgur.com/xovGAfZ.png). They fallen in love with the host when their host acted compassionate towards them.

Before an angry mob comes after me!

The type of love I am describing is ambiguous, interpret it however you want: Platonic love, bromantic love, romantic love, familial love, you be the judge to decide.

2. Crack theory: Assuming the Ackerman species wasn’t birthed within Paradis nation, Helos could have been an Ackerman as he was the man to have slain the Devil after all. Maybe Levi and Mikasa suffer from unease because their instincts and intuition are telling them to **slay the devil that inhabits Eren’s body**.

&amp;#x200B;

**Contradiction 5: “Armin you’re now useless and Mikasa, I’ve always hated you”**

\- If Armin is so 'useless' how come Eren relied on him to [attack the port](https://i.imgur.com/PzUY6iZ.jpg) (Eren did draw out the plan after all)?

\- Actually….Where did the Yeagerist got their [overthrow the government ideas](https://i.imgur.com/abvuUMn.png) from?

“*Armin’s always been good at thinking up insidious, underhanded plans*”

\- “Mikasa…I’ve always hated you”..…*sure* he does. That’s good ol’ [hate](https://i.imgur.com/QlJBRrI.png) right there.

Time-skip Eren is at the [centre of his own ignorance](https://i.imgur.com/x1ozkAK.png).

All this information is nothing more than self-rebuttal and fallacious logic. Either Eren was actually being ignorant in his roasting session ([you played yourself son](https://i.imgur.com/Kp8UWeX.png)) or [he was pulling façade](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/a59f3f/manga_spoiler_a_coded_cry_for_help/) to break ties with his close friends in order to ensure their safety. The latter is likely.

# V. Abrahamic Symbolism

\- Uri wanted Paradis to be an ‘Eden’, a place of peaceful existence. Similar to the concept of Paradise aka Heaven (chapter 69).

\- The [Divine Contrast](https://i.imgur.com/apNqlMB.png)!

\- Zeke's rebirth is a reference to '[The Resurrection of Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_of_Jesus)', having (to what I assume to be) Ymir Fritz to resurrect him depicts her the Mother of all her Eldian Children and Zeke to be the Lord's son.

\- Yelena worships and visualise Zeke as a God, she could be regarded as one of Zeke’s disciples.

\- Historia has been referred to as a Goddess, God, Angel and has an angelic appearance (fake preview included- Angelic Titan).

\- The Fritz/Reiss monarchy is similar to the English monarchy, for how the royal lineage is traced back being the ‘children of God’.

\- 104th Ymir and 'Krista Lenz’ relationship is [symbolically parallel](https://i.imgur.com/5AiqHWY.png) to the Devil and Ymir Frtiz.

\- The Devil resembles the Attack Titan and from the [visual analyses](https://i.imgur.com/5AiqHWY.png), its safe to assume that Eren is the current ""Devil"". Eren and Historia’s relationship is the exact parallel of the Devil and Ymir Fritz.

\- The apple is a reference to the forbidden fruit that Eve accepted from the Devil. In AoT the [apple represents the contract](https://i.imgur.com/yhSjSwl.png).

\- The [ancient contract](https://i.imgur.com/yhSjSwl.png): Earth Demon/Devil and Krista/Ymir Fritz, Ymir becomes a Goddess and birth the Eldian race. Hence the term, ""The devil's children"" The [new contract](https://i.imgur.com/yhSjSwl.png): Eren who is 45% likely to be hooded-kun forms a contract with Historia, to have a baby to serve their special agenda.

\- Floch the ~~devil worshippe~~r hardcore Eren stan, believes that the Devil be the one to save humanity. In a sense, both [him and Yelena believe that the Yeager brothers are the ones to defeat Marley](https://i.imgur.com/sdjDJ0m.png) (Yelena devoted to Zeke, Floch devoted to Eren).

\- Zeke and Levi could [parallel](https://i.imgur.com/V0gJskI.png) to the story of Helos and the Devil (chapter 113/chapter 99).

&amp;#x200B;

**Who’s manipulating Who?**

&amp;#x200B;

I hear this rif-raf about characters playing 4-D chess and 'Zeke having an 11/10 IQ'.

Nada. Nil. Zilch.

The titans are playing an [intense game of GO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)). A more complex game than chess. The AT is manipulating Eren (to manipulate his pawns- Zeke, Yelena, Floch etc). The KFT manipulates its' royal pawns (Reiss shifters).

So the actual contrast is the Attack Titan and KFT, as both of them are polar opposites.

One sought for *elimination* and *freedom* the other seeks *peace* and *confinemen*t. There is no complete binary of good vs evil, both of their philosophies are dangerous. There’s no such thing as Absolute freedom and true peace is inevitable, KFT had a dangerous pacifistic ideology and the Attack Titan’s philosophy is of course dangerous.

All we know is that the KFT [lost the game](https://i.imgur.com/iisOieI.png) big time and the Attack titan became the champion. Who’s going to be the next contender for the demon? The whole f—king world.

Having a discussion with Survey-Corps-Potato: Although Floch and Yelena portrays themselves as blind devotees to their messiahs ~~and are complete morons~~. Both of the characters can easily manipulate people and sought their own agenda.

I used to belittle them thinking they are the ones being manipulated, but considering how Zeke has shown himself [easily vulnerable to manipulation](https://i.imgur.com/xrfKKb3.png) (‘Eren’ in chapter 115 and possibly Xavier in chapter 114 ) and that Eren is [not in a right state of mind](https://i.imgur.com/04yTXbo.png) (provocation is a strong tool), it is a definite possibility that Yelena and Floch knows more than they are letting on.

Yelena and Floch still believes that [the Yeager brothers are the ones to eradicate the Marleyian empire as they are referred to the divine beings](https://i.imgur.com/sdjDJ0m.png) . Both [Yelena](https://i.imgur.com/MGLsMWZ.png) and [Floch](https://imgur.com/CsctFpH) are possible suspects of being Hooded-kun (orchestrated the pregnancy) . Isayama in an interview has [mentioned](https://www.snknews.com/post/171642598167/additional-translations-from-the-isayama-qa) that Floch will play an important role in the future of the story. Floch’s ‘shh gesture’ is ambiguous – either he is being a twatbag or he was literally *shhing* Hange to not let Eren know about the contaminated wine…”*we don’t want to release the devil Hange..not yet anyway*”.

Consider this, both two characters don't value the Yeager brothers human-selves, they only value the demons that resides in them. Eren is at most value as he inhabits the actual Devil, and Floch and Yelena [plans to release](https://i.imgur.com/sdjDJ0m.png) it into the world. The 'Rumbling' event is my eyes is the release of the devil.

&amp;#x200B;

**Whats even the truth?**

&amp;#x200B;

Kruger words about the ""[truth](https://i.imgur.com/eTXx5fX.png)"" can imply that **things are not what it seems.** People can make up the truth, people can make up the concept of 'God' and the 'Devil' (chapter 88).

The little girl may not be a God, she could have touched the organic matter by accident or was forced to become this ‘ultimate being’.

The Attack Titan may not be an actual Devil, it could be another living being. My ongoing speculation is that the Attack Titan is last of its' homonid civilisation. The reasons for forming the contract it could either:

1. Wanted to continue the survival of its' species (Eldians being a crossbreed species
2. The Attack Titan aims to eliminate its competition to seek Absolute Freedom. '[Survival of the Fittest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest)' is at its core. Hence ‘always moving forward to destroy its' enemies.
3. It’s a major misanthrope and perceive humanity as the plague of earth. The titan may have sought to end the Anthropocene. That’s why it was also referred as the 'Earth Demon'.

Or maybe a combination of all.

The Attack titan hated *homo sapiens* for outliving his titan race. He formed a contract with a little girl (who is another misanthrope due to her poor upbringing). They both agreed (or manipulated one another) to continue the ancient civilisation and to become divine beings.

Some shit stirred up in the Great Titan Wars. A *certain event* enraged the incarnation of anger, the enraged behemoth vows to [destroy the entire world](https://i.imgur.com/k84eDmc.png).

Karl may have foreseen this catastrophic event and sealed his people within the walls in order to prevent the Attack Titan to obtain the Founding Titan's powers (that it once bestowed upon) and to prevent Doomsday- the day where the Attack Titan goes into full rampage and utter destruction.

Why did Ymir Fritz resurrected Zeke? Maybe she opposes the Attack Titan herself as she prophesied Doomsday. Maybe she wanted Eren to use Zeke to end the Titan curse? Or to slay the Attack titan once and for all...or for [Eren to become the new “God”](https://i.imgur.com/8O5ok7k.png) .

We yet to know...

# VI . Wrapping it up

&amp;#x200B;

I bet you sceptics must’ve think I gone bonkers. Well….you are right. I have gone bonkers. I have lost good hours of sleep for this data gathering and report write up, but I have no regrets.

&amp;#x200B;

I won’t be disheartened if the theories listed in this post does not become true, its normal and natural for theories to get debunked but **I would expect good reasoning and explanation for the strange events** that occured in the story: Berserk mode? Why has Grisha’s eyes changed to sanpaku over his stay in Paradis? The Devil and Attack Titan symbolism? How was child Eren able to deduce and successfully kill two men by himself? Why has child Eren experience PATHs before he inherited his titan? Why does Time-skip Eren quote “I am Free”, just as the Attack Titan did during berserk mode?

&amp;#x200B;

Isayama has [referred](http://fuku-shuu.tumblr.com/post/164182335102/snk-character-directory-isayama-hajime-interview) to Eren being a ***slave to the story*** and being ***dragged*** by it. Eren being 'dragged by the story' is him being dragged by the fate of him being the Attack Titan.

&amp;#x200B;

Armin [triggering](https://i.imgur.com/LiesksI.png) Eren “You’re a slave to a piece of shit”, Armin is referring that shit to Time-skip Eren’s supposed freedom, but the author could suggest “this piece of shit” being the Attack Titan.

&amp;#x200B;

Kenny [words](https://i.imgur.com/Bkqv9zo.png) in chapter 69.

“They couldn’t keep going unless they were drunk something….they were all slaves to something”

The Attack Titan is **a slave to its’ Absolute Freedom**.

Eren is a *slave* to his **freedom**, a *slave* to his **rage** and a **slave to the Attack Titan**.

&amp;#x200B;

Bringing up an ~~unpopular~~ theory I posted recently ([The Advancing Giant and his slave](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/az1uil/manga_spoilers_the_advancing_giant_and_his_slave/)):

&amp;#x200B;

“Isayama wanted to have the English title to be 'Attack on Titan' and not simply the 'Attack Titan', why is that so? How come he hasn't titled it as 'Attack on Titans'. Clearly he is referring to a **singular Titan** and not the 'titans'. What *attack* on which *titan* is he referring about?

The story's endgame villain could be the **devil** himself....the Attack Titan. The Attack Titan could be the one pulling the strings. This follows up the notion that Eren fights against his mental oppressor, and in the end, 'it' could be defeated.”

&amp;#x200B;

Axe Gears for the Dummies,"I'd like to blatantly state that I am not an axe user. All this information is thru my own research and knight experience. Axe users, feel free to criticize and correct any mistakes you see. 

!!WARNING!!

Levels 8-199 an average knight will be carrying Rift Lance/Executioner as their two handers, and sadly a Royal Axe as their one hander. 

I only posted weapons that are 60+. Why? Because from level 8-59 your weapon is basically changing every few levels. You're not gonna be fulling imbuing an Twin Axe (if you even have one) at level 50 just to change weapons in 10 levels.

ONE HANDERS

60-74 Heroic Axe [2]: standard weapon. Easy to obtain. No use in switching to hive scythe at level 70, since rift lance becomes available by that time. 

75-199 Royal Axe [2]: yep... An average knights best one hander until level 200. SCA? 1 slot. Hellforged axe? 1 slot. Crystalline axe? 1 slot. Sorry guys. 

80-199 Mythril Axe [2]: the magic sword of axes. Very rare, you probably do not have one so... Next.

85-199 Impaler [2]: again, you're lucky if you have one. 

200+ Axe of Destruction [3]: your go to one hander. Best one hand axe you can ask for. 

250+ Umbral Master Axe [1]: Skippable. 1 slot. Useless. 

TWO HANDERS

70-199 Rift Lance [3]: it will be the ONLY axe you can use until level 200 that has 3 slots. Take it or leave it. 

85-199 Executioner [2] very obtainable, but rare in some worlds. At this point, you are choosing between 1 extra slot (rift lance) or 3 extra attack (approx 21 damage). 

95-199 Great axe [2] if you have your hands on one of these. Again, you can use it over Rift Lance if you are planning on running Crit and Mana. 

120-249 Demonwing axe [2] preferably you want to transition into Chopper of Destruction. But if you are only running T3 vamp and void. You can stick with Demonwing Axe at your own risk until Umbral Master Chopper. In addition, this is a rare drop. Most likely you'll be skipping this weapon. 

200+ Chopper of Destruction [3]: like all destruction weapons (besides the bow and crossbow), they are OP. Invest in one as soon as possible. 

250+ Umbral Master Chopper [2]: great for team hunting or when you do not need the T3 vampirism anymore. Strongest physical axe in game. 

300+ Falcon Battleaxe [2]: this axe has an energy attack of 45. Endgame gear for high level axe users that live in Plague Seal. Mows down Banuta and Asura mirrors during solo hunts. You can hunt anywhere a gnomesword user can, but better. Also only axe recommended for Carnivores. 

AXE MODIFIERS

8+ Berserk Potion: I would only recommend it's usage for lower leveled knights who aren't able to or confident in using Blood Rage. Boosts melee skills by 5 but reduces shielding by 10 for ten minutes. Keep in mind if you get debuffed/buffed it will remove the potions effect. Not stackable. 

8+ Axe Ring: one of the only gears that has stayed true and constant since its introduction. +4 axe fighting and relatively cheap to buy them. 

100-199 Earthborn Titan Armor: super rare. Enough said. 

150+ Collar of Red Plasma: only amulet that provides +4 melee skill boosts. Also people look past the 5% physical protection it adds. 

150+ Ring of Red Plasma: I still think axe ring is better. ""BuT iT gIvEs 3 pHySical-"" YES I KNOW, +3 melee skill boost and 3% physical... Only use if prismatic rings are not available. 

180+ Ectoplasmic Shield: +3 to axe and club with 7% ice protection and a 3% fire weakness.  Compliments axe of Destruction if you want that little extra push of damage. At higher levels you may want to prioritize defense over offense. Chopper of Destruction will still overall deal more damage than Axe of Destruction with an Ectoplasmic Shield. Optional if I may say so. 

200+ Elemental Hauberk: it's good to have one during times that you don't wanna tick your imbued armor. You're not gonna be doing dragon bestiary with a fully imbued Falcon Plate. Optional to have one. Alternatively you can carry around an extra unimbued prismatic armor.

Now that the endgame is coming. I hope they go back to the old way of announcing movies.,"My wife and I are in the process of hyping up endgame. We started back at the beginning with Iron Man and are going to watch all of them in order. As we watch the first phase I’m noticing how they teased future movies and how excited I was at the end of Iron Man 2 to see Mjolnir and figure out Thor was next.  

I hope that after endgame they consider doing something similar to this. Don’t share announcements and news. Keep it all secret until another movie teases it.  I personally feel that Marvel doesn’t need to market its movies at all. We are all going to go see them. I know social media has evolved and that this might be impossible but I personally found it so much more exciting to figure out in an after credit scene what was next.

Endgame Problems,"Can we talk about endgame a little bit? Because I feel like problems are starting to pile up and I'm losing interest in a game *when the loot grind should just be starting*.

The game feels fantastic until endgame. Even early endgame is great when the new activities are fresh and you have new enemy types. Except then I started seeing how the loot system is *currently* structured, and I can't help but feel disappointed.

For some context, I have no interest in PvP, only PvE.

* Crafting weapons/gear has no purpose at endgame, since you can't craft at max gear score.
* There are 3 stores which reset their ~4 items weekly, but the items aren't at max gear score. So I'm not sure why you'd ever buy items in the endgame.
* If you aren't crafting and aren't buying items, there's not much to do with money. Just recalibration, but that's used infrequently.
* The recalibration station is a downgrade from the first game. You can no longer see what stats an item could have rolled, you can't use crafted items with it, you can only replace traits with similar traits (e.g. no offensive stat to defensive stat), and the transferred stat is capped in an unclear way. I didn't expect this to be nearly as restrictive as it currently is.
* There's no optimization station, so there's no way to level up the rolls/armor/damage of an item if you got it to roll perfectly otherwise. But since there's effectively no crafting, there's no way to specifically target upgrades or specifically target getting a god roll. I've already stopped getting daily upgrades for my main build and my gear is nowhere near perfect.
* Tidal basin and world tier 5 is looming, which bumps the gear score from 450 to 500. This means all loot grinding will be obsolete at some point (relatively soon, hopefully).
* Outside of a few exotic weapons, the only gear currently available are high-ends (yellows). There have ""brands"" which have ""sets"" of 1 to 3 items, but they're effectively just stat sticks. No green sets are currently in the game (supposedly to be released with WT5). This is a huge killer for me; it's like if Diablo 3 had zero set items and &lt;5 legendaries.
* Control points can be upgraded for increased rewards (from level 1 to level 4), but level 4 is massively overtuned. Level 4 also doesn't have worthwhile rewards, so you're pretty much always better off farming level 3s instead. The level 4s almost feel like an accidental inclusion.
* The skill mod system has a lot of issues, including high skill power requirements, mods not working as intended, skill power not scaling abilities, etc. The current best skill mods for non-skill builds are mods you got in the leveling process (i.e. level 10 skill mods). Why should that ever be the case?
* Shotguns and submachine guns feel undertuned. Part of the problem is the high enemy damage and high health on harder content, meaning it's dangerous to play so aggressively/close-range.

I'm hopeful that WT5 will fix a lot of these issues, and I hope it's slated for release soon, but *this* is the current endgame. When there are [posts](http://redd.it/b2r4v1) on the front page talking about grinding non-loot objectives, isn't that indicative of a problem?",thedivision,28,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b30j4t/endgame_problems/,,FuzzyDwarf,b30j4t,/r/thedivision/comments/b30j4t/endgame_problems/,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b30j4t/endgame_problems/,111,2019-03-19

Avengers Endgame Theory (Potential Spoilers),"Okay so last week we got the new Avengers Endgame trailer with a lot of new footage to breakdown. 

I want to focus on a particular scene, when Scott comes out of the quantum realm and is looking at missing signs. Not only can you see he has the suitcase handle of the building from Ant-Man and the Wasp in his right hand but the address on the house behind him is interesting.

The address reads 1064, and using Marvel Unlimited if you go to Avengers #10 it came out in 1964, the description reads.. ""Avengers Earth's Mightest Heroes battle Titans Across Time"". I know this may not mean much, but with the use of the word Titan and with the many theories of Time travel and the dates of the comic's publication it all adds up and doesnt feel like a coincidence.

Skill Power - Is this working as intended?,"Cool, so a patch landed today and skills can now be cast reliably!  So I whipped out the skill power items I've been hoarding to try them out.

Stats for reference.  **7.3K skill power (SP).  32% CDR.  450 gear score.  WT4**.  FYI, I had friends funnel me skill power gear to hit these amounts -- they are near perfect.  This would be pretty hard to manage solo.  I'm also getting +35% skill power from talents and gear sets.

I immediately discovered that skill power does not have ANY effect on skill healing or damage in any quantity -- based on the tooltip and confirmed in combat.  I can actually stack up to 8k+ SP and see no effect.  **Is this intended?  A bug?**

I mean I could see an argument that SP basically just allows unlocks of the mods, which allow you to slot for more damage, CDR, etc. (assuming you have those mods).  But if that's the case, then skill power is just completely useless otherwise and is only necessary to hit mod requirements?  That seems inconsistent with both TD1 and every other stat in the game.

It also means that even rocking pretty awesome gear, my skills do very little damage without mods.  I also discovered that over my entire play time, I have discovered only **3 mods** that actually increase damage.  None on drone.  One on seeker.  None on firefly.  One on turret. None on hive. One on chem launcher.

If this is the system, a viable skill build would be insanely RNG dependent at endgame.  I need perfect gear to even wear the on-level mods, am forced to stack a stat that does literally nothing, and then I need the right mods to drop to actually deal enough damage to kill anything?  I can craft, but the mods aren't on level and the blueprints are sold randomly by vendors.  Oh, and skills still have pretty long cooldowns even stacking up to 60%+ CDR.  So I'm only killing a single normal target every 30-60 seconds.

Like I'm hoping someone will tell me this is a bug.

**EDIT 1:** Oh, the seeker mine mod that adds mines has no discernible effect on all mine types.  It doesn't increase targets on cluster and has no effect at all on the others.  This seems bugged.",thedivision,23,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b2q51s/skill_power_is_this_working_as_intended/,Question,da3strikes,b2q51s,/r/thedivision/comments/b2q51s/skill_power_is_this_working_as_intended/,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b2q51s/skill_power_is_this_working_as_intended/,27,2019-03-19

Phase 4 Theory based off a Captain Marvel SPOILER...,"Obviously any number of things can happen, especially because we haven't seen Endgame yet but here is a theory I have for Phase 4.

So in Captain Marvel we are introduced to Project Pegasus, the secret program first seen in Avengers 1 that is a joint effort with Nasa to study the Tesseract to, as Fury claims ""Harness energy from space."" Well in Captain Marvel we saw it was originally Mar-Vell developing a lightspeed engine which was ultimately destroyed and given the present MCU it is clear that humanity has never been able to develop another. Considering CM takes place in the 90's, a few shy of 30 years ago, Shield and Nasa wouldn't just stop the lightspeed engine project after the first was destroyed and the switch to ""energy research"". Also as we have seen, the MCU has given many heroes powers stemming from Infinity Stones, here is my theory......THE FANTASTIC FOUR WERE INVOLVED IN PROJECT PEGASUS POST CAPTAIN MARVEL.

Let's break this down a bit...

Fantastic Four backstory:
While the F4 were the first superhero team comic, their original backstory is so vague that it could easily be translated to the MCU through Project Pegasus. (Comic: They were test flying a craft and were exposed to cosmic rays) (MCU Alternative: They were test flying an attempted rebuild of the lightspeed engine and a malfunction exposed them to cosmic rays/tesseract energy/insert whatever anomaly you choose here)

Fitting them into the MCU:
So the F4 worked on Project Pegasus in the late 90s and something goes wrong with the new lightspeed engine. The engine blasts them with energy, giving them their signature powers but then what? Are 4 humans just magically adrift in space for 20 plus years and somehow survive? NO. What if the new engine, running off tesseract energy pulls a Red Skull and warps them away......TO THE NEGATIVE ZONE! 

Now you may be asking why nobody would say anything about them for so long, well they already explained that in CM, Project Pegasus is a secret. Anyone who knew the participants weren't told what happened. It's like the people just vanished. Perfect cover for that. 

Leading into Phase 4:
So to wrap this up, again we don't know what is going to happen in Endgame or who is going to survive into Phase 4 but putting the F4 in the Negative Zone provides many options. For starters, how they get out of the Negative Zone. Does Antman find some way through the Quantum Realm? Could Dr. Strange get there as one of the alternate universes? Or my favorite, could it take a page from Annihilation and they come through the point where the positive and negative zones collide, The Kyln! It'd be fun to go back there after Guardians 1 as yet another tie in.  

And finally with Phase 4 and beyond. Kevin Feige said that the future of the MCU is more cosmic. Well if they don't kill Thanos, or even if they did Marvel could do an adaptation of Annihilation. The looming villain to replace Thanos could be Annihilus! The F4 come out of the Negative Zone and almost act as messengers of the doom (pun intended) that is to come! 


Anyway, that's my theory/suggestion....if you read the whole thing I appreciate it! I now await the comments to tear me down.

It's such a great time to be a comic book fan or a fan of superhero movies.,"We're in the golden age of comic films, we get around 3-4 new movies a year and they're always getting better, bigger actors, budgets and stories.

The cinematic universe being intertwined means we see all of our favorite heroes interact at some point or another.

We're a month away from endgame which will probably be the highest grossing and epic superhero movie of all time that will leave us all crying.

And to conclude, tomorrow the Fox/Disney merger goes through and we introduce characters such as X-Men, Deadpool and Fantastic Four into the MCU.

Why is there no progression in the current kibble system?,"There is no progression in the current kibble system whatsoever. Why even bothering to tame early stuff like dodos, dilos and parasaurs? You wont need it anyways. The way it is now you should prioritize mutton taming an argent and start getting low level ankys for eggs.
 
Let me explain:
 
Early game:
 
I tame dodos and dilos. For what? To get extra small eggs and tame other dodos and dilos? A parasaur for small sized eggs? I could rather berry tame 10 low level parasaurs than go through the trouble for extra small eggs.
 
I then tame raptors and trikes with my parasaur eggs. For what? I need a good berry gatherer at this point and even might want a Pteranodon soon.
 
Now I need to tame Stegos, Ankys, Iguanodons, Carbonemys or others for medium sized eggs, which I dont have the eggs for of course. Why? Because they frickin need their own (medium sized) eggs.
 
Finally having a nice farm of Ankys (or others) I can start taming large egg layers. Which of course I dont have the kibble for. Why? Because they need large sized eggs, which again they themselves provide.
 
Btw. This, finally, is the point in game where you can finally get a Pteranodon...
 
Getting to end game:
 
Extra large eggs are needed to tame Rexes, Yutis, Theris, Quetz and others. Wouldn't it be great to have their kibble after all that taming and gathering eggs? Well, you cant have it. Why? Because they need f**kin EXTRA LARGE EGGS TO TAME!!
 
I wont even go into special eggs. Whoever thought of that bs should be beheaded.
 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
This is how it should be:
 
- use dodo and dilo eggs for trikes and raptors
 
- use trike and raptor eggs for ankys, doeds, carnos and pteras
 
- use anky, carno and ptera eggs for argents, allos, tapes
 
- use argent, allo and tape eggs for rexes, quetz, yutis
 
- use rex, quetz and yuti eggs for gigas, rock elementals, some other stuff
 
- use wyvern, rock drake and hesperornis eggs to make kibble that gives a 1.5x boost to all taming when used.
 
Seriously, wtf are Thylas and Megalanias doing in the special egg category? They are nice tames but end of endgame tames? No way.
 
I might sound angry, haha. But I'm really not. Just wanted to get my opinion out there.
 
Tl;dr: the current kibble system has no progression whatsoever. It should be changed to a logically step by step system, adjusting tames like the carno to be available earlier.",playark,14,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/playark/comments/b2x16p/why_is_there_no_progression_in_the_current_kibble/,,Guardianangel93,b2x16p,/r/playark/comments/b2x16p/why_is_there_no_progression_in_the_current_kibble/,https://www.reddit.com/r/playark/comments/b2x16p/why_is_there_no_progression_in_the_current_kibble/,46,2019-03-19

I read many theories and people always discuss about how Thanos will be killed or who will put the final blow on Thanos, etc. But he's an interesting and unique character.

Some stupid questions from beginner,"Hello guys! I started to play eso about a week ago and really love this game. After some wow experience I was looking for  a good mmo rpg on ps4 and I think I found the one.

I always love stealth in video games so I choose wood elf nighblade as a first character. Besides that I learned that nb also can be a tank or a healler and I always love this two roles in PVE while playing PVP overall.

So my questions are:

1. Is heavy armor necessary for tank nb? Can I use the same armor for dd, tank and healler specs during the levelling and in endgame? 
2. Is gear for PvP and PvE are the same or do I need to farm them separately?
3. How do I tank as nb? In WoW tanks has (mb ""had"", have not been playing for a long time) agro mechanic there your abilities make not much damage but generate a lot of agro because of passives. Is this game the same?
4. What specs, abilities, rotation should I use in the beginning to understand nb as a class? There is a lot of guides in the net but all of them are about endgame strategies.
5. Some tips overall will be appreciated.

Thank you very mach in advance and sorry for my english :)

"Episode 1: Ninja Art, Potato Style: ANTI LOOT SUMMONING NO JUTSU! (The Truth About Anthem's Loot and Why We Should Trust Bioware)","# INTRODUCTION: *Let's keep this simple and to the point*

Anthem is an amazing game that is currently being held back by a lot of baffling, questionable and disappointing choices. In the world of game development, I would label this game an omnishambles - a shambles so mystically baffling, that even non-game developers can spot the myriad of problems established in the grand 6-year development of this game.

&amp;nbsp;

This post and others following it will be written in the current style of Bioware. Just like Anthem, there will be style, there will be substance, but you may also be left baffled, confused and wondering if you got anything from your time spent.
&gt;The simplest solution is almost always the best.

&gt;-Occlam's Razor

Bioware didn't follow this saying, let's discuss!

# Episode 1: Ninja Art, Potato Style: ANTI LOOT SUMMONING NO JUTSU!

&amp;nbsp;


# The WHAT: 'Rewarding the player' with loot
So this is obvious right? Level 1-30 we go through the typical rarity ranges and loot that we know we will eventually be pointless - commons, uncommons, rares. Post 30 these are all useless except maybe for a sigil and to practice dismantling. Rares are actually there to add a bit of variety to the colours we get when the all too common 'purple rain' drops from a chest.

&amp;nbsp;

Epics are important to deck out in to enter GM1 and for grinding for '+Harvest bonus' (so you can craft your loot in a looter shooter) or a build that doesn't care about scaling on your melee, ultimate, or weapon procs (e.g. Thunderbolt of Yvenia). Sorry, I mean for builds that don't care about the most fun mechanics in the game. Oh and also for sigils. These are super important as well by the way, as everybody loves purple rain and we can throw 5 of them at the screen even on GM3 sometimes for even more fun dismantling practice! 

&gt; *Loot Feature #1: Even though all the lower rarities will be eventually dismantled, dismantling was intended as a fun mechanic - that's why we can't scrap quickly at the end of an expedition!*

&amp;nbsp;

Masterworks and Legendaries. Oh yeah, let's not forget about them (they're so scarce sometimes I do). This rarity of items is the one we are actually looking for. Ever be super excited for something (like Anthem) but then when you finally get it, it's not as great as you hoped and you feel a bit sad? Welcome to Anthem's loot in a nutshell (more likely to find a legendary drop in a nutshell than in a chest to be fair).

&gt; *Loot Feature #2: An anti-climax is the best way to reward players, get them excited with a rare drop, and then ruin their dreams with useless inscriptions! In 3 months when things are fixed they will look back at the old days and never complain again!*

&amp;nbsp;

So loot overall can be compared to watching an episode of your favourite TV show. Imagine watching it but instead of following the main character, we segway into a [insert length of your GM1/2/3 run here] documentary on where a local pigeon has flown through the day. That's what it feel's like when you get that coveted purple rain. When you do manage to get a bit of orange added to the palette the rest of the game is  [insert length of your GM1/2/3 run here] long advert just after a cliffhanger moment, only to find that nothing interesting actually happened [insert bad rolls on your item here]. 1 dismantle later and you're questioning your existence. Did I just spend 30 minutes in a GM2 to dismantle 30 items? The answer is yes, because dismantling is fun!

&gt; *Loot Feature #3: Even before having a full set of legendaries, let's allow the player to frequently encounter useless loot even to the point of completing hour long GM3's and dismantling everything.*

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


# The WHY: 'Trust me....' - Bioware

Let's not get ahead of ourselves though, we are not game developers! There is a greater plan here than we can possibly comprehend. Rome was not built in a day and Anthem was not built in 6 years!
&gt; Sidenote: *Someone just told me that games created in 6 years can have a lot more content, balancing and less bugs than Anthem does? I think they mentioned Destiny 1/2, Division 2, Diablo 1/2/3, Borderlands 1/2, Warframe, Pokemon and Microsoft Pinball 1998? Anyways, don't listen to this nonsense! Anthem is the first of it's kind and they had nothing to base their game off so give them a break!*

So the simple question is, why is there no loot? They buffed the loot, but why has the full *LOOT SUMMONING NO JUTSU* not been activated? Well here is what I imagine goes on in Bioware's head.

&amp;nbsp;

**Well, we really don't want players to get max level in a week, that's not really fun is it?**

Trust BioWare here because 99% of the player base of their game spend 10-15hours a day playing and can reasonably expect that to be the case. Also, these kinds of player are known for stopping once they have all legendaries and not going for a min-maxed build! Also, you're absolutely right, I don't want to loot good items and make fun builds in a game I paid for - I trust them!

&amp;nbsp;

**Dismantling should not be faster because of reasons**

Yes exactly, like mentioned before, spending 1 hour in a GM3 only to dismantle all of your loot is a fun game mechanic, and as you contemplate your wasted hour due to poor rolls, you need this time slowly dismantling everything to calm down. Where's the lamb sauce? In this case, there is none.

&amp;nbsp;

**We could make loot more varied by having a variation in power levels on items, for example, GM1 could be 40-60 power level items, GM2 could be 60-75 and GM3 could be 75-100. This way we could also increase the drop rate of loot to be higher so player's are constantly getting small upgrades but despite this they can't get max level too quick and also even when they have all max power level gear they would still be searching for the best rolls and finally, also, in conclusion, with all the extra masterworks sir, they could have fun crafting placeholders, or experimenting with builds, till they get their god rolls. I say this all because we as game developers have sat down in a room and discussed this out properly over the last 6 years and we know what we are doing!**

Come on, guys! Trust Bioware, with their probably 200+ sized development team there's no way they can find the time to do this! Anyways, it was probably an intern who suggested such a silly idea and the upper management would never greenlight such a silly, silly, idea that wasn't mentioned by the shareholders who probably don't even play the game. I mean the guy who typed that out probably came up with that silly idea in about 5 seconds. It's like what that Diablo 3 developer said about Loot 2.0, that made absolutely 0 sense! Come on guys, who would want to make the game more fun for the players?!


&amp;nbsp;


**We have 6 years lads and ladies, let's make some good decisions like bosses not having a chance to drop legendaries. HEAR HEAR!**

I feel like this one is self-explanatory? Bosses are just normal enemies, not chests! Holding a button to open a chest is a lot more difficult and that's why you can only get legendaries from chests. Also, implementing something like this would take 50 new interns and they just can't handle that at this time. Give it 3 months.

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;



# The HOW: ""Ooh child, things are gonna get easier""

So let's wrap up by suggesting how we can fix this, this is the easy part so I'll keep it short and sweet, just like Anthem's endgame!


**Patience is a virtue: Wait 3 months**

Look, let's be completely honest here, no messing around. 6 years is just not enough time to discuss loot, and if you noticed Anthem didn't really have a huge public alpha or beta, only a demo of the full, polished game. It's not their fault that they couldn't test things themselves - they probably didn't have any time to play their own game. So they need 3 months to make a few changes okay? Maybe it's just a line of code (MasterworkChanceRate = 0.00000000000001) they can change (MasterworkChanceRate = 0.00001 + VoodooMagic) or maybe it's thousands of lines and their myriad of developers need months to collectively fix it by having weekly discussions on whether more loot and making players happy is a good idea. But either way, we have to wait - during this time don't blame them for the poor drop rates that once upon a time were actually really good and made everyone happy and was even mentioned in articles (which was free positive exposure for Anthem) - no no no, just wait, and hope.


# And that's how the cookie crumbles (the cookie being Anthem's player base)

So yeah, Anthem is actually a very smart game and all the loot choices are 10/10. If I see one more post about loot I'll have to move on to Episode 2!

A Spicy Hot Prediction of Avengers: Endgame,"Picture it now....

You got your popcorn and sodie-pop. Your middle aisle, middle row seat. IMAX theater. You’ve been waiting for Avengers: Endgame for 10 years now. 

Fast forward.

Movie is over. The audience is hit by the loss of Captain America. Credits are rolling, you’re waiting for the end credit scene. 

The screen lights up, an alley in New York City. Two muggers holding up a figure hidden from the screen. “Give me all your money hot shot!” Camera pans over. It’s Chris Evans. The crowd is confused. Is this a flash back? There’s no way he’s alive?

Chris Evans smirks, and then says two words “Flame On”

"The game is good, but can we start talking about the issues now?","I just want to start by saying this game is a great improvement over the original. I am quite happy with it and more than happy that my pre-order was worth it. With that said though, the game is far from perfect, there are quite a few issues at endgame that definitely warrant some discussion and perhaps change? I was fortunate that this game came out during my spring break week so OF COURSE I rotted my dick off. I figured I would just list things that are of concern as I would like to discuss and hear others feedback so, to start...
&amp;nbsp;

#Re-calibration

- The way this works seems like a fine idea when you're leveling but there are some things I have thought MAY be a real concern later on. We can't change stats to something different, that is to say if you have an electronics roll and want to swap it to say an armor or damage roll you can't. That electronics can only ever be electronics. It's raining HE loot so it's not a huge deal but when we start getting exotic/set armor I could see this being very frustrating. Getting a piece of gear and not being able to use it because it messes with your balancing act for perks etc.

- Storage of perks is already becoming a huge issue for me and id imagine others. Im currently sitting on around 45/100 inventory slots used because there are items with perks im saving for later consumption. Im not sure how it could be done but being able to store perks at the bench would be a great idea. Consume the item and store the perk I just ripped off of it for later application to an item.

- You can't re-calibrate down only across. This one seems a little silly to me but, I can't take what im calling an ""elite"" perk and swap to a ""basic"" perk. So perks with the empty circle can only be swapped to perks with the empty circle. And the circle + chevron perks can only be swapped between those. Letting us swap an elite perk down to a basic perk would be nice. There ARE some instances where I would prefer 8% crit chance over 10% chance to make enemies bleed when shot in the legs.

---

# Enemies, AI &amp; The Open World

- So the enemy AI is definitely an improvement over the first game but when you get to wt4 and do alert4 cps some real problems start to show. And it's the same complaints that people made with the first game, the enemies get VERY spongy and VERY aggressive. When it's one or the other like throughout the story or on hard/challenging it's engaging and fun. A low health enemy that pushes you fast can be dealt with as long as you pay attention. There are too many instances however of throwers charging me out of the gate. Having a fine balance is super important here to me. I would much rather have longer waves of enemies with lower health and high aggression or more passive enemies with larger health pools but not both at the same time. The first game really struggled with this.

- Glue man chus! Seriously though, the glue sprayer enemies are a neat idea. Getting sprayed with some kind of insulation foam is neat but the animation to break free needs some work. It takes about a second to break free and another second for the animation to finish. I don't think this needs discussion, you shouldn't be animation locked when you followed the prompt.

- Roaming enemies are great and make for a really engaging world, can we please have a leash? I have had enemies follow me into different zones and to safe houses. Most rpgs have a mechanic like this, eventually the enemy leaves and resets.

- Calling for help! When you're doing your control points and you send out your flare, the cavalry you just called for really needs some kind of immunity. Very often you call them and they end up 250+m away because they ran into and are now engaging a convoy. While this is neat for sure it can often times cause the cp to bug out or force you to repeat waves. This is especially rough when you're clearing an alert4

---

#Your Agent, Skills &amp; Stats

- So lets talk about health.... Why? This was something I have been wondering about since level 10. Health seems largely irrelevant. If you lose all your armor in any circumstance you're pretty much dead or at least cat-calling death from his front yard. Health,health on kill and health regen seem like completely useless stats. It's fine to have ""weak"" stats in an rpg but the more I looked at other stats I realized something. Every other stat in game is very strong on it's own or combined. Every damage/electronics stat sees some use so if we're following that trend I feel like health should become useful. Im not sure what to change here, all I know is that health is largely useless. It's the only stat you don't really ever notice benefits from. In my head I was playing with the idea of baseline ""recovery"" wherein when you kill an enemy you have a small amount of armor that is granted. So a very small amount of armor on kill that would be baseline. And then say instead of +8900 health you'd see +18% recovery. So if the baseline armor on kill was 2% or some other number if you had enough you could see some benefit from it? Maybe. Im no idea guy all I know is that health is the only roll on gear that is ""feelsbad"".


- Stat numbers, can I please see what is going to change on my character? I have 2 pieces of armor with double armor rolls. They're both 450. One of them drops me to 7 armor while the other brings me to 9. Guh????? Let me see what my Armor/Damage/Electronics will change to if I equip an item. Please.

- Weapons need some real re-balancing. I know this will happen but definitely sooner rather than later. The guns that are strong so far that I have personally used don't feel OP but the guns that are weak feel damn near useless. Shotguns yet again are pretty much instant decons. I have had many perfectly rolled shottys. Semi and pump and they are terrible past 5m. I get that pvp would be awful if shottys were good but don't punish pve players. This goes for smgs as well. They have generally poor range and poor accuracy. 10-15m and if you DO hit an enemy you'll do maybe 1% of their health in damage because of fall off. Rifles... what the hell happened here? Many of them do AR damage with rpms of 300 or so and questionable accuracy. These feel awful to use in most cases. The base 20-30 chd isn't enough to make up for how low the damage is. Health damage on the assault rifles is pretty much a dead stat as well. I get that they don't want ARs just running the game again but maybe just give like 1-10% armor damage? Hell even 1-6% rolls. Anything is better than health damage. When an enemies armor is gone they're already dead. So this state is like telling me I can make the enemy 29% more dead.

- Buff refreshing. Buff refreshing. Buff refreshing. Seriously. Let me refresh a buff. The first game had this problem as well, some buffs from talents etc. have ""kills refresh this duration"" in the description so you can refresh the buff while you have the buff. Meanwhile there are other perks that require you to let the buff expire before refreshing. The unstoppable armor perk is a great example. Killing an enemy grants 2% weapon damage per 10k armor. Awesome. I have 190k armor so that's a fat ass buff. When the buff is about to expire and I kill an enemy. It doesn't refresh. Why? I can't see any reason for this to be the case with other similar on kill effects. You just end up with gaps in the buff and it forces a clunky play style if you're trying to use it effectively.

- Specialist weapons. Can I please pull out? Never thought id say that. Let me pull my spec weapon out and let me use grenades while it's out. Simple. I hardly ever use it because it can be a death sentence especially if you know there are rushers about.

Well if you made it this far thanks for the read! I just want to say one more time I love this game. I have fun playing it period. But these things add up and sometimes they lead to those ""Really????"" moments. Which stinks because other aspects of the game are a homerun. I just want some discussion about balance/systems at endgame so it can improve asap. Anywho, happy shoots and loots to ye all.

50 titan kills and loot.,"I decided to make my own loot research after ""loot buff"". After killing one titan you get 2 pieces of loot so 50 small titan kills in GM3 legendary contracts resulted in: 

* Blues - 15
* Purples - 67
* MWs - 17
* LEGs - 1

I am a 774 Storm. So a top-tiered level player is playing top-tiered endgame activity using top-tiered difficulty modifier and killing top-tiered enemies but gains a SINGLE piece of top-tiered loot. I had NO LEGs till 48 titans kills. This is not acceptable. This should not be this way. I feel my time and efforts are not worth it.   


Do you think that was an awesome legendary? I feel you know the answer already. A piece of useless garbage it was.  


Tonns of time nerves and efforts in exchange for what? No progression. No desire to run the game. It feels disgusting when you like the core gameplay but hate the reward system and you have to struggle with yourself to play the game or not every time.

Weekly Clan Projects are impossible for small clans.,"I know there has to be a balance, but me and my friends have a clan of 7 and it's literally impossible to complete the projects. Especially when one of them is related to the black tusk faction (none of us have been able to hit endgame yet). There should be a smaller requirement for smaller clans. An idea for a system could be something like a cooldown for leaving a clan that way people can't exploit it. Also make to where if a clan is at say 50 they keep the challenges for the week even if people leave.

"Armor damage should be on rifles, not Crit Damage. (Long post)","TL;DR: Rifles are supposed to be high powered weapons with high damage, high accuracy, variable stability, as a result lower mag size or rate of fire. They currently roll with crit damage, which is reduced to at most 60% of its true value since that is the Crit chance Cap. This is not multiplicative damage like out of cover damage with LMG's that stacks on top of your crits, and due to their low fire rate are generally an inferior choice to nearly any other weapon depending on distance. Changing their class bonus to provide armor damage would solve this.

With the exception of certain rifles absolutely melting people in PVP (probably due to unbalanced numbers in normalization), Rifles overall feel incredibly weak in pve endgame. For long engagement distances a properly build sniper can 1 shot nearly any enemy besides the tankiest purples. A rifle cannot, and requires you to continue shooting and risk getting killed yourself. At close range an smg boosts your CRIT CHANCE which is a far more important stat, and generally has a much higher Burst DPS and sometimes Sustained DPS.

If you're any bit of a theorycrafter, you know that the Strained + Berserk talent combo is quite strong, but only if you have been recently damaged, have your armor destroyed, or in pvp walk sideways and shoot stuff engagements. The problem is you require pretty much exactly 5 Damage (red) attributes. Well this simply does not work well in endgame PVE. I currently have 13 RED, 60% crit chance, about 20% all weapon damage, and I've tried alternating between anywhere from 60-130% HSD, and 50-90% CHD.

I also tested a 16 Red Sharpshooter Sniper + LMG build focused on weapon and headshot damage, and a Demolitionist build with Chatterbox and the same LMG with ~43% crit chance to reach 60% cap, almost no crit damage, and a decent bit of Weapon damage (The LMG specifically absolute melts at long, and short ranges. It is an M60 with unhinged, sitting at over 25k damage).
I then altered my builds slightly to test rifles and they are incredibly weak against anything with armor, even with headshots, because their talent does almost nothing, and is additive to the CHD you already have.

First let me tell you a basic math theory behind crit. With a max crit chance of 60%, rolling most of your RED attributes to CHD (and therefore lacking greatly in any WEAPON damage, or HSD damage) as well as CHC to actually reach 60% means your weapon will do alright damage on a crit, but absolutely nothing normally. 

A popular talent right now is Sadist + Berserk, and while that actually works in PVP, it is awful in PVE and people don't realize it. To unlock it you need 5 or less RED attributes, and you also need to take damage. You don't want to take damage. This means almost no headshot damage, no weapon damage, no crit damage, just some crit chance rolls to attempt to reach 60%. Weapon mods can help you offset that, but not enough. Try it in any alert 4 control point, or a heroic bounty and unless you have a dedicated group of 4 with at least one person taking aggro or using crowd control, or you get super lucky solo and avoid anyone throwing grenades at you, its not viable. Step out of cover once with low health and you're dead. Heal yourself and you loose your damage.

Here is a list of far better talents:
* Ranger - more damage at long ranges, good for sniping with rifles.
* Killer - Reach 100% crit chance if you get a kill with a crit, and continue the chain.
* Rifleman - Good for Headshot focused builds.
* My personal Favorite: Boomerang - 20% more damage every other shot, and double magazine size. Try it on an 1886.

All of those talents, and others, are far better than Sadist, at least in PVE. This then leads me back to the Rifle category bonus. Currently there is almost nothing in the game that gives you armor damage, aside from gear mods. The rifle category is the perfect solution. Single, powerful shots designed to shred enemy armor. Make your shots count, and see the armor bars drop. Replace the awful 60% of 15% = 9% more additive damage with 5-15% enemy armor damage depending on how you want to balance it.

Most weapons serve a purpose. Assault rifle's new purpose is good sustained damage, and absolutely obliterating anything without armor. A riffle's purpose should be shredding enemy armor.

Long post sorry not sorry. I like rifles, but they're just don't have a good bonus.",thedivision,326,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3c1l4/armor_damage_should_be_on_rifles_not_crit_damage/,,hersheydood,b3c1l4,/r/thedivision/comments/b3c1l4/armor_damage_should_be_on_rifles_not_crit_damage/,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3c1l4/armor_damage_should_be_on_rifles_not_crit_damage/,162,2019-03-20

Why is Jagex so ultra-conservative on consumable balancing recently? It's unnecessary and unenjoyable for everyone,"In the order of most to least egregious:

**Elite Sirenic/Tectonic**

Elite sirenic/tectonic are literally worth using nowhere except EDGs.

**Black stone arrows**

Black stone arrows could have been as common as araxxyte arrows and not consumed past max stacks or even not consumed at all like normal arrows, and no one would have cared. We *would have had an easy option for camping t92 arrows with chargebow* and not have to remove the arrows after we're done debuffing. *Many people don't bother with the arrows because of this hassle even when ranging Vorago and Nex, where you'd think it would be ideal to use them (per phase at Vorago, takes time to ramp up, sacrifice bolt proc chance, cost adds up quickly)*, and continue using hammer at raids/AoD which is a one off ability with no combat tradeoff except adren; it's not like these arrows even make ED3 profitable.

**Erethdor's Grimoire**

Grimoire could have cost 500k-1m/hr to use and no one would care. Instead it's much close to 4-5m/hr. You can still net profit at endgame bosses while using it in the long-term, but so many people don't bother and just arma book instead because it doesn't give you more kills/hr to justify taking such a huge chunk out of your profit.

**Bakriminel bolts**

Onyx and Hydrix bolts are viable but still far more expensive than they need to be. [Here is a solution.](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/3dxr1a/onyxhydrix_bolts_are_still_not_worth_using/)

**honorable mention: limitless sigil**

Limitless sigil charges could also be made cheaper but it's not a huge deal compared to the other ones here.

**This is a pervasive issue and Jmods/balancers need to change their attitude about this for the overall health of PvM**

This is a consistent trend, and instead of balancing it by 10-15% (double grimoire page chance for example), I want Jagex to just be mindful and balance the egregious ones here by a few hundred % because it's absurd and getting out of hand. You should *want* to use best in slot for endgame bosses, not use the inferior options because of cost per hour. Remember that trimmed masterwork was initially degrade-to-dust in the design doc and only changed when players saw it and said ""hell no that's ridiculous.""

What is Jagex trying to do with this way overboard balancing? Are they worried about power creep? Because as far as I'm concerned, giving us the power creep but making it too expensive for us to actually want to use it is the dumbest solution, especially when it's not good enough to be an absolute necessity and there are alternatives that make more sense.",runescape,205,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/b3igdk/why_is_jagex_so_ultraconservative_on_consumable/,,ldvgvnbtvn,b3igdk,/r/runescape/comments/b3igdk/why_is_jagex_so_ultraconservative_on_consumable/,https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/b3igdk/why_is_jagex_so_ultraconservative_on_consumable/,147,2019-03-20

The REAL endgame is trying to figure out how this shit works.,"I had a realization today that the endgame for me has largely turned into the entertainment we get from simply trying to figure out how this enigma works underneath.  It seems every night we've been playing recently, we've been experimenting on different combinations of power levels, luck and activities just to try to understand how on earth this game makes it's often less than intuitive decisions.  I work as a (non gaming) developer so I suppose my mind just tends to automatically go into problem solving mode.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a number of mechanics in this game that are completely opaque to the user.  Things are not documented well, and where there is no documentation often the result is also something that doesn't automatically feel right.  Cracking the code has actually become an unintended fun aspect of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scaling**

In my opinion this is easily the most confusing, counterproductive and largest issue that affects the game.  Currently it just doesn't make sense and often behaves in ways that are the opposite of what users expect.  This seems to run the entire gamut of scaling from enemy damage and health scaling, javelin stats scaling across power level and inscription bonuses, scaling of content in the same instance with dis-similarly leveled squadmates, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Looting**

Ah, the most entertaining system of voodoo to try to unravel.  It won't be long until the number of loot theories outpaces man has never been on the moon theories, flat earth theories and bigfoot theories combined.  Is having this much luck or that much luck better?  Is it better to equip a legendary with no luck than a masterwork with luck?  Is having our friend that is still under 700 gear level harming our drop quality?   Does loot seem to get better or worse during certain times or phases, weekly, monthly or otherwise?  Why would you give me the same three legendary items I already had and don't even use within a few days? Why!

&amp;#x200B;

**Inscriptions**

So, how does this inscription work, what exactly is it doing?  Can I even tell a difference after I've equipped it?  Is there more of a point to this or that inscription than might logically make sense?

&amp;#x200B;

**Gear Specific Abilities**

There are a lot of MW/LEG specific gear bonuses that are only explained with a single line of text and some of them seem to have conditions that are quite specific before they do anything at all and in ways you need to experiment a lot with before you can reliably know how to use it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this post comes across as negative or not, having to question any of the above is not particularly positive for any game.  That being said, I find I am kind of actually enjoying myself in solving the unsolved mysteries, catching glimpses of other people's research and discoveries.   If they were to explain/fix everything tomorrow, I might even miss the endgame that I've found myself in.",AnthemTheGame,176,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b3cpka/the_real_endgame_is_trying_to_figure_out_how_this/,Discussion,BinaryJay,b3cpka,/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b3cpka/the_real_endgame_is_trying_to_figure_out_how_this/,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/b3cpka/the_real_endgame_is_trying_to_figure_out_how_this/,29,2019-03-20

[MCU] Iron Man saw the future,"This is about the visualization Tony had at the beginning of Age of Utron. Its no revelation that Tony Stark saw all his friends (at least Cap was then) dead atop a crusty looking rock. It was only a scene where Wanda made him realise his worst fears, and that might have been metaphorical for Civil War. But heres why theres more to it that needs thinking and im going to analyse a few finer aspects. 

 • No way it was metaphorically meant to imply Civil War. The Hulk dying due to multiple spears inside him. Thor was dead too and was never a part of Civil War. Steve Rogers expected Tony to 'come sooner' as he said with his dying breath. 

 • The scene in particular was set on an unearthly looking rocky surface, and above that is what we see through Tonys eyes - the Chitauri invasion in progress, but only from the other side of the massive portal through which they swoop down the realm of New York city. The giant portal itself looms above where Tony stands, and he sees Earth through it. 

 • At the end of the first Avengers , Tony flies into the same portal. We can be sure of that since we see from the vision he has in the later film (AOU) that, the Chitauri spaceships and creatures are right behind the portal. 

 • In Age of Ultron again, Tony describes what he saw over at the other side of the portal as 'That up there is the Endgame'. remember the word 'Endgame' as not some promotional dialogue for future film. He literally saw the 'Endgame' in his own words. And if by that word he means an alien race, that he manages to blast with the help of a nuke, then that word would be giantly understated. 

 • The very same 'Endgame' prompted him to create Ultron. And since he was so concerned about Endgame, it seeped deep into his thoughts and Scarlet witch merely projected it out for him. 

 • Now joining the dots, 'Endgame' is quite literally the vision Tony Stark had, and is in essence all the Avengers beaten by a powerful foe and therefore dead. 

 • So plainly speaking, what Stark saw at the time when he flew into the portal to rescue New York City from a nuclear projectile, was the same vision he later had in AOU. The difference being that in the vision he was in it rather that watching like a spectator from far. Both scenes take place beyond the portal. 

 • Another tidbit that is intetesting. In Infinity War, when Bruce Banner appraises Tony and Doctor Strange of the whole situation, his eyes glow with concern. Maybe im reading into it too much, but what i interpreted of Tonys expression is that of pure dread of what he once percieved as the 'Endgame' when he asks Bruce to 'say his name again' like it were something he expected.

"PSA: For anyone who levels new characters, consider level 36 wrath corrupted ring + string of servitude, aswell as Circle of guilt","I've messed around a bit with the buff effect of several items including the new circle of guilt and the not so new corrupted wrath rings and ive found that they both offer absurd damage for very little investment.

As an example, the ring and a perfectly rolled string of servitude with buff effect will give you 27 to 427 lightning damage to attacks (average of 227 lightning dmg). This is from only one ring slot and a belt slot. You can further utilize the tempest, which has a high attack speed, 100% increased lightning damage and some extra lightning damage.

For even more crazy damage, pick up moltenstrike and utilize its crazy damage effectiveness. A HoWA moltenstrike character, would need a total of 412 int, just to get this bonus, WHICH YOU CAN GET FROM LVL 36 WITH ANY WEAPON!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, it is also possible to utilize the damage buff from the Circle of Guilt, which gives up to 100%(!!!) increased buff effect from Herald of Purity PR RING SLOT. This will net you a total of 17,5 added physical damage at the point of you being able to equip the rings. This isnt very interesting, but once you gain some levels and start to hit endgame it will take a turn for the better. With a level 21 herald of purity, a helmet with +1 to socketed gems (implicit) aswell as +3 to socketed minion gems can together with an empower at lvl 4 (you can get by with lvl 3 just fine too), you can get up to 52 to 78 added phys pr ring slot to BOTH spells and attacks. This is exceptionally good paired with items such as facebreakers, doomfletch prism or a voidforge. You can get a total of 156-224 added phys damage from this. For comparison, abyssus (which has a minimum of 40% increased phys dmg taken) will give you 40-60 added phys. The best part it that it only reserves 31% (because of empower) of your mana so you can also use Hatred, this can even be modified further down with the reduced herald reservation mods on the synthesized version of the rings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As of writing this post i could get a lvl 21 wrath corrupted ring which requires lvl 36, aswell as a string of servitude with max roll (60%) increased buff effect of wrath for only 7 c total.

Level 21 herald of purity: 75c

Circle of guilt (pr. ring): \~10c

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Endgame Build Guide - Viable for all [PvE] content - Solo/Group,"**Intro**

Hi guys, I'm Lithiyum, and I decided to write this up in hopes that it may reach some struggling agents or maybe just anyone looking for direction amongst the immense amount of customization options available in D2. 

As a disclaimer, nothing in this guide is law, it is simply a guideline. There are tons of options to choose from. This guide can easily be improved and I am willing to accept criticisms as long as it is in a constructive format.

Anyway, with that out of the way, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aBCly6-O0rP4wIs80sd8MAldDYd2mSdnwCLncyrCjps/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#) is a link to the spreadsheet that you can reference for all your gearing needs. Big credits to u/Apocryphate for putting this resource together for all the agents out there. What an excellent resource. Please keep helping out this agent to complete it! Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

**Specialization**

I use demolitionist, but you can use what you like. Demolitionist works well in this build because of the bonus LMG and SMG damage. Also the grenade launcher is really good.

&amp;#x200B;

You can also use Survivalist if you like with an AR

&amp;#x200B;

**Weapons**

* **Primary** \- LMG - Clip style ones reload faster, Belt fed are slower but have a larger round count
* **Secondary** \- Your choice here. I play demo and have a chatterbox so I chose SMG for the extra damage bonus in the tree. (I'd recommend the P90 as the clip size is large already) But anything works fine. If you want something to benefit your LMG, choose a weapon that has a holstered type talent, or if you're lucky and have one, use a Merciless here.
* **Sidearm** \- Sawed off - This thing is just too good to pass up. Absolutely shreds rushers if they happen to get into the backline, but this isn't as important since you'll spend the majority of time unloading hundreds of rounds through your primary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Weapon Talents**

Since we are using LMG as primary, we have a couple options.

* **Frenzy** \- Increased damage and rate of fire when reloading from empty. This is pretty beast. Requires 4 or less armor stats (blue shield) - I use this one since the one below is a little more restrictive on damage stats (red circle icons)
* **Steady Handed** \- This one has a stacking buff per shot hit and once consumed will instantly refill your magazine. Required 5 or less attack (red circle)

&amp;#x200B;

**Armor**

Use the resource linked at the top to check these options out. Use what fits your play style best. I've just used whatever is available to me, these aren't set in stone, just pick what suits you the best:

* Mask - Dialed in - Not a whole lot of great options here just grab what you think is good.
* Vest - Tons of options here, many of which work super well. Berserk, Bloodsucker, Mad Bomber, Unstoppable Force, and Unbreakable, are all insane talents.
* Gloves - Surgical - Lots of other options, this is what I use.
* Holster - Critical - Lots of these don't even come with a talent, just use what you've got. Fill'er up is good.
* Bag - A few options here, Destructive, Hard Hitting, Hardened, On the ropes (if you use 2 skills that are on cooldown often)
* Kneepads - Patience or Cloaked - Not much else to choose from here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Brands**

Which piece this is on doesn't matter, just get whatever combination works

* 1x Petrov - For LMG damage
* 3x D&amp;H - For overall damage
* For the last 2 you can choose for yourself based on what skills you use or your own personal preference. The spreadsheet linked above has these listed in the Brand Sets tab. You can choose some defensive options or continue to seek some more damage if you like, either is fine.

&amp;#x200B;

**Stats**

Based on what talents you choose, if there any requirements, look at those and abide by them. But generally, grab crit chance, crit damage, elite damage, armor, weapon damage (both generic and specific to your weapons).

&amp;#x200B;

**Skills**

These are your own preference. Personally, I use seeker cluster and a filler based on the content I am doing. Choose what works best for you, generally there isn't a ""right"" answer for this section. If you choose demo and you want to take advantage of the tree talents, just pick skills that deal explosive damage, like seeker, artillery turret, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions?**

I'm happy to answer any questions or edit this guide with any constructive feedback. Hope this helps some agents who are a bit lost amongst all the loot or unable to choose a play style that suits them.",thedivision,74,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3fqgs/endgame_build_guide_viable_for_all_pve_content/,Guide,Lithiyum,b3fqgs,/r/thedivision/comments/b3fqgs/endgame_build_guide_viable_for_all_pve_content/,https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3fqgs/endgame_build_guide_viable_for_all_pve_content/,27,2019-03-20

As we approach endgame...,"I would like to thank r/freefolk for providing quality content throughout the years. I wasn't here at the beginning but I'm here for the end. I don't shitpost on this sub and I hardly comment but I still feel like I'm a part of a huge family around the globe. The ending to ASOIAF has been a long time coming and I'm glad that we're alive to see it. I hope this next season is the best. Whatever ending we get, I hope that it will fuel the shitposts and discussions for the off-season(?) ahead. Thanks for reading and let's buckle in for a wild ride.

Good mods for endgame LOTD moneysinks?,"Ive been wondering if there are any good mods made or in development that require huge gold money sinks that could complement the endgame of a LOTD mod build (using Lexy's last stable collection personally) since it feels when you reach a certain point in artifact collection you end up with more septims than you know what to do with.  


Best case for this is mods being those that require a direct money donation to trigger certain advancements or buildings etc, rather than sinking that money into resources for them. But anything would be great if anyone has any ideas or reccomendations. e.g. mods that let you invest, mods that let you buy upgrades and more.",skyrimmods,54,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/b3653b/good_mods_for_endgame_lotd_moneysinks/,PC SSE - Request,Asraphael,b3653b,/r/skyrimmods/comments/b3653b/good_mods_for_endgame_lotd_moneysinks/,https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/b3653b/good_mods_for_endgame_lotd_moneysinks/,15,2019-03-20

[Other] Disney's current release schedule through to 2025,"It's official - Disney now owns Fox. Which means that Disney now has the right to change Fox's own release schedule. I've spent some time merging the Disney and Fox schedules so you guys can see what it looks like right now, before any changes are made. Just before the buyout, Disney had films scheduled until 2023, and Fox had films scheduled until 2021, with the exception of the Avatar sequels which went until 2025. (When two films share the same date, they have a '/' between them)

The Deadpool movies take place after the events of Infinity War and Endgame,"https://twitter.com/VancityReynolds/status/1108002378064822272 

Because of this photo I might as well put more thought into this little headcanon of mine since the Disney Fox deal went through.

&amp;#x200B;

* Deadpool's final fight in the first film took place on a damaged helicarrier. (Although the director denies it, things have been altered in the MCU continuity to fit better with other films)
* Both Deadpool movies feature numerous references to the Avengers, with Deadpool 2 directly referencing characters like Black Widow and Hawkeye along with villains like Thanos, which means people know about what happened in Infinity War and Endgame.
* Deadpool is the only FoXmen character that's likely gonna stay the same with the merger and both films have made a great amount of money as well. (He can also easily jump into different continuities so his addition isn't entirely hard to introduce already).
* If scheduled Deadpool 3 is likely gonna be the first MCU movie with X-men characters since the first 2 films released within a 2 year span so it could likely be released in 2020.",FanTheories,38,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/b3cp5k/the_deadpool_movies_take_place_after_the_events/,,unusedreddit,b3cp5k,/r/FanTheories/comments/b3cp5k/the_deadpool_movies_take_place_after_the_events/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/b3cp5k/the_deadpool_movies_take_place_after_the_events/,14,2019-03-20

[Worldwide] Will Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 Be in the Top 10 of the Decade?,"I thought this was an interesting question.

The current Top 10 of the Decade (2010-2019)

1.) Star Wars: The Force Awakens- 2068.2M

2.) Avengers: Infinity War- 2048.4M

3.) Jurassic world- 1671.7M

4.) The Avengers- 1518.8M

5.) Furious 7- 1516.0M

6.) Avengers: Age of Ultron- 1405.4M

7.) Black Panther- 1346.9M

8.) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2- 1341.5M

9.) Star Wars:  The Last Jedi- 1332.5

10.) Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom- 1309.5

This year has two movies that are certain/near certain to pass HPDH2, Endgame and The Lion King (so TLJ and TFK are out).  On top of that there are a few movies that may or may not.  Episode 9 is the biggest contender, but there are a few other possibilities, like Frozen 2.  I think its pretty up in the air, but I'd really like to see it hang on despite how difficult it is for movies in the beginning of the decade to compete with inflation and overseas market expansion.",boxoffice,38,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/b3ifex/worldwide_will_harry_potter_and_the_deathly/,,icefire9,b3ifex,/r/boxoffice/comments/b3ifex/worldwide_will_harry_potter_and_the_deathly/,https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/b3ifex/worldwide_will_harry_potter_and_the_deathly/,63,2019-03-20
