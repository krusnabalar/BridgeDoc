[Futa4A] Meeting a futa celeb,"This is intended for a short term, celeb futa, one off RP. 

**Settings:**

**1**. You and I are long term friends that meet up after a long time. I come back to your place in our hometown right as a snowstorm begins and I end up having to spend the next day or two in your place as the roads are out of operation. It is only after a few hours that you come to learn of my secret, the one that I had been hiding from you for a long time. Your character can have a secret too, whatever it may be, regardless of your gender that you have long hidden from me and comes into the open only now.  

**2**. You are staying at a motel for a single night and you cannot sleep because of the loud sounds of sex coming through the thin walls. Frustrated, you get up and think about walking over to ask them to keep it down but it ends just as you get out of your door. You see a man leave the next room and a very familiar face peek through the gap in the door, pay him and wave goodbye. You know that face well enough and suddenly, you cannot sleep at all. You just need to find out if you would be able to get your favorite celeb, sloppy seconds though she may be. Surely, it is worth a shot at least.

**3**. You find yourself in a small but very lively bar in a rural area as you are making the trip from one city back to your hometown for Christmas. Things do get a little surreal when you think you spot me dancing in the crowd with no one else seeming all the wiser to my presence. After all, the presence of a celeb in such a rural area was not quite realistic. But when I take a break from the dancing, you see an opportunity to come over and see for yourself if I am just a look alike that is fooling your eyes in the strobing lights or I am the real deal. I am thinking of this a quickie in a back alley type situation between a celeb and a fan.

**4**. Costume party where everybody is wearing one of those fancy eye masks that do not fully conceal the identity. It is supposed to be a secretive club of sorts in a mansion. Think of something similar to the scenes from Eyes Wide Shut. When you recognize who I am, you decide to make an approach and see if the night will work out.

**5**. Rule 34/celeb mix ups: Any combinations from the below will receive first attention.

[M4F] - What’s your favorite TV Show?,"If this post is still up, I'm still looking.   18+ only

I'd love to set up a scene either with one (or More) characters from a show or movie. And really see if they're into the naughty things I've always imagined of them..

Or, their actress counterparts. Maybe a chance encounter with a fan. A filthy rendezvous with another Actor or crew member.  A contest, or an auction.

[Gloria](https://i.imgur.com/6T1u5FU.jpg) (Modern Family) So fucking amazingly hot. that accent, those curves, those fucking tits. You know she's nasty and freaky in bed. Willing to do anything to please the man she's with. She loves attention, and always knows that men are staring and drooling. She eats it up.

[Jackie](https://i.imgur.com/a7H40Qu.jpg) (That 70's Show) She's so spoiled. So sexy. So petite. Her parents paid for everything she wanted. But you know she had a few different Sugar Daddies on the side. And I bet she treats them extra special. And lets them do anything they want to her.

[Rachel](http://i.imgur.com/7SMEc.jpg) (Friends)  I mean, good lord. It must have been perpetually cold in that apartment. Her nipples were the real star of that show. Or maybe. She got a thrill knowing that people were looking. Maybe it got her a little wet if she caught one of her co-stars, or one of the crew looking at those perfect, perky tits.

[Sweet Dee](https://i.redd.it/7kdgxg8wxb9y.jpg) (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) ""Dee, you gangly, uncoordinated bitch!"" ""You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant make-up."" Sweet Dee gets shit on and fucked with so consistently, she's become completely self loathing and destructive. Now any time a guy even smiles at her she's ready to let him have all of her holes for as long as he wants, as rough as he wants. The dumb bitch.

If this is something that interests you, please send me a message. You could play as one or more of them, or just chat about them.

Kinks are: Anal/Assplay, rough fucking, choking/slapping/filthy name calling, MFF threesomes, tit fucking, age gaps, size difference, wet/sloppy blowjobs/deepthroat, drugs/drinking, cheating/getting caught.

「Jungle Boogie」,"[https://imgur.com/a/FX5JKbw](https://imgur.com/a/FX5JKbw)

&amp;#x200B;

Stand:「Jungle Boogie」ジャングル・ブーギー

Namesake: ""Jungle Boogie"" by Kool and The Gang. 

Localized Name:「Jungle Jam」

Stand Type: Automatic Close Range Shared Stand

&amp;#x200B;

Appearance:

「Jungle Boogie」manifests as a 6ft tall feminine Humnoid Stand with high Nubian features. It's exposed skin is comprised of hundreds of crystal facets; resembling a disco ball. The Stand is seemingly dressed in a skin-tight Titanium white jumpsuit ending in bell sleeves and bell bottoms. Stylistic openings for It's disco ball skin are made across the Stand's sternum and over the navel area, similar to the pattern seen on a European Black Widow. 「Jungle Boogie」has segmented violet and lush powder blue lips with half-spheres in place of ears and no nose. It's crystalline feet resemble platform shoes.

&amp;#x200B;

Abilities:

「Jungle Boogie」can absorb a reflection of light using It's crystalline skin and reposition it to project to anywhere in a 10 meter radius. If this beam of light is shone into a target's eyes, the Stand's ability will activate.「Jungle Boogie」inbues the target with a supernatural bout of Dancing Mania. They will begin dancing uncontrollably until they collapse from exhaustion, affecting anyone they physically contact to do the same. With the amount of affected people being utterly limitless, so long as there is a new unaffected person to pass it on to. Eventually, those under the influence of「Jungle Boogie」will turn violent in desperation. Attacking anyone, save the User, and destroying property using dance moves.

&amp;#x200B;

Stats:

Power: C

Speed: N/A

Range: A

Durability: C

Precision: A

Potential: A

&amp;#x200B;

If the stand get at least bronze, I want it as a new flair. If it wins, I want the theme to be Glam Rock.",fanStands,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanStands/comments/ffq5vh/jungle_boogie/,Contest entry,overlookers,ffq5vh,/r/fanStands/comments/ffq5vh/jungle_boogie/,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanStands/comments/ffq5vh/jungle_boogie/,0,2020-03-09

Respect Garrus Vakarian (Mass Effect),"##*""Fighting a rogue Spectre with countless lives at stake and no regulations to get in the way? I'd say that beats C-Sec.""*

#[Garrus Vakarian](https://i.imgur.com/GqYu6Zu.jpg)

**[OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tayibILjXA)**

Garrus Vakarian is one of not the most loyal of Shepard's squadmates throughout the Mass Effect series, and one of their closest friends. In the beginning Garrus was a skilled turian working for Citadel security, where his ""ends justify the means"" mentality caused him to often come into conflict with the leadership of C-sec. After being assigned to searching for evidence for the spectre Saren's betrayal, and being unable due to regulations, Garrus finally quit and joined forces with Commander Shepard who was also trying to reveal Saren's intentions. Garrus then joined the crew of the Normandy in order to hunt down the rogue spectre and thwart his plans to allow the Reapers (a race of sentient starships that exterminate all suitably advanced life every 50,000 years or so) to return. After Shepard's supposed death Garrus attempted to become a spectre himself, but grew fed up with all of the regulations and left for the lawless space station known as Omega. There he took up the identity of the vigilante Archangel, creating a small team to perform guerilla warfare against the gangs who ran Omega. While initially very succesful, a betrayal caused all of his team to die and Garrus himself to be holed up in his base with three rival merc groups gunning for his head. But as luck would have it, he was rescued by Commander Shepard who was coming to recruit Archangel, and Garrus joined forces with Shepard again in order to stop the Collectors from abducting human colonies. Later when the Reapers finally arrived and began their attack on all life, Garrus joined Shepard and the Normandy once again in order to find a way to defeat the Reapers once and for all.

**Notes:** A number of feats can be performed by any squadmate regardless of who they are. These feats will be marked with **[Squadmate]** and the gif is not guaranteed to have Garrus in them. Similarly, gifs of Garrus's in game abilities are performed by Shepard (since the abilities are functionally identical in game regardless of who's using them)

Tips on playing jungler assassins,"Any time how to get better in playing jungler assassins? I recently had hard time playing Black Widow, Emma Frost, Proxima Midnight, Ghost, Captain Marvel when questing for the last events. Coming from an energy main who usually take mid and just blast everything I have during team fights and call for ganks. Playing assassin is really different for me. So I wanted to learn it and use my discount reward to buy any of these assassins.

What are proper etiquette for jungling? Any tips on how to play more effectively as jungler? Among those assassins, which one is the easiest to learn? I found Black Widow to be safest since her skills are straight forward and she can traverse maps fast but I'm leaning toward Emma more because her skill combo gives the biggest damage to jungle creeps and wipe them fast. I just panic when it comes to team fights because of too many things to press to combo. I can't fathom how to play Proxima, Ghost and CM.

The Mitrokhin Archive — The Special Relationship With India [Part 1: The supremacy of the Indian National Congress],"What is The Mitrokhin Archive?

The ""Mitrokhin Archive"" is a collection of handwritten notes made secretly by KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin during his thirty years as a KGB archivist in the foreign intelligence service and the First Chief Directorate. When he defected to the United Kingdom in 1992 he brought the archive with him. [The Mitrokhin Archive Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitrokhin_Archive#India_inquiry)

A chapter from the book ‘The Mitrokhin Archive II: The KGB and the World' shows that Indira Gandhi was on the payroll of KGB. The whole nation was on the payroll of KGB and even ISI. Indira was put in place by murdering Lal Bahadur Shastri, the second PM of India, by the KGB.

# The Special Relationship With India

**Part 1: The supremacy of the Indian National Congress**

The Third World country on which the KGB eventually concentrated most operational effort during the Cold War was India. Under Stalin, however, India had been regarded as an imperialist puppet. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia dismissed Mohandas 'Mahatma' Gandhi, who led India to independence in 1947, as 'a reactionary…. who betrayed the people and helped the imperialists against them; aped the ascetics; pretended in a demagogic way to be a supporter of Indian independence and an enemy of the British; and widely exploited religious prejudice'. Despite his distaste for Stalinist attacks Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of independent India, 'had no doubt that the Soviet revolution had advanced human society by a great leap and had lit a bright flame which could not be smothered'. Though later eulogized by Soviet writers as ‘a leader of international magnitude who ranked 'among the best minds of the twentieth century', Nehru was well aware that until Stalin's death in 1953 he, like Gandhi, was regarded as a reactionary. During the early years of Indian independence, secret correspondence from Moscow to the Communist Party of India (CPI) was frequently intercepted by the Intelligence Branch (IB) in New Delhi (as it had been when the IB was working for the British Raj). According to the head of the IB, B. N. Mullik, until the early 1950s 'every instruction that had issued from Moscow had expressed the necessity and importance \[for\] the Indian Communist Party to overthrow the ""reactionary"" Nehru Government'. Early in 1951 Mullik gave Nehru a copy of the latest exhortations from Moscow to the CPI, which contained a warning that they must not fall into government hands. Nehru 'laughed out loud and remarked that Moscow apparently did not know how smart our Intelligence was'.

Neither Nehru nor the IB, however, realized how thoroughly the Indian embassy in Moscow was being penetrated by the KGB, using its usual varieties of the honey trap. The Indian diplomat PROKHOR (code name given for the Indian by KGB) was recruited, probably in the early 1950s, with the help of a female swallow (a female Russian prostitute/spy), codenamed NEVEROVA, who presumably seduced him. The KGB was clearly pleased with the material which PROKHOR provided, which included on two occasions the embassy code-book and deciphering tables, since in 1954 it increased his monthly payments from 1,000 to 4,000 rupees. Another Indian diplomat, RADAR, was recruited in 1956, also with the assistance of a swallow, who on this occasion claimed (probably falsely) to be pregnant. A third KGB swallow persuaded a cipher clerk in the Indian embassy, ARTUR, to go heavily into debt in order to make it easier to compromise him. He was recruited as an agent in 1957 after being trapped (probably into illegal currency dealing) by a KGB officer posing as a black-marketeer. As a result of these and other penetrations of the embassy, Soviet code breakers were probably able to decrypt substantial numbers of Indian diplomatic communications.

As KGB operations in India expanded during the 1950s and 1960s, the Centre seems to have discovered the extent of the IB's previous penetration of the CPI. According to a KGB report, an investigation into Promode Das Gupta, who became secretary of the Bengal Communist Party in 1959, concluded that he had been recruited by the IB in 1947. Further significant IB penetrations were discovered in the Kerala and Madras parties. By the 1960s KGB penetration of the Indian intelligence community and other parts of its official bureaucracy had enabled it to turn the tables on the IB. After the KGB became the main conduit for both money and secret communications from Moscow, high-level IB penetration of the CPI (Communist Party of India) became much more difficult. As in other Communist parties, this secret channel was known only to a small inner circle within the leadership. In 1959 the CPI General Secretary, Ajoy Ghosh, agreed With the Delhi residency on plans to fund an import-export business for trade with the Soviet bloc, headed by a senior Party member codenamed DED, whose profits would be creamed off for ""party funds”. Within little more than a decade its annual profits had grown to over 3 million rupees. The Soviet news agency Novosti provided further subsidies by routinely paying the CPI publishing House at a rate 50 percent above its normal charges.

Moscow's interest in Nehru was greatly enhanced by his emergence (together with Nasser and Tito) as one of the leaders of the Non-Aligned Movement, which began to take shape at the Bandung Conference in 1955, An exchange of official visits in the same year by Nehru and Khrushchev opened a new era in Indo-Soviet relations. On his return from India in December, Khrushchev reported to the Presidium that he had received a warm welcome, but criticized the 'primitive' portrayal of India in Soviet publications and films which demonstrated a poor grasp of Indian culture. Khrushchev was, however, clearly pleased with the intelligence and personal security provided by the KGB during his trip and proposed that the officers concerned be decorated and considered for salary increases American reliance on Pakistan as a strategic counterweight to Soviet influence in Asia encouraged India to turn to the USSR. In 1956 Nehru declared that he had never encountered a 'grosser case of naked aggression' than the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, but failed to condemn the brutal Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Uprising in the same year. India voted against a UN resolution calling for free elections in Hungary and the withdrawal of Soviet forces. The Kremlin increasingly valued Indian support as, with growing frequency, the Non-Aligned Movement tended to vote in the UN with the Soviet bloc rather than the West. During the 1960s India and the Soviet Union found further common cause against Mao's China.

Within Nehru's Congress Party government the KGB set out to cultivate its leading left-wing firebrand and Nehru's close adviser, Krishna Menon, who became Minister of Defense in 1957 after spending most of the previous decade as, successively, Indian High Commissioner in London and representative at the United Nations. To the Soviet Foreign Minister, Andrei Gromyko, 'It was……. plain that \[Menon\] was personally friendly to the Soviet Union. He would say to me heatedly: ""You cannot imagine the hatred the Indian people felt and stiff feel to the colonialists, the British…… The methods used by American capital to exploit the backward countries may be oblique, but they're just as harsh.""

In May 1962 the Soviet Presidium (which under Khrushchev replaced the Politburo) authorized the KGB residency in New Delhi to conduct active-measures operations designed to strengthen Menon's position in India and enhance his personal popularity, probably in the hope that he would become Nehru's successor. During Menon's tenure of the Defense Ministry, India's main source of arms imports switched from the West to the Soviet Union. The Indian decision in the summer of 1962 to purchase MiG-21s rather than British Lightnings was due chiefly to Menon. The British High Commissioner in New Delhi reported to London, “Krishna Menon has from the beginning managed to surround this question with almost conspiratorial official and ministerial secrecy combined with a skillful putting about of stories in favour of the MiG and against Western aircraft”. Menon's career, however, was disrupted by the Chinese invasion of India in October 1961. Having failed to take the prospect of invasion seriously until the eve of the attack, Menon found himself made the scapegoat for India's unpreparedness. Following the rout of Indian forces by the Chinese, Nehru reluctantly dismissed him on 31 October. A fortnight later, the Presidium authorized active measures by the Delhi residency, including secret finance for a newspaper which supported Menon, in a forlorn attempt to resuscitate his political career. Though similar active measures by the KGB in Menon's favour before the 1967 election also had little observable effect, a secret message to Menon from the CPSU Central Committee (probably sent by its International Department) expressed appreciation for his positive attitude to the Soviet Union.

KGB support did little to revive Menon's fortunes. Before he became Defense Minister, most of his political career had been spent outside India, including twenty eight years in Britain, where he had served for more than a decade as a Labour councilor in London. As a result, despite the personal support of some ardent disciples within the Congress Party (at least one of whom received substantial KGB funding) Menon lacked any real popular following in India itself. By the time he returned to India from foreign exiles the only language he spoke was English, he could no longer tolerate spicy Indian food and he preferred a tweed jacket and flannel trousers to traditional Indian dress. After failing to be denominated by Congress in his existing Bombay constituency for the 1967 election, Menon stood unsuccessfully as an independent. Two years later, with Communist support, he was elected as an independent in West Bengal. Some of the issues on which he campaigned suggest that he had been influenced by KGB active measures-as, for example, in his demand that American troops in Vietnam be tried for genocide and his claim that they were slitting open the wombs of pregnant women to expose their unborn babies. Well before his death in 1974, however, Menon had ceased to be an influential voice in Indian politics.

Following Menon's political eclipse, Moscow's preferred candidate to succeed Nehru after his death in May 1964, was Gulzarilal Nanda, Home Minister and number two in the cabinet. The Delhi residency was ordered to do all it could to further his candidature but to switch support to Lal Bahadur Shastri, also a close associate of Nehru, if Nanda's campaign failed. There is no indication in the files noted by Mitrokhin that the KGB was in contact with either Nanda or Shastri. Moscow's main reason for supporting them was almost certainly, negative rather than positive-to prevent the right-wing Hindu traditionalist Morarji Desai, who began each day by drinking a glass of his own urine (a practice extolled in ancient Indian medical treatises), from succeeding Nehru. In the event, after Desai had been persuaded to withdraw reluctantly from the contest, Shastri became Prime Minister with the unanimous backing of Congress. Following Shastri's sudden death in January 1966, the cabal of Congress leaders (the 'Syndicate’) chose Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi (codenamed VANO by the KGB), as his successor in the mistaken belief that she would prove a popular figurehead whom they could manipulate at will.

The KGB's first prolonged contact with Indira Gandhi had occurred during her first visit to the Soviet Union a few months after Stalin's death in 1953. As well as keeping her under continuous surveillance, the Second Chief Directorate also surrounded her with handsome, attentive male admirers. Unaware of the orchestration of her welcome by the KGB, Indira was overwhelmed by the attentions lavished on her. Though she did not mention the male admirers in letters to her father, she wrote to him, 'Everybody-the Russians-have been so sweet to me... I am being treated like everybody's only daughter-I shall be horribly spoilt by the time I leave. Nobody has ever been so nice to me.' Indira wrote of a holiday arranged for her on the Black Sea, ‘I don't think I have had such a holiday for years’. Later, in Leningrad, she told Nehru that she was 'wallowing in luxury'. Two years later Indira accompanied her father on his first official visit to the Soviet Union. Like Nehru, she was visibly impressed by the apparent successes of Soviet planning and economic modernization exhibited to them in carefully stage-managed visits to Russian factories. During her trip, Khrushchev presented her with a mink coat which became one of the favorite items in her wardrobe-despite the fact that a few years earlier she had criticized the female Indian ambassador in Moscow for accepting a similar gift.

Soviet attempts to cultivate Indira Gandhi during the 1950s were motivated far more by the desire to influence her father than by any awareness of her own political potential. Like both the Congress Syndicate and the CPI, Moscow still underestimated her when she became Prime Minister. During her early appearances in parliament, Mrs. Gandhi seemed tongue-tied and unable to think on her feet. The insulting nickname coined by a socialist MP, 'Dumb Doll’ began to stick. Moscow's strategy during 1966 for the Indian elections in the following year was based on encouraging the CPI and the breakaway Communist Party of India, Marxist (CPM) to join together in a left-wing alliance to oppose Mrs. Gandhi and the Congress government. As well as subsidizing the CPI and some other left-wing groups during the 1967 election campaign, the KGB also funded the campaigns of several agents and confidential contacts within Congress. The most senior agent identified in the files noted by Mitrokhin was a minister codenamed ABAD, who was regarded by the KGB as 'extremely influential'.

During the election campaign, the KGB also made considerable use of active measures, many of them based on forged American documents produced by Service A. An agent in the information department of the US embassy in New Delhi, codenamed MIKHAIL, provided examples of documents and samples of signatures to assist in the production of convincing forgeries. Among the operations officers who publicized the forgeries produced for the 1967 election campaign was Yuri Modin, former controller of the Cambridge 'Magnificent Five'. In an attempt to discredit S.K. Patil, one of the leading anti-Communists in the Congress Syndicate, Modin circulated a forged letter from the US consul-general in Bombay to the American ambassador in New Delhi referring to Patil’s political intrigues with the Pakistanis' and to the large American subsidies supposedly given to him. Though Patil was one of the most senior Congress politicians defeated at the election, it remains difficult to assess how much his defeat owed to KGB active measures. Modin also publicized a bogus telegram to London from the British High Commissioner, John Freeman, reporting that the United States was giving vast sums to right-wing parties and politicians. The fact that the KGB appears to have had no agent like MIKHAIL in the High Commission, however, led Service A on this occasion to make an embarrassing error. Its forgery mistakenly described the British High Commissioner as Sir John Freeman.

Other Service A fabrications had much greater success. Among them was a forged letter purporting to come from Gordon Goldstein of the US Office of Naval Research and revealing the existence of (in reality non-existent) American bacteriological warfare weapons in Vietnam and Thailand. Originally published in the Bombay ‘Free Press Journal’, the letter was reported in the London ‘Times’ on 7 March 1968 and used by Moscow Radio in broadcasts beamed at Asia as proof that the United States had spread epidemics in Vietnam. The Indian weekly ‘Blitz’ headlined a story based on the same forgery, ‘US Admits Biological and Nuclear Warfare'. Goldstein's signature and official letterhead were subsequently discovered to have been copied from an invitation to an international scientific symposium circulated by him the previous year.

After the elections of February 1967, the KGB claimed, doubtless optimistically, that it was able to influence 30 to 40 percent of the new parliament. Congress lost 21 percent of its seats. The conflict between Indira Gandhi and her chief rival Morarji Desai made its forty-four-seat majority precarious and obliged her to accept Desai as Deputy Prime Minister. By 1968 Desai and Kamaraj, the head of the Syndicate, were agreed on the need to replace Mrs. Gandhi. Congress was moving inexorably towards a split.

During 1969 there were major policy reorientations in both Moscow and Delhi. The growing threat from China persuaded the Kremlin to make a special relationship with India the basis of its South Asian policy. Simultaneously, Mrs. Gandhi set out to secure left-wing support against the Syndicate. In July 1969 she nationalized fourteen commercial banks. Desai was sacked as Finance Minister and resigned as Deputy Prime Minister- Encouraged by Moscow, the CPI swung its support behind Mrs. Gandhi. By infiltrating its members and sympathizers into the left-wing Congress Forum for Socialist Action (codenamed SECTOR by the KGB), the CPI set out to gain a position of influence within the ruling party. In November the Syndicate declared Mrs. Gandhi guilty of defiance of the Congress leadership and dismissed her from the: parry, which then split in two: Congress (O), which followed the Syndicate line, and Congress (R), which supported Mrs. Gandhi. The Syndicate hinted that Mrs. Gandhi intended to 'sell' India to the Soviet Union and was using her principal private secretary, Parmeshwar Narain Haksar, as a direct link with Moscow and the Soviet embassy.

From 1967 to 1973 Haksar, a former protégé of Krishna Menon, was Mrs. Gandhi's most trusted adviser. One of her biographers, Katherine Frank, describes him as 'a magnetic figure' who became 'probably the most influential and powerful person in the government' as well as 'the most important civil servant in the country'. Haksar set out to turn a civil service which at least in principle, was politically neutral into an ideologically 'committed bureaucracy'. His was the hand that guided Mrs. Gandhi through her turn to the left, the nationalization of the banks and the split in the Congress Party, It was Haksar also who was behind the transfer of control of the intelligence community to the Prime Minister's Secretariat. His advocacy of the leftward turn in Mrs. Gandhi's policies sprang, however, from his socialist convictions rather than from manipulation by the KGB. But both he and Mrs. Gandhi 'were less fastidious than Nehru had been about interfering with the democratic system and structure of government to attain their ideological ends'. The journalist Inder Malhotra noted the growth of a ‘courtier culture' in Indira Gandhi's entourage: 'The power centre in the world's largest democracy was slowly turning into a durbar'. At the elections of February 1971 Mrs. Gandhi won a landslide victory. With seventy seats more than the undivided Congress had won in 1967, her Congress (R) had a two-thirds majority. The Congress Forum for Socialist Action had the support of about 100 MPs in the new parliament. Mrs. Gandhi made its most vocal spokesman, the former Communist Mohan Kumaramangalam, Minister of Mines; one of his first acts was the nationalization of the coal industry. Kumaramangalam seemed to be implementing a 'thesis' which he had first argued in 1964: that since the CPI could not win power by itself, as many of its members and sympathizers as possible should join the Congress, make common cause with 'progressive' Congressmen and compel the party leadership to implement socialist policies. Another leading figure in the Congress Forum for Socialist Action was recruited in 1971 as Agent RERO and paid about 100,000 rupees a year for what the KGB considered important political intelligence as well as acting as an agent recruiter. His controllers included the future head of the FCD, Leonid Shebarshin (codenamed VERNOV).

In August 1971 Mrs. Gandhi signed a Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Co-operation with the Soviet Union, According to the Permanent Secretary at the Indian Foreign Office, T.N. Kaul, it was one of the few closely guarded secret negotiations that India has ever conducted. On \[the Indian\] side, hardly half a dozen people were aware of it, including the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. The media got no scent of it. A delighted Gromyko declared at the signing ceremony, ‘The significance of the Treaty cannot be over-estimated.' Mrs. Gandhi's popularity among the Soviet people, he later claimed, was demonstrated by the large number of Soviet babies who were given the unusual name Indira. The Soviet Union seemed to be guaranteed the support of the leading power in the Non-Aligned Movement. Both countries immediately issued a joint communiqué calling for the withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam. India was able to rely on Soviet arms supplies and diplomatic support in the conflict against Pakistan which was already in the offing. According to Leonid Shebarshin, who was posted to New Delhi as head of Line PR (political intelligence) at a time when 'Soviet military Technology was flowing into India in an endless stream', the Centre-unlike many in the Foreign Ministry-concluded that war was inevitable. Shebarshin realized that war had begun when the lights went out in the middle of a diplomatic reception at the Soviet embassy on 2 December. Looking out of the window, Shebarshin saw that the power cut affected the whole of the capital. Leaving the embassy hurriedly, he drove to a phone box some way away to ring a member of the residency's agent network who confirmed that hostilities had started. Another member of the network arranged a meeting between Shebarshin and a senior Indian military commander:

It would fit an understatement to say that the general's mood was optimistic. He knew precisely when and how the war would end: on 16 December with the surrender of Dacca \[later renamed Dhaka\] and capitulation of the Pakistani army \[in East Pakistan\]... They were in no stare to resist and would not defend Dacca, because they had no one from whom to expect help. 'We know the Pakistani army', my interlocutor said, ‘Any professional soldiers would behave the same way in their place'.

Despite diplomatic support from both the United States and China, Pakistan suffered a crushing defeat in the fourteen-day war with India. East Pakistan gained independence as Bangladesh, West Pakistan, reduced to a nation of only 55 million people, could no longer mount a credible challenge to India. For most Indians it was Mrs. Gandhi’s finest hour. A Soviet diplomat at the United Nations exulted, ‘This is the first time in history that the United States and China have been defeated together!'

In the Centre, the Indo-Soviet special relationship was also celebrated as a triumph for the KGB. The residency in New Delhi was rewarded by being upgraded to the status of 'main residency'. Its head from 1970 to 1975, Yakov Prokofyevich Medyanik, was accorded the title of 'main resident', while the heads of Lines PR (political intelligence), KR (counter-intelligence) and X (scientific and technological intelligence) were each given the rank of resident-not, as elsewhere, deputy resident. Medyanik also had overall supervision of three other residencies, located in the Soviet consulates at Bombay, Calcutta and Madras, In the early 1970s, the KGB presence in India became one of the largest in the world outside the Soviet bloc, Indira Gandhi placed no limit on the number of Soviet diplomats and trade officials, thus allowing the KGB and GRU as many cover positions as they wished. Nor, like many other states, did India object to admitting Soviet intelligence officers who had been expelled by less hospitable regimes. The expansion of KGB operations in the Indian subcontinent (and first and foremost in India) during the early 1970s led the FCD to create a new department. Hitherto operations in India, as in the rest of non-Communist South and South-East Asia, had been the responsibility of the Seventh Department. In 1974 the newly founded Seventeenth Department was given charge of the Indian subcontinent.

Oleg Kalugin, who became head of FCD Directorate K (Counter-intelligence) in 1973, remembers India as 'a model of KGB infiltration of a Third World government': 'We had scores of sources throughout the Indian government-in intelligence, counter-intelligence, the Defense and Foreign Ministries, and the police'. In Directorate K, whose responsibilities included the penetration of foreign intelligence and security agencies, was running, through Line KR in the Indian residencies, over thirty agents — ten of whom were Indian intelligence officers. Kalugin recalls one occasion on which Andropov personally turned down an offer from an Indian minister to provide information in return for $50,000 on the grounds that the KGB was already well supplied with material from the Indian Foreign and Defense Ministries. It seemed like the entire country was for sale; the KGB-and the CIA-had deeply penetrated the Indian government. After a while neither side entrusted sensitive information to the Indians, realizing their enemy would know all about it the next day.

The KGB, in Kalugin's view, was more successful than the CIA, partly because of its skill in exploiting the corruption which became endemic under Indira Gandhi's regime. As Inder Malhotra noted, though corruption was not new in India:

People expected Indira Gandhi's party, committed to bringing socialism to the country, to be more honest and cleaner than the old undivided Congress, But this turned out to be a vain hope. On the contrary, compared with the amassing of wealth by some of her close associates, the misdeeds of the discarded Syndicate leaders once looked upon as godfathers of corrupt Congressmen, began to appear trivial.

Suitcases full of banknotes were said to be routinely taken to the Prime Minister's house. Former Syndicate member S.K. Patil is reported to have said that Mrs. Gandhi did not even return the suitcases.

The Prime Minister is unlikely to have paid close attention to the dubious origins of some of the funds which went into Congress's coffers. That was a matter which she left largely to her principal fundraiser, Lalit Narayan Mishra, who-though she doubtless did not realize it also accepted Soviet money. On at least one occasion a secret gift of 2 million rupees from the Politburo to Congress (R) was personally delivered after midnight by the head of Line PR in New Delhi, Leonid Shebarshin. Another million rupees were given on the same occasion to a newspaper which supported Mrs. Gandhi. Short and obese with several chins, Mishra looked the part of the corrupt politician he increasingly became. Indira Gandhi, despite her own frugal lifestyle, depended on the money he collected from a variety of sources to finance Congress (R). So did her son and anointed heir, Sanjay, whose misguided ambition to build an Indian popular car and become India's Henry Ford depended on government favours, When Mishra was assassinated in 1975, Mrs. Gandhi blamed a plot involving 'foreign elements’, a phrase which she doubtless intended as a euphemism for the CIA. The New Delhi main residency gave his widow 70,000 rupees from its active-measures budget. Though there were some complaints from the CPI leadership at the use of Soviet funds to support Mrs. Gandhi and Congress (R), 60 covert funding for the CPI seems to have been unaffected. By 1972 the import-export business founded by the CPI a decade earlier to trade with the Soviet Union had contributed more than 10 million rupees to Party funds. Other secret subsidies, totaling at least 1.5 million rupees, had gone to state Communist parties, individuals and media associated with the CPI. The funds which were sent from Moscow to Party headquarters via the KGB were larger still. In the first six months of 1975 alone they amounted to over 2.5 million rupees.

In the mid-1970s Soviet funds for the CPI were passed by operations officers of the New Delhi main residency to a senior member of the Party's National Council codenamed BANKIR at a number of different locations. The simplest transfers of funds occurred when KGB officers under diplomatic cover had a pretext to visit BANKIR's office, such as his briefings for visiting press delegations from the Soviet bloc. Other arrangements, however, were much more complex- One file noted by Mitrokhin records a fishing expedition to a lake not far from Delhi arranged to provide cover for a transfer of funds to BANKIR. Shebarshin and two operations officers from the main residency left the embassy at 6.30 a.m., arrived at about 8 a.m. and spent two and a half hours fishing. At 10.30 a.m. they left the lake and headed to an agreed rendezvous point with BANKIR, making visual contact with his car at 11.15. As the residency car overtook his on a section of the road which could not be observed from either side, packages of banknotes were passed through the open window of BANKlR's car. Rajeshwar Rao, general secretary of the CPI from 1964 to 1990, subsequently provided receipts for the sums received. Further substantial sums went to the Communist-Led All-India Congress of Trade Unions, headed by S.A. Dange.

India under Indira Gandhi was also probably the arena for more KGB active measures than anywhere else in the world, though their significance appears to have been considerably exaggerated by the Centre, which overestimated its ability to manipulate Indian opinion. According to KGB files, by 1973 it had ten Indian newspapers on its payroll (which cannot be identified for legal reasons) as well as a press agency under its control. During 1972 the KGB claimed to have planted 3,789 articles in Indian newspapers-probably more than in any other country in the non-Communist world. According to its files, the number fell to 2,760 in 1973 but rose to 4,486 in 1974 and 5,510 in 1975.66 In some major NATO countries, despite active-measures campaigns, the KGB was able to plant little more than 1 percent of the articles which it placed in the Indian press.

Among the KGB's leading confidential contacts in the press was one of India's most influential journalists, codenamed NOK, Recruited as a confidential contact in 1976 by A.A. Arkhipov, NOK was subsequently handled by two Line PR officers operating under journalistic cover: first A.I. Khachaturian, officially a Trud correspondent, then V.N. Cherepakhin of the Novosti news agency. NOK's file records that he published material favorable to the Soviet Union and provided information on the entourage of Indira Gandhi. Contact with him ceased in 1980 as a result of his deteriorating health. Though not apparently aware of the KGB's involvement in the active-measures campaign, P.N. Dhar believed that the left was 'manipulating the press... to keep Mrs. Gandhi committed to their ideological line'. India was also one of the most favorable environments for Soviet front organizations. From 1966 to 1986 the head of the most important of them, the World Peace Council (WPC), was the Indian Communist Romesh Chandra. In his review of the 1960s at the WPC-sponsored World Peace Congress I, Chandra denounced 'the US-dominated NATO' as 'the greatest threat to peace' across the world: 'The fangs of NATO can be felt in Asia and Africa as well \[as Europe\]… The forces of imperialism and exploitation, particularly NATO... bear the responsibility for the hunger and poverty of hundreds of millions all over the world.'

The KGB was also confident of its ability to organize mass demonstrations in Delhi and other major cities. In 1969, for example Andropov informed the Politburo, 'The KGB residency in India has the opportunity to organize a protest demonstration of up to 20,000 Muslims in front of the US embassy in India-The cost of the demonstration would be 5,000 rupees and would be covered in the... budget for special tasks in India. I request consideration'. Brezhnev wrote 'Agreed' on Andropov's request. In April 1971, two months after Mrs. Gandhi's landslide election victory, the Politburo approved the establishment of a secret fund of 1.5 million convertible rubles (codenamed DEPO) to fund active-measures operations in India over the next four years. During that period KGB reports from New Delhi claimed on slender evidence, to have assisted the success of Congress (R) in elections to state assemblies.

Among the most time-consuming active measures implemented by Leonid Shebarshin as head of Line PR were the preparations for Brezhnev's state visit in 1973. As usual it was necessary to ensure that the General Secretary was received with what appeared to be rapturous enthusiasm and to concoct evidence that his platitudinous speeches were hailed as 'major political statements of tremendous importance'. Since Brezhnev was probably the dreariest orator among the world's major statesmen this was no easy task, particularly when he traveled outside the Soviet bloc. Soviet audiences were used to listening respectfully to his long-winded utterances and to bursting into regular, unwarranted applause. Indian audiences, however, lacked the experience of their Soviet counterparts. Brezhnev would have been affronted by any suggestion that he deliver only a short address, since he believed in a direct correlation between the length of a speech and the prestige of the speaker. His open-air speech in the great square in front of Delhi's famous Red Fort, where Nehru had declared Indian independence twenty-six years earlier, thus presented a particular challenge. According to possibly inflated KGB estimates, 2 million people were present-perhaps the largest audience to whom Brezhnev had ever spoken. As Shebarshin later acknowledged, the speech was extraordinarily long winded and heavy going. The embassy had made matters even worse by translating the speech into a form of high Hindi which was incomprehensible to most of the audience. As the speech droned on and night began to fall, some of the audience started to drift away but, according to Shebarshin, were turned back by the police for fear of offending the Soviet leader. Though even Brezhnev sensed that not all was well, he was later reassured by the practiced sycophants in his entourage.

Shebarshin was able to persuade both himself and the Centre that the visit as a whole had been a great success. The KGB claimed much of the credit for 'creating favorable conditions' for Brezhnev's Indian triumph.

Leonid Shebarshin's perceived success in active measures as head of Line PR almost certainly helps to explain his promotion to the post of main resident in 1975 and launched him on a career which in 1988 took him to the leadership of the FCD. In a newspaper interview after his retirement from the KGB, Shebarshin spoke 'nostalgically about the old days, about disinformation- forging documents, creating sensations for the press'. It was doubtless his days in India which he had chiefly in mind. Among the KGB's most successful active measures were those which claimed to expose CIA plots in the subcontinent. The Centre was probably right to claim the credit for persuading Indira Gandhi that the Agency was plotting her overthrow. In November 1973 she told Fidel Castro at a banquet in New Delhi, 'What they \[the CIA\] have done to Allende they want to do to me also. There are people here, connected with the same foreign forces that acted in Chile, who would like to eliminate me.' She did not question Castro's (and the KGB's) insistence that Allende had been murdered in cold blood by Pinochet's US-backed troops. The belief that the Agency had marked her out for the same fate as Allende became something of an obsession. In an obvious reference to (accurate) American claims that, in reality, Allende had turned his gun on himself during the storming of his palace, Mrs. Gandhi declared, 'When I am murdered, they will say I arranged it myself'.

Mrs. Gandhi was also easily persuaded that the CIA, rather than the mistakes of her own administration, was responsible for the growing opposition to her government. Early in 1974 riots in Gujarat, which killed over 100 people, led to 8,000 arrests and caused the dissolution of the State Assembly, reinforced her belief In an American conspiracy against her. Irritated by a series of speeches by Mrs. Gandhi denouncing the ever-present menace of CIA subversion, the US ambassador in New Delhi, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ordered an investigation which uncovered two occasions during her father's premiership when the CIA had secretly provided funds to help the Communists' opponents in state elections, once in Kerala (money provided to the Christian church for the 'Vimochana Samaram') and once in West Bengal- According to Moynihan: 

Both times the money was given to the Congress Party which had asked for it-Once it was given to Mrs. Gandhi herself, who was then a party official.

Still, as we were no longer giving any money to her it was understandable that she should wonder to whom we were giving it. It is not a practice to be encouraged.

A brief visit to India by Henry Kissinger in October 1974 provided another opportunity for a KGB active-measures campaign. Agents of influence were given further fabricated stories about CIA conspiracies to report to the Prime Minister and other leading figures in the government and parliament. The KGB claimed to have planted over seventy stories in the Indian press condemning CIA subversion as well as initiating letter-writing and poster campaigns. The Delhi main residency claimed that, thanks to its campaign, Mrs. Gandhi had raised the question of CIA operations in India during her talks with Kissinger.

On 28 April 1975 Andropov approved a further Indian active-measures operation to publicize fabricated evidence of CIA subversion. Sixteen packets containing incriminating material prepared by Service A on three CIA officers stationed under diplomatic cover at the US embassy were sent anonymously by the Delhi residency to the media and gave rise to a series of articles in the Indian press. According to KGB files, Mrs. Gandhi sent a personal letter to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, enclosing some of the KGB's forged CIA documents and a series of articles in Indian newspapers which had been taken in by them. The same files report that Mrs. Bandaranaike concluded that CIA subversion posed such a serious threat to Sri Lanka that she set up a committee of investigation.

One of Mrs. Gandhi's critics, Piloo Moody, ridiculed her obsession with CIA subversion by wearing around his neck a medallion with the slogan, 'I am a CIA agent'. For Mrs. Gandhi, however, the Agency was no laughing matter. By the summer of 1975 her suspicions of a vast conspiracy by her political opponents, aided and abetted by the CIA, had, in the opinion of her biographer Katherine Frank, grown to 'something close to paranoia'. Her mood was further darkened on 12 June by a decision of the Allahabad High Court, against which she appealed, invalidating her election as MP on the grounds of irregularities in the 1971 elections. A fortnight later she persuaded both the President and the cabinet to agree to the declaration of a state of emergency.

Triumph or die episode 7: Reaper vs Noob Saibot,"At the Lin Kuei temple, Widowmaker, Doomfist, Moira, Sombra, Sigma and Reaper, the former Overwatch operative turned talon’s agent of death. They wander about at temple so they can gather some information 



Reaper: Sombra. Is anyone here?



Sombra: no. There shouldn’t be anybody here. This is an abandoned temple because the guys here were cyborgs? Sound dragons? I dunno. 



Widowmaker: even still we can take them on. 



Suddenly, some black portals that can fit a man appear out of thin air. 



Doomfist: looks like we can finally have some fun!



Then through the portals, Noob Saibot, the Lon Kuei assassin turned Netherrealm wraith pops through them.



Reaper: death walks among you. 



Noob: you fool, I have become death personified. 



Sombra: you look like death warmed over. 



Noob: a small child. You clearly fail any experience similar to your peers. 



Reaper: Sombra. Everyone. Leave this one to me. This will be one of the places we take over



Noob: name one area you control. 



Widowmaker: I like this one 



Reaper: of course you would. Anyone that apparently just verbally attacks me would be all you like coming from a literal widow maker. I’ll kill your husband! I’ll kill her husband! I’ll even kill my own-



Reaper realizes what he’s done



Reaper: oh my god. Fuck. 



Widowmaker: no. No. Please. Continue. Continue what you’re about to say. 



She turns on her visor and aims her gun at Reaper



Widowmaker: say that to all 8 of my eyes again!



Noob: you fail to control your little entourage. 



Reaper: if you are so confident in that, let me show you my power 



Reaper takes out his dual shotguns



Noob Saibot: fear me.

Using the base of the Amber described above the resin has been turned into a fossilized perfume resin from ancient recipes and then turned back into perfume oil diluting nothing only the use of Alchemy and inspiring this scent to be made and created for the Goddess Sekhmet. What is different with Sekhmet Amber – is noting the magic gone into this creation; apply and forget. A strong powerful Goddess that brings the strength of Patchouli and arises from your skin with the amber essence undertones.

A possible community Warframe idea I’ve had for a few years called Arachnus.,"When I was in high school I used to sketch warframe ideas (I don’t have any of them anymore) but I do remember a lot of them, most were kinda dumb but I liked this one a lot. 
Arachnus is a fast fighting spider themed warframe. It has. 8 eyes but only the normal four legs. It has a black and silver default aesthetic with a symbol on its chest like that of a black widow. It has a Ability 1 is called “Web” and it is used to catch a single target in a web for 25 energy. Ability 2 is “Consume” and Arachnus sprouts four extra appendages and attacks a single target dealing slashing and poison damage. Ability 3 is “Spider-Climb” and with this Arachnus can climb on walls as if they were floors with increased speed with a timer energy drain. The final ability is “Widow Maker,” and it turns Arachnus into a full on giant spider with 8 legs, large teeth and mandables. While in this form Arachnus will also have an Exemus like aura of poison around it dealing damage to all in a radius. This ability will also be timer based. 

Anyone have any thoughts. I’m open to ideas about this.",Warframe,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/ffpk5s/a_possible_community_warframe_idea_ive_had_for_a/,Suggestion,djackkeddy,ffpk5s,/r/Warframe/comments/ffpk5s/a_possible_community_warframe_idea_ive_had_for_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/ffpk5s/a_possible_community_warframe_idea_ive_had_for_a/,9,2020-03-09

Brandon Stark/Jaime Lannister (Spoilers Extended),"During ACOK  there is this well known exchange between Jaime/Cat:

&gt;**""Brandon was different from his brother, wasn't he? He had blood in his veins instead of cold water. More like me.""**

&gt;""Brandon was nothing like you."" 

&gt;""If you say so. You and he were to wed."" -ACOK, Catelyn VII


**In this post, I wanted to explore some other similarities/differences between Brandon Stark and Jaime.**

***

#Appearance/Character 

They are both described as tall/handsome men who were excellent swordsmen/jousters:

**Brandon:**

&gt;She remembered her own childish disappointment, the first time she had laid eyes on Eddard Stark. **She had pictured him as a younger version of his brother Brandon, but that was wrong. Ned was shorter and plainer of face, and so somber. He spoke courteously enough, but beneath the words she sensed a coolness that was all at odds with Brandon, whose mirths had been as wild as his rages.** Even when he took her maidenhood, their love had more of duty to it than of passion. We made Robb that night, though; we made a king together. And after the war, at Winterfell, I had love enough for any woman, once I found the good sweet heart beneath Ned's solemn face. There is no reason Edmure should not find the same, with his Roslin. -ASOS, Catelyn V

and:

&gt;**Brandon was the best of the Starks with sword in hand, and the best jouster as well.** But Benjen has other skills that serve him well as a ranger... and Ned was likely the best battle commander. -[SSM, About Brandon Stark: 15 December 2000](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Benjen_Stark)

**Jaime:**

&gt;He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen's brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which. **Ser Jaime Lannister was twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife.** He wore crimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was embroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and whispered ""Kingslayer"" behind his back. -AGOT, Jon I

and:

&gt;The boy from the Basilisk Isles, for a start. Tumco Lho. Black as maester's ink he was, but fast and strong, **the best natural swordsman Selmy had seen since Jaime Lannister.** -ADWD, The Kingbreaker

and:

&gt;**Brienne remembered her fight with Jaime Lannister in the woods. It had been all that she could do to keep his blade at bay. He was weak from his imprisonment, and chained at the wrists. No knight in the Seven Kingdoms could have stood against him at his full strength, with no chains to hamper him. Jaime had done many wicked things, but the man could fight!** His maiming had been monstrously cruel. It was one thing to slay a lion, another to hack his paw off and leave him broken and bewildered. -AFFC, Brienne I

and:

&gt;""I was watching from across the yard. You did very well, Tommen. I would expect no less of you. **Jousting is in your blood. One day you shall rule the lists, as your father did.""**

&gt;""No man will stand before him."" Margaery Tyrell gave the queen a coy smile. ""But I never knew that King Robert was so accomplished at the joust. Pray tell us, Your Grace, what tourneys did he win? What great knights did he unseat? I know the king should like to hear about his father's victories."" 

&gt;A flush crept up Cersei's neck. The girl had caught her out. **Robert Baratheon had been an indifferent jouster, in truth. During tourneys he had much preferred the mêlée, where he could beat men bloody with blunted axe or hammer. It had been Jaime she had been thinking of when she spoke.** It is not like me to forget myself. ""Robert won the tourney of the Trident,"" she had to say. ""He overthrew Prince Rhaegar and named me his queen of love and beauty. I am surprised you do not know that story, good-daughter."" She gave Margaery no time to frame a reply. ""Ser Osmund, help my son from his armor, if you would be so good. Ser Loras, walk with me. I need a word with you."" -AFFC, Cersei V

***

#Love of Horses

&gt;The lantern light in her eyes made them seem as if they were afire. ""Brandon was fostered at Barrowton with old Lord Dustin, the father of the one I'd later wed, but he spent most of his time riding the Rills. He loved to ride. His little sister took after him in that. A pair of centaurs, those two. And my lord father was always pleased to play host to the heir to Winterfell. -ADWD, The Turncloak

and:

&gt;You stupid girl, the queen thought, angry even now. Jaime does not even know you are alive. **Back then her brother lived only for swords and dogs and horses . . . and for her, his twin.** -AFFC, Cersei VIII

and:

&gt;His palfrey was a blood bay, his destrier a magnificent grey stallion. **It had been long years since Jaime had named any of his horses; he had seen too many die in battle, and that was harder when you named them.** But when the Piper boy started calling them Honor and Glory, he laughed and let the names stand.  -AFFC, Jaime III

***

#Tully Women

&gt;""Our duty."" Catelyn's face was drawn as she started across the yard. I have always done my duty, she thought. Perhaps that was why her lord father had always cherished her best of all his children. Her two older brothers had both died in infancy, so she had been son as well as daughter to Lord Hoster until Edmure was born. Then her mother had died and her father had told her that she must be the lady of Riverrun now, and she had done that too. And **when Lord Hoster promised her to Brandon Stark, she had thanked him for making her such a splendid match**. -ACOK, Catelyn VI

and:

&gt;Jaime, meantime, had spent four years as squire to Ser Sumner Crake-hall and earned his spurs against the Kingswood Brotherhood. But when he made a brief call at King's Landing on his way back to Casterly Rock, chiefly to see his sister, Cersei took him aside and whispered that **Lord Tywin meant to marry him to Lysa Tully, had gone so far as to invite Lord Hoster to the city to discuss dower.** But if Jaime took the white, he could be near her always. Old Ser Harlan Grandison had died in his sleep, as was only appropriate for one whose sigil was a sleeping lion. Aerys would want a young man to take his place, so why not a roaring lion in place of a sleepy one? -ASOS, Jaime II

***

#Actions

&gt;""He was on his way to Riverrun when . . ."" Strange, how telling it still made her throat grow tight, after all these years. "". . . when he heard about Lyanna, and went to King's Landing instead. It was a rash thing to do."" **She remembered how her own father had raged when the news had been brought to Riverrun. The gallant fool, was what he called Brandon.** 

&gt;Jaime poured the last half cup of wine. **""He rode into the Red Keep with a few companions, shouting for Prince Rhaegar to come out and die.** But Rhaegar wasn't there. Aerys sent his guards to arrest them all for plotting his son's murder. The others were lords' sons too, it seems to me."" -ACOK, Catelyn VII

as compared to:

&gt;Littlefinger walked his horse forward, step by careful step. ""What is the meaning of this? This is the Hand of the King.""

&gt;""He was the Hand of the King."" The mud muffled the hooves of the blood bay stallion. The line parted before him. On a golden breastplate, the lion of Lannister roared its defiance. ""Now, if truth be told, I'm not sure what he is."" 

&gt;""Lannister, this is madness,"" Littlefinger said. ""Let us pass. We are expected back at the castle. What do you think you're doing?"" 

&gt;…

&gt;**Jaime Lannister poked at Ned's chest with the gilded sword that had sipped the blood of the last of the Dragonkings.** ""Would she? The noble Catelyn Tully of Riverrun murder a hostage? I think … not."" He sighed. ""But I am not willing to chance my brother's life on a woman's honor."" Jaime slid the golden sword into its sheath. ""So I suppose I'll let you run back to Robert to tell him how I frightened you. I wonder if he'll care."" Jaime pushed his wet hair back with his fingers and wheeled his horse around. When he was beyond the line of swordsmen, he glanced back at his captain. ""Tregar, see that no harm comes to Lord Stark."" -AGOT, Eddard IX

and:

&gt;She ignored the jest. **""If it was Father who'd been taken captive, Jaime would not be sitting by idly, I promise you.""**

&gt;**Jaime would be battering his host to bloody bits against the walls of Riverrun, and the Others take their chances. He never did have any patience**, no more than you, sweet sister. ""Not all of us can be as bold as Jaime, but there are other ways to win wars. Harrenhal is strong and well situated. -ACOK, Tyrion V

***

#A Few Other Random Quotes:

&gt;Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. ""Poison, well … that could be the dwarf's work, true enough. Or Cersei's. It's said poison is a woman's weapon, begging your pardons, my lady. **The Kingslayer, now … I have no great liking for the man, but he's not the sort. Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his.** Was it poison, my lady?""  -AGOT, Catelyn VII

and:

&gt;""He would hate that."" She pulled off her glove and touched his knee, pale flesh against dark stone. ""Brandon loved his sword. He loved to hone it. 'I want it sharp enough to shave the hair from a woman's cunt,' he used to say. And how he loved to use it.** 'A bloody sword is a beautiful thing,' he told me once.""**  -ADWD, The Turncloak

and:

&gt;He is blunt. Very well. ""Jaime . . . I felt so lost with Father dead, I scarce knew what I was saying. **Jaime is gallant, but a bit of a fool**, let us be frank. Tommen needs a more seasoned man. Someone older . . .""  -AFFC, Cersei II

and:

&gt;""He was on his way to Riverrun when . . ."" Strange, how telling it still made her throat grow tight, after all these years. "". . . when he heard about Lyanna, and went to King's Landing instead. It was a rash thing to do."" **She remembered how her own father had raged when the news had been brought to Riverrun. The gallant fool, was what he called Brandon.**  -ACOK, Catelyn VII


***

#One Major Difference

&gt;""I find nothing about you amusing, Kingslayer.""

&gt;""That name again. I don't think I'll fuck you after all, Littlefinger had you first, didn't he? I never eat off another man's trencher. Besides, you're not half so lovely as my sister."" His smile cut. **""I've never lain with any woman but Cersei.** In my own way, I have been truer than your Ned ever was. Poor old dead Ned. So who has shit for honor now, I ask you? What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"" - ACOK, Catelyn VII

and:

&gt;The lantern light in her eyes made them seem as if they were afire. ""Brandon was fostered at Barrowton with old Lord Dustin, the father of the one I'd later wed, but he spent most of his time riding the Rills. He loved to ride. His little sister took after him in that. A pair of centaurs, those two. And my lord father was always pleased to play host to the heir to Winterfell. My father had great ambitions for House Ryswell. He would have served up my maidenhead to any Stark who happened by, but there was no need. **Brandon was never shy about taking what he wanted.** I am old now, a dried-up thing, too long a widow, but I still remember the look of my maiden's blood on his cock the night he claimed me. I think Brandon liked the sight as well. A bloody sword is a beautiful thing, yes. It hurt, but it was a sweet pain. -ADWD, The Turncloak

and:

&gt;It'd be an exaggeration to say that Brandon died before he could have children. **It's established in the books that he was no virgin. He could very well have left behind some little Snows in the various places he visited.** But what's absolutely clear is that he had no legitimate children. -[SSM, Asshai.com Interview in Barcelona: 28 July 2012](https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona/)

[M4A playing F] Super Heroines to Super Sluts,"So the set up is simple you will be a Super Heroine and I will be a Super villain. In a battle between us you soon find yourself out classed and soon begging for mercy. However you find that I have no intention of killing you and instead have a different plan. I plan on stripping you naked and turning you into my own little sex slave. Of course you refuse but I give you an ultimatum; Do what I say, or everyone in the town you protect will be killed.

With no other choice you force yourself to listen to me. You get stripped down, forced into humiliating outfits, and even getting mocked by the people you use to save. It doesn't help that I often force you to say that you love being my sex slave and that I am not forcing you in the slightest to do this. Before long I'm proven right as not only do you start to enjoy this but you find yourself begging for more and wanting to be humiliated by me.

For who you would play I am fine if you want to play an OC but if you want to go with some fandom heroes from Marvel or DC, Well here are my favorites.

DC: Wonder Woman, Power Girl, Zatanna, Black Canary, Bat Girl, Raven, Star Fire

Marvel: Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Spider Gwen, Scarlet Witch

Kinks: anal, oral, spanking, hyper cocks, public sex, pet play, lactation, humiliation, mind break

All of my kinks are optional but these are especially optional 

Extra Optional: water sports, scat, body hair, musk

Limits: gore, vore and vomit

Before you send a message I have a few questions for you (And please no Reddit chat, use PMs)

1. Who will you play?

2. How big should my cock be? (Between 8 inches and 5 feet)

3.

Dear amature witches. Be careful who you try put spells on this week.,"This girl keeps trying to stalk me and do evil things to me. I suspected her of being a witch but I didn't listen to my intuition back then.

I come from a long long bloodline of witches. I don't practice witchcraft but I have strong premonition, telepathy, intuition,and manifestation.

She tried to send me to prison on a bogus charge over a boy. She's white and thinks she's invincible. I also realized she tried to drown me in my car with my family months prior to me getting arrested. I'd have suicidal thoughts every full moon.

I fasted and when I was done fasting her boyfriend died.

She had been sending my negative energy and doing spells on me trying to get people to think I'm crazy and I sent that shot right back to her.

Not only that but I put a curse on everyone who tried to help her send me to prison and each and a lot of them ended up on the news and having horrible natural disasters happen in their city.

Stop thinking just because you dabble in the occult you know what you're doing. There are people who aren't witches but have stronger spiritual gifts. I'm a black widow. Everyone that hurts me badly ends up dead or having a messed up life unless they know how to protect themselves or close to me.

There are people with way stronger abilities than you out there. The whole time this girl was trying to do spells on me, there were warning signs for her to stop including her boyfriend's whole town being on fire with tornadoes. 

Now her whole town is in the process of being ruined too by natural disasters and pandemics.

Taskmaster is copying some Avenger moves,"In Black Widow, the title hero will deal with her past. For that, Marvel spy Natasha Romanoff has to compete against, among others, the mysterious combat artist Taskmaster. This villain has photographic reflexes with which he can copy the fighting skills of his opponents. And that makes him extremely dangerous.

Earlier today, Marvel launched the last big trailer for Black Widow. It includes a shot in which Taskmaster, whose true identity is kept secret, is studying the fighting style of Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson). For this, he uses surveillance images of Romanoff's famous fight from Iron Man 2 (2010).

But he has also clearly gained inspiration from the other Avengers. For example, he swings on a web à la Spider-Man and there are sharp claws in his suit that resemble those of Black Panther. In the series of gifs below we have listed the copy behavior of Taskmaster for you!

Who to fill in for Black Bolt on Inhumans?,"Ms. Marvel is the other inhuman, but there's no way I can advocate putting her on a team with no brawlers.

My favorite fit so far? Black Widow!

Many people have her homeless or on a fairly weak Avengers/hybrid/leftovers team.

But with inhumans, she has two Shield allies to speed up with Quake and Yoyo, and a chance to speed the rest. She still stealths (helps her survive since Crystal doesn't heal her), steals buffs, and stuns. Provides some nice utility and that old speed up/slow down combo with Quake.

[F4M] Housewife Avenger.,"Natasha was confused, she saw the man holding the reality stone which should have killed him but he was remarkably fine.

That man then locked eyes with her and grinned, snapping his fingers as she world dissapeared in a red light 

The Black Widow woke up confused and genuinely horrified, her body was different, sexier, fuller, and most importantly for the former avenger, she was weaker. 

The Widow got up and realized she was in a large ornate bedroom, wearing a sheer black lingerie set, a large diamond ring on her left hand along with perfectly manicured pink nails, she rolled out of bed and noted long blonde hair falling into her face and gasped as she looked down.

A new body, a sexy body with huge breasts a skinny waist, a thick round ass and child bearing hips.

She moved into the bathroom to look over herself and was floored, stunned, terrified, shaken. 

She had no muscle mass, all of her long time working in the gym was gone as she looked in horror at her new body, she looked soft, squishy and most importantly, vulnerable.

""Gotta get out of here..."" she said to herself looking for a phone, not hearing her new ""Husband"" get home. 

------

Hey all, so this is a rough outline of what's happened to the Black Widow, I'm thinking Nicolette Shea with Scarlett Johansson's face

As for kinks, humiliation(for this probably something about how she's weak and soft now), bimbofication obviously, some bondage, cum play

You can play rough or sweet but psychotic if you want, your call.

[F4M] Your Newest Slave Girl,"I had a good life once. Every day was peaceful and carefree, without a worry in the world. That all changed the day the slavers arrived, three weeks ago. They swarmed into my town, pillaging each building and taking everyone prisoner. No one managed to escape alive. Me, my family, and my friends were all suddenly thrust into the horrible world of slavery.  Each one of us was individually evaluated by the slavers' chief. Those deemed too weak to be beneficial, such as most of the elderly and sick, were executed. The strongest of the men were grouped together, as were the smallest of the children. One by one, we were all sorted out based on use. 

After hours of waiting, my evaluation finally came. One of the slavers came and collected me from my prison cell, dragging me away from my family. I didn't know it then, but I would never see them again. The slaver, a burly, hairy man, grabbed me by my long hair and clamped a heavy metal collar around my neck. Letting go of my dark locks, he pulled me by a leash into a small, brightly lit room. The man chained me to a post and released me. As he stepped away, another man entered - the slavers' chief. 

""All right, let's make this quick. Strip, now."" 

Tears welled up in my eyes as I shook my head violently. Sighing, the man pressed a button, and I felt a sharp shock course through my collar and into my body. 

""I said strip, slave. Don't make this harder than it has to be."" 

Whimpering, I shrugged off my dress, leaving only my underwear. Maybe, I thought, just maybe I can have *some* modesty. Another shock gives me my answer. 

""The undergarments too. Now!"" 

Reluctantly, I reached back and removed my bra, letting it fall to the floor and giving the man an eyeful of my perky tits. My panties join the bra on the floor, exposing my most intimate areas. The slave chief looks me up and down appraisingly, then steps closer. He touches my face, calculating, tracing his fingers down my neck. They make their way down to my breasts, which he feels and squeezes delicately, even stopping to tweak my sensitive nipples. Further down still they go, going over my mound and running back up along the curve of my ass. All the while, I whimper in helpless fear. 

The chief turned to his man, the one who brought me here. ""She'll do just fine as a pleasure slave. Put her with the others."" Nodding, the man took my naked body by the leash and led me out to a room filled with the other young women of my village. For a few weeks, we were all trapped in there, miserable. The pleasure slaves were fed only meager scraps, and forced to relieve themselves in a corner of the room. The smell grew unbearable fast. Finally, the day of the slave auction came - today. 

The others and I are led out to the market, already filled with potential buyers. The pleasure slave section in particular has amassed a large crowd. My wrists and ankles are latched into a metal frame, positioned to provide the best view and access for any customers. Quickly, a crowd of interested people gathers around me. My bare body is poked and prodded again and again, much to my discomfort. After what feels like hours of groping and abuse, a figure steps away from the others - my new buyer. 

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Hey there! So I'm looking for someone to roleplay as my cruel, perverse, and sadistic master. I'd love to incorporate noncon, humiliation, ENF, exhibitionism, forced stripping/stripteasing, groping, forced blowjobs/anal, buttplugs, rimming, beast/tentacle, watersports (receiving), maybe some body modification, and being forced to wear a leash and skimpy outfits/lingerie. 

My only hard limits are blood/gore, snuff, breeding, and futa. 

Below are some choices for where your story can go from here. I left the setting intentionally vague and ambiguous so that you have some freedom to choose that as well. With a few details changed, the roleplay could occur in medieval times, modern day, an apocalyptic future, or perhaps even a galaxy far, far away. The choice is yours. 

Option A: I am bought by a grotesque barbarian warlord, who parades me around as his trophy slave. I'm not his only slave girl, but I'm his favorite. Someday, he hopes, I will carry his heir. 

Option B: I am bought by a sleazy nightclub owner (this could be set in modern day or the future) to entertain his club's guests. This will entail me being a stripper or a waitress, forced to obey the demands of the club's customers (you could play the owner and/or the individual customers). Another variation on this: I play a celebrity in this same scenario, forced to work at a strip club/brothel made of other young, enslaved celebs.

***Option C:*** I am bought by a Hutt from the Star Wars universe, and used as his personal fucktoy. In versions of this roleplay that I've done before, the Hutt's tail basically functions as a tentacle/cock.

Option D: I am bought by a wealthy family as a maid, and forced to perform both real and sexual chores around their mansion.

Option E: I am an up-and-coming young actress, and you play my perverted agent/producer (think Harvey Weinstein). I'm pressured into serving as your sex slave for a weekend, reluctantly serving your every need. I really need this gig, no matter what it takes. For this, I could play as an actual celeb. Some celebs I'm interested in playing are Emma Watson, Alexandra Daddario, Emily Ratajkowski, Chloe Bennet, and Emilia Clarke. 

***Option F:*** Alternatively, maybe we could even combine all of those celebrities all in an underground brothel and club reserved for only the 1% of the 1%, the elites who run the world. There, celebrities are kidnapped and enslaved, forced to serve and pleasure wealthy businessmen however they desire. We could even bring more celebrities into the story here. You could play the club owner, and maybe some of the patrons too. I've got [a prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9p6d91/f4gm_welcome_to_club_aprico/?st=jq64g5tf&amp;sh=7d32cf1f) written up for this one specifically. 

Option G: More Rule 34! You pitch the characters and the scenario to me, as long as it has the same general theme as my prompt. Some worlds I'd like to explore include: 

* **Harry Potter** 

* Avatar: The Last Airbender/The Legend of Korra

* **Anything in the MCU (esp. Black Widow!)**

* Game of Thrones

* **Star Wars**

Option H: Invent your own buyer/concept! Just keep the situation generally detestable in tone please. 

(Bolded are my preferred choices for now)

If you're even slightly interested, shoot me a PM! We can work out the details and tailor the scene to fit both of our kinks and interests. In general, I might not be able to respond every day if you want to keep up the prompt long-term, but I'll always try to continue when I can. Please write more than a sentence for your reply – I want to hear your thoughts and ideas! 

**The more exciting, vivid, and creative you are, the better chance you have at getting a response :)**

**I will not respond to Reddit Chat messages.**",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgjoyb/f4m_your_newest_slave_girl/,,Salthook,fgjoyb,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgjoyb/f4m_your_newest_slave_girl/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgjoyb/f4m_your_newest_slave_girl/,0,2020-03-10

[M4F] - What’s your favorite TV Show?,"If this post is still up, I'm still looking.   18+ only

I'd love to set up a scene either with one (or More) characters from a show or movie. And really see if they're into the naughty things I've always imagined of them..

Or, their actress counterparts. Maybe a chance encounter with a fan. A filthy rendezvous with another Actor or crew member.  A contest, or an auction.

[Gloria](https://i.imgur.com/6T1u5FU.jpg) (Modern Family) So fucking amazingly hot. that accent, those curves, those fucking tits. You know she's nasty and freaky in bed. Willing to do anything to please the man she's with. She loves attention, and always knows that men are staring and drooling. She eats it up.

[Jackie](https://i.imgur.com/a7H40Qu.jpg) (That 70's Show) She's so spoiled. So sexy. So petite. Her parents paid for everything she wanted. But you know she had a few different Sugar Daddies on the side. And I bet she treats them extra special. And lets them do anything they want to her.

[Rachel](http://i.imgur.com/7SMEc.jpg) (Friends)  I mean, good lord. It must have been perpetually cold in that apartment. Her nipples were the real star of that show. Or maybe. She got a thrill knowing that people were looking. Maybe it got her a little wet if she caught one of her co-stars, or one of the crew looking at those perfect, perky tits.

[Sweet Dee](https://i.redd.it/7kdgxg8wxb9y.jpg) (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) ""Dee, you gangly, uncoordinated bitch!"" ""You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant make-up."" Sweet Dee gets shit on and fucked with so consistently, she's become completely self loathing and destructive. Now any time a guy even smiles at her she's ready to let him have all of her holes for as long as he wants, as rough as he wants. The dumb bitch.

If this is something that interests you, please send me a message. You could play as one or more of them, or just chat about them.

Kinks are: Anal/Assplay, rough fucking, choking/slapping/filthy name calling, MFF threesomes, tit fucking, age gaps, size difference, wet/sloppy blowjobs/deepthroat, drugs/drinking, cheating/getting caught.

Taskmaster in Civil War?,"Safe to say “Black Widow” will have it’s fair share of retconning. Throughout the trailers Taskmaster is seen copying Black Widow, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Panther, and Spider-Man. The only place they were all together fighting is the airport battle in “Civil War”. Maybe he was there hidden but watching? 

I know he could have just watched footage but it seems like too good an opportunity to pass up, especially since “Black Widow” takes place right after “Civil War”.",MCUTheories,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/fghaql/taskmaster_in_civil_war/,,saturdayseltzers,fghaql,/r/MCUTheories/comments/fghaql/taskmaster_in_civil_war/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/fghaql/taskmaster_in_civil_war/,2,2020-03-10

"HoX/PoX Update and it's size vs. Black Widow, New Mutants and 5th Anniversary: Which will be April's Update?","I know it's **super early** to tell, but today I was thinking about next update (and I'm SO hyped for HoX/PoX, that was the one theme I was waiting for an update, I hope they do it right) and how big it could be, knowing that April is right around the corner.  
For those who are not reading HoX/PoX - Dawn of X comics, Jonathan Hickman is literally changing the WHOLE mutantkind mythology (&gt;!All mutant heroes and villains living together in an island/sovereign state, Krakoa; all mutants are capable of ressurecting; they discover mutantkind is not the higher end of human evolution; Omega level mutants are now canon!&lt;), and we are yet to see it's changes in the Marvel Universe, but they are certain to happen (&gt;!Fantastic Four/X-Men is proof of that, as Reed is studying the source of all power in the universe to understand Franklin's, as Xavier tries to talk to him into living in Krakoa and learning how to be a mutant!&lt;)

That said, my fear is that HoX/PoX update wouldn't be as big as Warriors of the Sky was (urgh), when it certainly should be to cover properly all the changes Hickman and his team are doing to mutants. But it might have a reason.

There's 3 Marvel events happening now in April: The New Mutants movie release (April 3rd), Black Widow's movie release (April 24th), and Marvel Future Fight 5th Anniversary (April 30th). Which leads me to 3 questions:  
\- Is HoX/PoX update going to be small because of the next one? Or big as it should be?  
\- What is going to be April's update theme, since it's also anniversary month? The three combined?  
\- Which theme would you guys prefer for April? New Mutants, Black Widow or something different?

&amp;#x200B;

If I'd chose, this next update would be a BIG one, with significant changes to mutants in-game (yes, more ways to get X-gene for free and more free mutants; maybe an Epic Quest; maybe a new Giant Boss), and a part 2 between March and April with New Mutants content. That would leave the end of april for Black Widow and the Anniversary.

Last but not least, if you are/were an X-Men fan, **read House of X/Powers of X - Dawn of X**. It changes everything for the best, and it's awesome to see mutants having some focus and status in Marvel again. It is really promising.

[M4F] Black Widow or Scarlet Witch (Longterm &amp; Detailed),"I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+

Hi! I’m looking for literate and detailed partners, that can commit to something long-term. I’m looking to do something based on the MCU, and you’ll play as Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, or you can run a suggestion by me. 

I’d prefer if we figured out the details together, but I’d like to do something along these lines: I’m a new recruit that is now your responsibility to train. As we work with each other we both start to get a bit of a crush the other, and things take off from there. 

My kinks are rough sex, passionate sex, handjobs, titfucks, footjobs, spanking, hair pulling, deepthroating, sloppy blowjobs, etc. 

My limits are piss, scat, gore, vore, vomit, futa, fisting, sounding, inflation, etc.

I write in first and usually write two paragraphs. I’m only looking for partners that can commit to something long-term, and can put some detail into their responses. If that sounds like you then send me a message!

If you’re interested message me on kik @ xN8IVx, and please include your kinks and limits in the first message. 

Thanks for your interest!",Roleplaykik,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/fgk8av/m4f_black_widow_or_scarlet_witch_longterm_detailed/,PARTNER SEARCH,muhfknRP,fgk8av,/r/Roleplaykik/comments/fgk8av/m4f_black_widow_or_scarlet_witch_longterm_detailed/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplaykik/comments/fgk8av/m4f_black_widow_or_scarlet_witch_longterm_detailed/,1,2020-03-10

"[A4A] [3rd] [Discord] Zelda, Star Wars, Marvel, oh my!","Hi! The name's Polyblium, but Poly will do just fine (and is a bit easier to say). I'm 19 and I live in the United States, specifically the CST timezone. I've been writing RP for many years, to the point that I've become comfortable with stepping into a character's shoes and getting into their mindframe. I've also been a DM for a D&amp;D group for a good year and a half which I've come to love, as it has greatly improved my descriptive skills.

I have a love for many fandoms, mostly due to being a bit of a nerd since childhood. So I decided to throw all the fandoms I like in here for the sake of simplicity. Here is the long list of things I'm interested in writing (the number of exclamation marks is how bad I wanna do it).

* Zelda [!!!!!] (Specifically Breath of the Wild. Zelda/Link is the only relationship I'll RP here.)

* Star Wars [!!!] (I just finished Clone Wars and loved it. The release of Season 7 has me very excited! I'd prefer to RP during that era, either with OCs or established characters. If the latter, including Ahsoka would be nice.)

* Marvel [!] (Specifically MCU. The new trailer for Black Widow has me excited. I'd love to do a Steve/Natasha thing, or an RP that expands on an unexplored part of the universe.)

* The Witcher (I am more well versed with the games than the show or books, but this is another RP where I am fine with either doing established characters or OCs)

* Persona (The fifth game is my favorite, and my preferred pairing is Joker/Ann. Makoto is overrated. I also like Yu/Rise from 4)

Finally, more general stuff:

* Cyberpunk (Really excited for Cyberpunk 2077, so I'm always eager to do something that shamelessly leans into this genre's conventions)

* Fantasy (Think D&amp;D. In this one, I'd probably adopt more of a GM role, and set the RP in the world I play in my home game)

* Noir (I love hardboiled detective stories, like The Maltese Falcon. Like cyberpunk, I'd like to lean into the tropes pretty hard with this one, but subversion is always nice too)

* Sci-Fi (Think something like Alien -- old, bulky, functional tech rather than anything sleek. Could be an exploration RP, or we could take inspiration from Alien itself and make it a bit more horrific)

That's about all I got. Many of these I left open so that we can brainstorm ideas together. I don't have any kind of post length requirement, so long as you're able to type good English. Additionally, NSFW is possible for all of these, but don't come to me expecting constant smut. That's not what I enjoy.

Finally I just have to add that I prefer M/F pairings, I don't really enjoy RPing any others, so please keep that in mind before you DM me. When you do message me, just give me your discord username and tell me which RP(s) you're interested in.

Thanks in advance!",Roleplay,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/fgg5y8/a4a_3rd_discord_zelda_star_wars_marvel_oh_my/,,polyblium,fgg5y8,/r/Roleplay/comments/fgg5y8/a4a_3rd_discord_zelda_star_wars_marvel_oh_my/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/fgg5y8/a4a_3rd_discord_zelda_star_wars_marvel_oh_my/,6,2020-03-10

[F4M] Driving the widow wild,"So you've probably read the title and thought ""What the fuck? How's anyone gonna find the death of a loved one arousing?"" and that's a fair question. Funerals are probably not the most sexy of events but i'm gonna see if i can make it work, and if you decided to click on this then you're probably adventurous enough to give it a shot.

Now obviously a funeral is an emotional time for everyone involved but when a poor fella finally pops his clogs nobody is more distraught than his wife. However extreme sadness isn't actually that far away from extreme lust and sometimes the only way to deal with trauma is to listen to Peaches and ""Fuck the Pain Away"".

You could be practically anyone from my dearly departed husband's closest friend or family member all the way to a random guy that decides to gatecrash a funeral (is that something people actually do?). You could potentially be sweet and comforting, with passion slowly developing between us as i mourn for my husband. Or you could be the exact opposite, you could be a lewd pervert who doesn't care that my husband just died and wants to tell me how good my tits look in my black mourning dress or just let me know that my husband's not the only thing that's stiff at this funeral.

There's a lot of wriggle room here, i just know i want a weird, taboo hookup between an attractive widow and any man that could bring her some kind of physical or emotional relief in her time of need.

Kink wise i'm fairly normal (at least by this subs standards). I like dirty talk, oral sex, PIV, anal, Mdom/Fsub and Fdom/Msub. I don't mind things dark and rough but also like sweet and romantic or even just purely lustful passion.

I'm really not sure about my limits so far. I don't want to say no anything without at least trying it but you're probably going to need to warm me up to being raped and murdered or something like that.

I'd like this to be somewhat detailed (so no chat messages please), maybe a paragraph or two per response. Please don't send me really short, pointless messages that give me no indication of who you are or what you want but also don't immediately start roleplaying, i want to talk things over a bit first.

Hope to see you soon!",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgk4wt/f4m_driving_the_widow_wild/,RP,qveeny,fgk4wt,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgk4wt/f4m_driving_the_widow_wild/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgk4wt/f4m_driving_the_widow_wild/,0,2020-03-10
[Spoiler] Black Widow solo film,"We all know that Natasha died in endgame, just as we all know that comic book characters don't stay dead.

After the comics event Secret Empire, natasha is dead. But the Red Room refuses to lose an asset, so clones Natasha complete with her memories. Big mistake!! As Natasha obviously tears shit up.

My theory is that MCU Natasha finds the cloning facility in the Red Room and destroys it. However during a post credit scene, its revealed not all her clones were destroyed. This leads into future appearances by ScarJo. Kinda a copout I know, but come on this is a Marvel film.

P.S. I also think one of her allies in the film dies or betrays Natasha or both, being a typical spy film and all.",FanTheories,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/fg9vaz/spoiler_black_widow_solo_film/,FanSpeculation,Metrilean,fg9vaz,/r/FanTheories/comments/fg9vaz/spoiler_black_widow_solo_film/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/fg9vaz/spoiler_black_widow_solo_film/,2,2020-03-10

"F4A(playing F) The Black Widow, My Loving Protector."," Hello everyone. I posted this prompt before with some plot to it and it was a dud. Granted the theme of it was a bit out there but I think it's worth it to try one more time. In the is story, I want you to play as the deadly Black Widow, Natasha Romanov, Shield's deadliest agent but with a slight twist. Hidden from any records and for when you go off the radar for R and R, you decide to have a little house in a small suburb far from the prying eye. In this small house is me. Now let me tell you something for the people who didnt see my earlier prompt. I want my character to have some disabilities. Like the big one is that id love to be wheelchair bound but I dont want this to always be a thing. Maybe we can have an arc where I go to therapy and in able to walk with help of a walker or cane. Id also like it if I just cant keep up with you in the bedroom to cement my inferiority to you. Now these disabilities are not a deal breaker but I would really love to play with these.

[M4F] Black Widow or Scarlet Witch (Longterm &amp; Detailed),"I am 18+ and all participants and characters must be 18+

Hi! I’m looking for literate and detailed partners, that can commit to something long-term. I’m looking to do something based on the MCU, and you’ll play as Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, or you can run a suggestion by me. 

I’d prefer if we figured out the details together, but I’d like to do something along these lines: I’m a new recruit that is now your responsibility to train. As we work with each other we both start to get a bit of a crush the other, and things take off from there. 

My kinks are rough sex, passionate sex, handjobs, titfucks, footjobs, spanking, hair pulling, deepthroating, sloppy blowjobs, etc. 

My limits are piss, scat, gore, vore, vomit, futa, fisting, sounding, inflation, etc.

I write in first and usually write two paragraphs. I’m only looking for partners that can commit to something long-term, and can put some detail into their responses. If that sounds like you then send me a message!

If you’re interested message me on kik @ xN8IVx, and please include your kinks and limits in the first message.

Taskmaster has the potential to be one of the best villains in the MCU.,He’s already a badass in the comics. He looks absolutely amazing in Black Widow. I didn’t like his mask at first but it’s kinda growing on me. I really hope Taskmaster isn’t a one and done villain. I can see him being in many other MCU movies in the future.

Black Widow Movie Theory Taskmaster is Black Widow's Father,"The Identity of Taskmaster is seen as a mystery in the Black Widow Movie because the actor hasn't been revealed.Some say he might be Tony Masters,Hawkeye,Yelena Belova or someone we never met before,I think it's latter, I think Taskmaster might  be the father of Black Widow.

In endgame Red Skull said ""Natasha Romanoff, Daughter of Ivan"" and She said she never met her father. So people made theories that It might Ivan Vanko but some don't agree with theory and I don't either so I think this is a different Ivan.

In the comics the named Ivan used for a character named Ivan Petrovich Bezukhov,Ivan Petrovich Bezukhov was Natasha's foster father before bringing her to the Red Room Academy and then he return as a cyborg.

But I think this Ivan is gonna be a far cry from the one in the comics and the Ivan Vanko version

This What I think is the origin of taskmaster,He was a man named Ivan who married and had a kid but he was also a criminal and he wad drafted by A.I.M. First he had to inflitrate Wakanda and steal to Repulicate Captain America's shield and he stole Hawkeye's Bow and Arrows and A.I.M. made enhanced version

In the deleted scene from Captain America Civil War Natasha said she found her graves.So I think Nat's mom remarried and her and new husband were murdered by Ivan and then her uncle and Aunt took her an orphanage.

In 1994  Romanoff was recruited by the KGB. At a Red Room Academy, she endured both an education and indoctrination into the world of spy-craft.  Eventually, Clint Barton is sent to kill Romanoff, but instead chooses to spare her life and recruit her to S.H.I.E.L.D., enabling Romanoff to escape her previous life as an assassin. That's when the spy Black Widow was Born

Ivan dug deep in the Avengers' fighting styles and Moves  and in order to copy them A.I.M downloaded  Iron man's schematic for the Mark 46 because that can analyze someone's fight pattern and used  the same heads up display for his eyepiece and they attached  a camera lens.

He also study Black widow's moves  from the surveillance footage from Iron Man 2 and He study spider-man's swinging moves from those Youtube videos and that's when Ivan became the villian known as Taskmaster.

Here's how Taskmaster took controlled of the Red Room,I think he killed the original owner and manipulated the members.

So I think in the last trailer when Taskmaster fought Black Widow this could be the part where he reveals his true Identity and He tells her sher's father if this theory's true.

So what do you think of this theory tell in comments below.",FanTheories,2,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/fh6u65/black_widow_movie_theory_taskmaster_is_black/,Marvel,Starkstar502,fh6u65,/r/FanTheories/comments/fh6u65/black_widow_movie_theory_taskmaster_is_black/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/fh6u65/black_widow_movie_theory_taskmaster_is_black/,14,2020-03-11

Spare me your puns in your headers, your elaborate, long explanations of lore like this is some kind of Tolkeinian epic, your nuanced, detailed descriptions. You'll get none of that in this prompt. What I want is simple: I want you to play DC Comic's own [Power Girl,](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/98ddc9db-23d4-4913-b88c-212e2aacf7ff/d1mwchp-c4c4aa83-9cfd-4d98-96c4-929178dc2c73.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7InBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzk4ZGRjOWRiLTIzZDQtNDkxMy1iODhjLTIxMmUyYWFjZjdmZlwvZDFtd2NocC1jNGM0YWE4My05Y2ZkLTRkOTgtOTZjNC05MjkxNzhkYzJjNzMuanBnIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmZpbGUuZG93bmxvYWQiXX0.hIJL3ey7uVchp-ghplJqsupT2a-ny-RE6d2HqA1Q6Iw) who in the course of this roleplay I will meet and have sex with, with the possibility of it being either a one time fling or a long term scene, depending on if we get along or not.

You may find me shallow for writing something like this. And I will not lie: I am shallow. I'm a puddle when it comes to this particular idea. But can you really blame me? I mean, just look at her! She's practically a [goddess!] (https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0949/2324/products/Power_Girl_Portrait_Color_web_1024x1024.jpg?v=1462575605) To be honest, I find her way more attractive then Wonder Woman. No offense to The Most Famous Female Superhero (Black Widow and Captain Marvel aren't even close, let's not even pretend) but PG seems more...I don't know...FUN then WW. Wonder Woman is a princess and all that, which means that she's formal, while Power Girl you could actually imagine picking up a cute guy that she saves.

[F4M] Romantic Harems - Rule 34 and Original,"I am an adult looking for another adult for a fantasy roleplay. All characters must be 18+.

Been in the mood for some harems lately, so I’m gonna bump this. :p

Hey there! I decided to write out some harem prompts here for you guys - since a lot of my longer term RPs have gone that direction anyway, I may as well present the ideas up front to you guys.

These plans mainly focus on the romance, almost like a dating sim in a way - but of course, I’d like to make it so some characters put out sooner than others based on their personality.

Also, if you’re a female reading this, feel free to reuse some of these prompts in your own posts.

Just some ground rules beforehand to temper expectations. These are things you should NOT do when messaging me, or else I may ignore you.

* Do NOT message me assuming I play RPs on Reddit. I only play on Discord and sometimes Kik.
* Do NOT send me a one-sentence introduction. There’s plenty of others who make interesting and wonderful intros, so I’d rather give them the time for taking the time to present themselves well.
* Do NOT send me your own prompts unless they’re similar to my own.
* Do NOT send me a sample of your work. You don’t need to impress me. This does the exact opposite, and just intimidates me instead.

The prompts are all below - and are based somewhat upon prompts I’ve posted previously!

**\[Slice of Life\]**

**School:** This school year, you’ve been blessed with the opportunity to have plenty of beautiful teachers in your classes that you can’t keep your eyes off. Some younger, some older - some in between. You still want them all. Can play students too for this one if you’d rather play as a teacher - or if you just want some classmates as romantic interests as well. I do like playing older, though, so the teachers are fun.

**Extended Family:** I’m not huge into incest, not that I dislike it in RPs, but I’ve grown kinda bored of the standard mother/son or father/daughter thing. Instead, I’d love to play out some kind of scenario involving your character’s aunts (can be multiple) and cousins. How many there are is up to you, but I’d find it WAY more interesting than the dull incest scenarios I’m used to.

**Neighborhood:** As an 18 or 19 year old, moving in on your own into an unfamiliar neighborhood was something you were worried about. Whether you got your home from inheritance, on your own dime, or even if it’s a solo dorm room - you hadn’t expected a neighborhood with such beautiful women about. This is a bit more open and involves a lot of normal occupations having romantic interests - like the waitress at the local cafe, the police woman always stationed at the same spot, or even a visiting celebrity passing through town.

**\[Fantasy/Medieval\]**

**The Prince:** You’ve become King of a kingdom at a young age, but now you want to travel to other countries to strengthen your rule due to skepticism among your populace about your youthful leadership. What that entails is a trek across the globe to bed queens and high ranking officials wherever possible!

* Alternatively, this can be done in a modern setting with a rich guy, or some other descendant of royalty.

**\[Supernatural\]**

**Halloween Night:** Sure, you’re a little old to be Trick-or-Treating, but that didn’t stop you. It’s free candy, right? Little did you know, your neighborhood was filled with women that were captivating to the eye, and they were all dressed up for the occasion. You aren’t complaining, but why is the clock frozen? Why is Halloween night going for what seems like forever? I think this could be fun to play out using some cosplay references too if you’d like.

* Alternatively, this can be a never-ending neighborhood Halloween party - or a trek into a supernatural forest on Halloween night!

**Time Travel:** Marty McFly met his young mother in Back to the Future, and you may be doing the same! What if you did have a time traveling device though? Wouldn’t you use to visit some of your ancestors and see what they’re like? I think this could be a ton of fun, jumping through different eras and has the potential for some drama/action too if you’d like - depending on the era you jump to!

**\[Cosplay\]**

**Disney:** DIsney owns a lot of properties now, don’t they? Star Wars, Marvel, and of course their own original princesses. So there are a lot of cosplayers wandering about Disney World that catch your eye. I’d love to play out a scenario where you are able to have some of them to yourself.

**Convention:** You’re a lucky young guy who got to go to a convention on his own. Of course, there’s plenty of ladies walking about clad in the cosplays they picked out for the occasion. We can say for convenience that this con goes on for a week or so, but it can possibly extend after the con into other conventions - or perhaps the cosplayers you met just so happen to live close by?

* Alternatively, if you want - the girls at this convention can be a little *too* good at their jobs, and **are** the actual characters they're portraying.

**\[Rule 34\]**

**Crossover-Castle:** A castle in some dimension unknown is where you’ve been transported to, seemingly overnight. The castle is a huge and expansive building with tons of rooms - but no way out. Not only that, but it was filled with only women - all of which you were familiar with, and were shocked to see in person!

**IRL Replaced:** Overnight for some possible reason, your neighborhood has been replaced with some of your favorite fictional ladies. Everyone. Your teachers, your doctor, that lady who lives across the street… even your own mother, if you’re into that. How will you go about things in life with all these fictional characters around you now?

**Androids:** It’s the future, and you run a company that creates Androids based on the likenesses of popular fictional females before sending them out to serve specific purposes in the world. They are indistinguishable from normal humans in every way, even down to their emotions. It does hurt your heart when you have to send them off though. I’m sure your boss wouldn’t mind if you kept a few replicas around..

**Fractured World:** Just like the Castle prompt, you’ve been transported to a different dimension. Except, this one is much more familiar… and has splintered locations from worlds you’re aware of. Sure, you may be in Megaton (Fallout) at the moment, but walk out those gates and you may find yourself in the middle of a grassy Route (Pokemon). Don’t worry, though -  a little walk to the west and you’ll find yourself in Armadillo (Red Dead).You’re not the only one misplaced, though - other characters are too, and you’ll find them in places you don’t expect.

**\[Specific Rule 34\]**

I have some specific prompts for Rule 34 universes that are not crossovers like above, so I’ve made a different section for them. These prompts are also on my Rule 34 list which you can find below.

**Marvel:** You're a young vigilante who's been saving people around his town Defenders-style during the aftermath of Infinity War. Black Widow shows up to make a case file on you. We can play it out longterm, with you meeting a bunch of Marvel girls along the way. Obviously, not everyone is alive during this period, so the events of Endgame have to come into play. We can talk about what that entails if we get to that point. Or we can include plenty of Marvel gals that are not in the MCU - like Emma Frost, Elsa Bloodstone, Psylocke, Elektra (she's in Daredevil so technically MCU - but not the movies, so ya know), etc.

**Overwatch:** You're a new recruit to Overwatch, and reluctantly, you're allowed to stay at Watchpoint: Gibraltar, since they're in desperate need for new members. Although starting with just Mercy and Tracer, you'll build your harem over time by going on recruiting missions - while also encountering Talon girls along the way.

**Pokemon:** The Pokemon World Tournament invited you over and you're the young man who's going to have some sweet romance and smut with most of the human PokeGirls attending. Champions like Cynthia, Leaders like Skyla, Elite Four members like Olivia, even other Trainers like Rosa. Alternatively, we could do an adventure that is through a region of your choice. All major male characters have been swapped out for female equivalents. All of these characters will be aged up to 18+ where appropriate. This is non-negotiable.

And that’s all for now! I’ll probably add more in the future, but that’s what I have in mind for now.

If you have any variations of these ideas or changes you want to make, let me know and I’ll see if I like the idea you have.

You can find my list of Rule 34 girls on my profile. There's a link in my previous posts. Posting this gave me trouble, so I'm trying to lessen the amount of links... ask me to send you a link if you wanna see the list.

Some other things to keep in mind:

* Please don’t hesitate to ask if I know a certain character or franchise. I try to play characters I know so I can get into their persona for you. If I’ve seen their design before, I can attempt it.
* I use IRL references when it comes to non-R34 RPs. So hopefully that’s comfortable for you! All 18+ of course.
* All Rule 34 characters will be aged up to 18, per the subreddit’s rules. This is non-negotiable.
* I do NOT play on Reddit. Kik is slow as hell nowadays, so I’ll only use it if there’s nothing else. My preferred platform is Discord. I do like setting things up on Reddit before switching over from time to time though.
* I love playing older, preferably if my partner is young. Anywhere from 18-20.
* Please, please. I cannot express this enough. I am so sick and tired of getting character descriptions of characters that involve someone tall, handsome, and athletic with a big cock. I’m fucking tired of those characters, and I may even tell you to change it or leave me be if you send me that because I’m honestly just done with those type of characters. Be a little more creative, please? I’m not saying you have to play a fat slob, but not every guy is a instagram model for fuck’s sake.

Sorry if I ranted a bit there.

Also, I have a ton of limits. Sorry. If some of these are dealbreakers for you, I apologize: [https://i.imgur.com/Gfwntxy.png](https://i.imgur.com/Gfwntxy.png)

Please also feel free to ask if I know or want to do a specific kink you’re looking for.

And… that’s it! I hope to see some good messages from you all!",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgo896/f4m_romantic_harems_rule_34_and_original/,,Throwaway228788,fgo896,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgo896/f4m_romantic_harems_rule_34_and_original/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgo896/f4m_romantic_harems_rule_34_and_original/,0,2020-03-11

My hope for Black Widow's soundtrack,"... is that we get some good Russian rock/pop singles. 

I can't speak for other people, but almost every song in my music library has some memory attached to it. It might be from my childhood, seeing an artist in a show, or was playing when sharing a moment with someone at a bar. Personally, I can't just listen to someone else's (or algorithmically generated) playlist and find music I will like. So naturally, movies I enjoy are a great source for music discovery for me. 

Living in an English-sprawling country tends to limit my exposure to new music from mostly American, Canadian, British, and Australian artists. While Marvel for a good while stuck with their own orchestral music, since Guardians they've been expanding more their soundtracks in other films, I hope they continue that with Black Widow.

Black Widow,"I recently participated in a black widow test session, I will say a few things about the film: For those who want to know, TaskMaster is a man, I can only say that. The big twist of the film is not about the identity of the TaskMaster, but about Yelena and Natasha and will certainly leave many fans with anger and doubts. In my session there was a post-credit scene, which takes place today and you will be surprised. There is no participation of Robert Downey Jr, not even in flashbacks, as for Jeremy Renner, he appears briefly in a fight scene in a flashback. There is only one major death in the film, and as for the TaskMaster, yes, it survives the events of the film. I really liked the movie, I think it's better than Captain Marvel, my grade would be 7.5 / 10.",MarvelStudiosSpoilers,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/fgqapc/black_widow/,,Western-Addition,fgqapc,/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/fgqapc/black_widow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/fgqapc/black_widow/,16,2020-03-11

No offense to The Most Famous Female Superhero (Black Widow and Captain Marvel aren't even close, let's not even pretend) but PG seems more...I don't know...FUN then WW.

I’d prefer if we figured out the details together, but I’d like to do something along these lines: I’m a new recruit that is now your responsibility to train. As we work with each other we both start to get a bit of a crush the other, and things take off from there.

My limits are piss, scat, gore, vore, vomit, futa, fisting, sounding, inflation, etc.

I write in first and usually write two paragraphs. I’m only looking for partners that can commit to something long-term, and can put some detail into their responses. If that sounds like you then send me a message!

27M4F black widow and spiderman,"







All character 18+

It had been two weeks since the airport fight in Germany, and Peter found himself wracked with guilt and uncertainty over what he saw.  He remembered watching Captain America and that guy with the weird arm running towards the hangar, and heading there to stop them. He had crawled up to the top of the hangar in order to get the drop on them, and then that is where his memory gets less certain. 

What was confusing him, was that he thought he had seen Black Widow actually attack the guy in the cat suit and letting Cap go!  He knew he had to be wrong though, Black Widow was one of the good guys, why would she let them escape? And if she did let them escape, did that mean he had to go tell Mr.Stark what he had seen? 

He knew what the right thing to do was, but he was unsure of what he had seen, maybe something else was going on, or maybe she was just letting them go so she could follow them and catch them off guard at a later time.  But what if she actually was a traitor? Mr.Stark would have to be told. 

What Peter didn't know, was that Natasha had seen him that day, and she knew that he saw her.  She had spent the past couple weeks tracking him down, which wasn't easy, since Tony was so careful to protect his identity, but she had finally found him, and now she was going to have to do whatever it took to make sure he stayed quiet. 

So that's the prompt that has been kicking around in my head for a while.  Basically, Black Widow decides that she'll have to seduce Spiderman in order to make sure he doesn't tell Iron Man about letting Cap and Bucky go. 

My kinks include doggy style, creampies, huge facials, big cocks, anal, sloppy oral, spanking, hair pulling, choking, face sitting, and dirty talk.  My limits are bathroom stuff, beast, and underage.",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fh1z2l/27m4f_black_widow_and_spiderman/,,Dppthrowaway27m,fh1z2l,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fh1z2l/27m4f_black_widow_and_spiderman/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fh1z2l/27m4f_black_widow_and_spiderman/,0,2020-03-11

"If Black Widow &amp; F9 are Delayed due to COVID-19, here's how I think things will play out...","I'm hoping things will get better soon, but let's assume major March releases flop like Quiet Place 2 and Mulan. Films in June will most likely be safe, but major May releases will be at risk. Namely Black Widow and F9. In the case that these two films get moved, here's where I think they will go and the domino effect that will result from their moving: 

* **Black Widow** moves to Friday, **JULY 3rd**. 
* **F9** moves to Friday, **AUGUST 7th**.

Now for what I think will move as a result of this:

* **SCOOB!** will move up a week to Friday, **MAY 8th** to give it more breathing room from Spongebob. 
* **Artemis Fowl** will move up and take BW's Friday, **MAY 1st** release date. Disney must know this movie is going to flop. By moving it to the May 1st date it has the chance to do well in that prime spot assuming the virus isn't as severe in early May. This is a film that is doomed regardless so they can take this risk that they couldn't take with BW. 
* **Free Guy** will move from July 3rd to Artemis Fowl's old date of Friday, **MAY 29TH**. Again, hopefully the virus will die down at this point and it isn't a bad spot for the movie to take with BW having its old date and Artemis Fowl moving up. 
* **Minions: Rise of Gru** will move up to Wednesday, **JULY 1st**. This will give it just a little bit of space from BW, though not much. It's not an ideal situation for both films, but I don't believe Universal will move Minions much farther. 

The next few moves have less to do with BW &amp; F9 moving, but more to do with the fact that No Time to Die moved back to November:

* **Godzilla Vs. Kong** will move up to Summer and release on Wednesday, **AUGUST 19th**. Being sandwiched between Eternals and No Time to Die would be a death sentence for this film. Though the new date I propose would be very late in the Summer, I feel like it would still work out better for its box office. It gives it a little bit of breathing room from F9's new date and it can really market itself as the last biggie of the Summer. 
* Being another Warner Bros. film, I feel that they may move James Wan's **Malignant** back from August 14th to Wednesday, **NOVEMBER 25th**. Last Thanksgiving Knives Out did very well, so Malignant may do well in this date too. And I feel that Warner Bros. wouldn't want it to release only 5 days before Godzilla vs. Kong, so moving it is their only option in this scenario. 
* Lastly with Godzilla vs. Kong gone, I feel that **No Time to Die** will move up and take the Friday, **NOVEMBER 20th** release date. 

This is all just my speculation. Hopefully the virus hysteria will subside and none of these movies move. But with the situation in the US and Europe continuing to worsen and the May spots looking more precarious, I had to make sense of it all and predict how the release schedule might change. Regardless, one thing's for sure... This may be the weakest May box office in recent memory. 

But this is all secondary.

Any chance of a White Widow style?,"

I always thought the characters they chose for the Endgame Marvel skins were sort of strange. Starlord makes enough sense, but Black Widow is hardly many fans favorite hero. I mean, it’s no argument that Cap or Tony or Thor all certainly would have sold better. So I always figured the decision was made based on the fact that those characters could be re-released again at a later date — what with Black Widow already in the pipeline and more Guardians to come eventually. 

All that being said, if Black Widow is set to hit the shop once more, do we think she gets a White Widow style from the new film? 

(a capable artist might insert here a concept of what that might look like, but alas I am not he.) 

Imagine it though... she’d look awesome 🕷❄️",FortNiteBR,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fgqwkd/any_chance_of_a_white_widow_style/,DISCUSSION,QuicklyCat,fgqwkd,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fgqwkd/any_chance_of_a_white_widow_style/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/fgqwkd/any_chance_of_a_white_widow_style/,13,2020-03-11
The Grandmaster (MCU) throws River Tam (Serenity) into a gauntlet of random action heroes. How far does she make it?,"Let me explain further:

River is thrown into the Grandmaster's arena with the (false) promise she will be let go if she can beat everything the Grandmaster has to offer, including his champion. She gets no rest time after each fight, all of which will be hand to hand only and won by KO. Also, not every round will be 1v1.

Note: The power levels here might be a bit off in terms of order, so I apologize for that in advance. Definitely don't have to list all of the rounds of you don't want to.

* Round 1: Nathan Drake (Uncharted) and Lara Croft (Reboot)
* Round 2: Oliver Queen (CW show, season 5)
* Round 3: Chris Redfield and Sheva (RE 5)
* Round 4: The Punisher (MCU)
* Round 5: Beatrix Kiddo (The Bride)
* Round 6: Daredevil (MCU)
* Round 7: John Wick (dog-lusted)
* Round 8: Melinda May and Black Widow (MCU)
* Round 9: Ahsoka Tano (Rebels)
* Round 10: The Grandmaster's champion: Jetstream Sam (MGS)

Bonus round: After/if River beats all rounds, The Grandmaster is so entertained by her performance he wants her as his new champion, and refuses to let her go. Can River break out and successfully kill the Grandmaster to secure her freedom? She can use whatever equipment she can get her hands on.",whowouldwin,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/fh5lb1/the_grandmaster_mcu_throws_river_tam_serenity/,Battle,Noahop5000,fh5lb1,/r/whowouldwin/comments/fh5lb1/the_grandmaster_mcu_throws_river_tam_serenity/,https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/fh5lb1/the_grandmaster_mcu_throws_river_tam_serenity/,9,2020-03-11
How to save Black Widow without messing anything up (Spoilers for Endgame),"So, immediately after watching the movie I thought of a way to rescue Black Widow.

I made my Reddit account just for this in fact.

So, at the end of Endgame, Cap has to return all the stones.

Including the soul stone. Now, the idea is he'll return the stone and hammer immediately after they were taken.

For eg. as soon as Hulk disappeared with Time Stone, Cap would appear and give Ancient One the stone.

Now, for soul stone, there is a special condition: sacrifice.

What if, instead of going there after Clint left, Cap goes there when Clint and Natasha were fighting.

He explains to them the situation and says: I already have the Soul Stone. So, nobody needs to be sacrificed. He gives Clint the stone, and takes Natasha back with him. To prevent the timeline from branching, he also asks Clint, makes him swear on his dead family, uses the mind stone or whatever so that Clint keeps it a secret, and lies to everyone about Natasha dying. There it is, Cap takes Natasha back to the present time, all the stones are returned and everyone lived happily ever after.",MCUTheories,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/fgz3sw/how_to_save_black_widow_without_messing_anything/,,Erik_Keehl,fgz3sw,/r/MCUTheories/comments/fgz3sw/how_to_save_black_widow_without_messing_anything/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/fgz3sw/how_to_save_black_widow_without_messing_anything/,10,2020-03-11

I would sell Disney stock if I had any,"After putting all their eggs in the 2019 basket, all expected a down year for Disney. It's not surprise that it's ringing true so far. However, other studios came out the gate stronger than usual and there's a widely held sentiment that Disney will eventually be the #1 studio in 2020 in terms of boxoffice revenue. But are we *sure* Disney will win the year with Eternals, Soul, Artemis Fowl, Mulan, and Black Widow (and the untitled November animated release)? Can't speak for international but domestically, it's not guaranteed they'll beat Sony / Warner Brothers with that lineup.

Also, even if the COVID-19 outbreak plateaus in the next few weeks, their theme parks will feel the aftershocks for months, and see depressed attendance.

Right now Disney+ is still more of a cost center due to the upfront costs. And besides Baby Yoda, there isn't much beyond their legacy product. ESPN is still dragging earnings.

Right now their businesses are very much exposed to anything that limits going outside and they're not the unassailable behemoth that I grew accustomed to thinking of them as.",movies,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fgsyal/i_would_sell_disney_stock_if_i_had_any/,,RogerSmith123456,fgsyal,/r/movies/comments/fgsyal/i_would_sell_disney_stock_if_i_had_any/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fgsyal/i_would_sell_disney_stock_if_i_had_any/,16,2020-03-11

30M4F- SuperMEGA-Nerdgasm,"Like playing with nerds or just nerdy themes or based on more nerdy movies, shows or games? look no further.


Look below for a number of potential starting points to build from, combine, or just to get an idea of how I think? I am always up to brainstorm and build new ideas:



* **Nerd's Lucky Day** - Your standard nerd fantasy of a nerd drawing the attention of a much hotter girl or woman, as playing out some age differences can be fun too, could be anything from the girl next door, one of his mother's friends, a coworker, college roommate, even a random encounter at the mall.


* **Nerd's Dark Day** - On the other hand the nerd is tired of being ignored, bullied, and laughed at and now moves to get what he always wanted, searching out for a girl who is out of his league and forcing her to please him, as it can be strictly forced, blackmail, drugging, or something involving some science/ nerd tech he builds to control her mind or body to obey him.


* **A Nerd's Ultimate Fantasy** - A nerd creating a device that lets him play with some of his favorite characters from Movies, TV Shows, and Games.


* **Virtual Reality** - Not the kind we have today, but one where you directly connect your mind to the computer and experience the virtual world like it was real. Could the nerd be lucky enough to meet a hot girl in the virtual space, maybe playing a game or while he is hosting a D&amp;D campaign virtually?


* **A Heroine's Fall** - There is nothing I enjoy more than playing as the bad guys who fight against a heroine of some sort, usually more in the sense of a demon/evil manifestation fighting against a girl with magical powers, simply defeating her isn't enough it's showing her what she get for defying them in the first place, all the wonderful pleasures and pains, humiliation and mind breaking they will make her endure.


* **The MCU** - Involving some of the lovely ladies of the MCU like Black Widow, Wanda, Mantis, Gamora, and Captain Marvel with another super-hero, villain or even just an adoring fan.


* **Big Bang Theory** - I always thought it would be fun to play out an idea where Sheldon has had enough of Penny and decides to teach her a lesson with science and his very large cock.


* **Sex Robot**- This nerd either builds or finds and repairs a sex robot as it can look more/less like a robot or more/less human I am open in those regards. This can go a number of ways of him using her privately and her malfunctioning (think he enables ""Suck Dry"" routine and she has a glitch in her code, as she just sucks harder each time he cums unable to stop.) Other ideas can be he brings her around with him, showing her off like she is a real girl and is his new girlfriend which can be more like him living his fantasy or it becoming more of a nightmare as others grow jealous and torment him.


* **Celebrities** - I am sure there are more celebrities I would love to play with, in a roleplay but here is my shortlist Olivia Wilde, Scarlett Johanson, Kristin Ortega, and Ana De Armas


* **Rule 34**- I know a number of movies, shows, games, and characters if you have an idea that involves Rule 34 I am always open to hear ideas and see if I can make it work. Some of my favorites are Mass Effect, Dark Matter, Pokemon, The MCU, and DCU.


**I am up to discuss other ideas and even brainstorm together, as I do have a darker side if you like things kinkier, non-con and mean.**


My short list of kinks: blowjobs, face/throat fucking, deepthroating, excessive cum, cumplay, huge/thick cocks, breast/nipple play, fucking, and anal.

[F4A] Superheroine Gets Captured and Corrupted,"Hi, I’m Ellie, and I’m looking for a detailed, literate partner who’d like to do a Superheroine roleplay with me. I don’t mind if you’d like to play as a male, female, or futa character. I’d strongly prefer to play as the Superheroine, and your character is discussed more below. 

There are plenty of creative and fun options we could use for your character. Whether you’re my arch nemesis, a famous super villain, a crazed fan, or even just some kind of alien/monster, the choice is all yours to make. 

There are multiple different ways this scenario could start. You could lure me into some kind of trap, and then ambush me as my guard’s down. Or maybe you manage to somehow figure out my true identity and use it to blackmail me. Or you could even just track me down and ambush me at any kind of location. 

Once you’ve got me right where you want me, I’d love for you to begin corrupting my character, turning her from a powerful Superheroine into a horny slut begging for more. I’d prefer for this process to be more gradual, rather than instantaneous. Perhaps you inject me with some sort of aphrodisiac that highly increases my libido? Or maybe you hypnotise me to do your bidding?

I’d be willing to play as almost any Marvel/DC Superheroine you’d like, but some of my personal favourites are:
- [Scarlet Witch](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQMSw8Y9KhwbVttIwji9FjdF83ogX4FHreSeS9AZIVRU_5CrE-6) 
- Black Widow
- Wonder Woman
- Captain Marvel
- Spider-Gwen
- Starfire
- Raven 
- Gamora
- Batwoman
- Elastigirl
- Violet Parr 


My kinks are: teasing, name calling, seduction, corruption, transformation, bimbofication, tittyfucks, facials, tight clothes/sexy outfits, dry humping, fingering, lots of cum, spanking, anal, toys, dub-con, squirting, futa, incest, orgasm control/denial, edging, and hypnosis/mind control. 

My limits are the standard scat, piss, gore, feet etc.
 
So if you’d like to fulfill your fantasy of any Superheroine, feel free to DM me.

Hope to see you there :)",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgodys/f4a_superheroine_gets_captured_and_corrupted/,,Ellie123411,fgodys,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgodys/f4a_superheroine_gets_captured_and_corrupted/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fgodys/f4a_superheroine_gets_captured_and_corrupted/,0,2020-03-11
M4A Wish-Granter || Rule34 Reverse Rape || Futa Takeover,"You are bound to me now. I summoned you from whatever plane of existence you were in before, whether it was hell, heaven, or wherever. Now you are here, in my bedroom, realizing your form is anchored to within 25 feet of me at all times, and my word is law to you. What I say goes. And when I realize you can bend reality, grant wishes, and basically do what you want without consequence, I decide to turn you into a wish-cow. You can twist and bend them or you can take it literally. Wishes could change the world entirely, or just create a new scenario wherever we are. 

This isn't a genie. I dont have three wishes. I have *unlimited* wishes. And I will use plenty of them. 

~~

So thats my prompt. I basicallt want someone who will play a supernatural companion and the scenarios I make. I like to switch so I am **specifically looking for switches.**

**I dont use kik**

I have a lot of kinks and only a few limits!

**Prepare for Weird.**

______

One day, sometime late in the year of 2018, the world was changed by a being who visited earth. It took a female form, but with a large cock on display. Nearly 16 inches of thick girl meat. She was beautiful, taking the form of each person's fantasy girl to them. She spoke to everyone at once, explaining how she was going to transform the world. All women will now have grow penises. Never less than 8 inches. However, the balls they grow are small and weak, but they will also gain a new ability. Each new futa girl had stretchy urethras and now had the ability to, quite literally, suck the balls out of men or other futas. Balls that are stolen will add potency and weight to the futa's. 

Of course, the new 'females' were fine at first, not needing it, but eventually, the being saw nothing happening then instilled the need into them all. Now every woman was on a quest to steal as many balls as possible. Just as well, women were also able to steal inches from men after their balls. 

Futas quickly took over and began to overpower the men they could, stealing their balls and feminizing them to show their balls were already gone. Men might also be locked into chastity as they are rendered effectively useless. The futas created a new regime, a sort of new world order. And with any regime, there was a resistance, of mostly males attempting to take power back. Unfortunately, fighting usually involved death, wrestling and balls being stolen. 

And the worse thing was, the longer this war went on the more things futas seemed to be able to steal, soon even able to steal IQ!

Im planning to topple this regime as a resistanc leader, but will I be able to avoid having my balls stolen?

_____

This whole prompt was inspired by a few pictures if youre interested.

Theres my idea, it is indeed very weird and I dont expect a large amount of responses but I do want to clarify:

**Im looking for someone to play a futa or multiple futas, or if you're feeling generous, play a GM role in a long term world building rp!**

I do not play on kik, only reddit. 

I have a lot of kinks and few limits. My limits are scat, rimming, inflation, unrealistic female sizes (i.e. tits, hips, ass).

How I taught myself to view past lives,"     To give some history to this disciplinary journey, I will begin with my childhood. My earliest memories are from my crib. I was an articulate speaker by age three. My mother has told me stories of how I would have visions and see into the future at a young age. By age 4 I announced to my parents that I was a Christian and ""needed to be baptised"". By age 5 I was obsessed with classical music, especially pieces by Mozart. I loved horses and during my elementary years begged my parents for a violin, and to let me work with horses. My mother signed me up for piano lessons - my mother said I would listen to the piece, play it by ear and never read the sheet music. By age 8 I remember clearly having a strong sense of exactly who I was, what I was and that I felt ""older"" than a kid. Everything I did in childhood and adolescence I excelled at, and was often left with a feeling of contentment but a sense of, ""I've already done that."" I was an avid reader by 2nd grade and began writing poetry soon after. Sometimes I felt like I already knew how to do things, and I did. Above all, I have always felt a strong sense of how beautiful this world is, regardless of time and circumstance.

    By the time I was 9 I was lucid dreaming and could fly in my dreams. Around age 11 I learned how to control my dreams and how to change from first person to third person and back again. This is when I began dreaming about a manor house somewhere in the European countryside. I was a different version of me. 

     As a teen I was homeless for a while and I knew what to do and I knew that my situation was temporary and that I would be fine. Nothing surprised me and I often experienced events with a remoteness compared to the emotional reactions of my peers. Again, I always noted how beautiful and amazing this world is, never missing an opportunity to share in small moments of joy. 

      I didn't really date anyone until I met my husband on a blind date when I was 23. I never wasted my time dating because I ""knew"" the one would appear at some point in my life. He did. We knew almost immediately that we were soul mates. Complete opposites - me, a scholarly woman who grew up in the city in another state, and him - a country man from the deep south. He and I aligned and it all clicked. That is when I started trying to discipline myself to see our past lives together.

     At first, I could lucid dream about small moments in past lives - and these dreams differed from regular imaginative dreams. The details in lucid dreams are visceral - colors are more intense, sounds are crisp, reality is even more real than waking life. I practiced the art of waking slowly - into an almost meditative state - so that I could control my exit from the dreams in the morning. If I awoke too fast, I would only remember fragments or residual emotions. The best past life dreams happened when I could awaken naturally, without an alarm (perhaps on an off day or a weekend). 

     I began concentrating on a question before I went to sleep. I would empty my mind into a blank canvas and ask where will we go? Show me a life. Where did we live? Once in a while, it worked like a charm. 

     Some examples of my past life dreams: I saw my husband and I living in a cottage. I was short with curly red hair and freckles and a round face. He was blond. It was me, my soul, and I immediately recognized him as the soul he is today. We were married. He was a blacksmith. We lived on a farm. We were Irish. Another time I saw us - we were old with weathered faces. His eyes sparkled and he had a grey beard. My hands were weathered and crooked, but they held his calloused hands. We were sitting on a bench at a house in a large open field, watching the sunset. I had an overwhelming sense of peace and love. I was watching the sky's beauty unfold and thinking about how I was in the sunset of our life, our relationship, our journey - I was content. I knew I had known this life many times over. 

     Another time I was a Dutch woman who had a magnificent kitchen in my home - I cooked and baked to earn money. My daughter had long dark hair and I recognized her soul to be one of my closest friends in this life. We were preparing a feast for her fiance's visit. There was a knock on the door and when she opened the door, her fiance was her partner in this current life, only she was a blond, curly-haired man in the past life. I remember knowing I was a widow, but that the sting of loss had dissipated, so perhaps my husband died many years before. I remember feeling so incredibly proud of my daughter in that life.

     Recently I was meditating during an acupuncture session and I had a lucid dream. I was sitting on a fallen tree in a forest, next to a stream. I was wearing jeans and a hoodie. I knew someone was standing behind me. They placed their hand on my shoulder. I felt strength and comfort and an intelligence beyond words. In a flash the person was standing 6 feet in front of me, facing me. She was a native American woman, about 17 years old, with long black braids. She and I stared at one another - gazed at one another - for a long time. We understood one another. Somehow I knew her name was Little Crow. Our appreciation for one another, and our mutual respect, was overwhelming. We never spoke a word.

     As I continued to practice lucid dreaming and seeking my past lives, I once met a woman who is a seer. She invited me to have a session with her and without saying a word to her, this woman knew everything about me. She truly had the gift. She told me that I have had countless lives - close to 1000 - and that I had even altered my fate, which takes a strong-willed and stubborn person to do. She said I should be in a completely different place with different circumstances but that I had purposefully disrupted my own fate several times. She told me that there were several people in this life who knew me in my past lives. 

     She told me about my husband and how we have been together somehow in every life except one (apparently I died very young in that one). She then told me that in our most recent life he and I were a Chinese couple. We had no children but that we were wealthy and shared all we had with our community, taking care of everyone. She said our village loved us and had great respect for us. Why is this so accurate? In THIS life my husband is an Alabama-born white male who seems like an educated redneck...until he removes his clothes. He is covered in thirteen Chinese dragon tattoos, the first of which he got at age 18. If you ask him why he has Chinese dragons all over his body he will tell you, ""That is my totem."" He is also a blacksmith in this life (he has been before - in Ireland). 

    I DO believe our past lives carry over whether we realize how or not. I believe the older your soul, the more you ""know"". I believe we can access those past life memories in various ways, but dreams have worked best for me (I have tried hypnotism twice, but it did not work on me.) I believe that we can change gender in past lives, although I have been a female in the lives I remember thus far. I believe we can have a particular place, like a bookmark, where we often go. For me, it is the manor house. I have returned to that house many many times over the years. Why? Perhaps I lived there. Is it a real place? I sure hope so. I know every detail of it from my visitations. I believe we do connect with those we've known before in each of our lives, some way, somehow. I believe our phobias in this life can be caused by events which happened in another life. Me? You won't catch me out in the middle of the ocean. Ever. It is the only phobia I have, and I have not yet discovered why. I suspect it has something to do with one of my past lives. 

     I keep a journal of my past life dreams - and I love trying to correlate those lives with fragments in this life. If you keep a journal, be as detailed in your descriptions as you can, including emotions and people, surroundings and even languages. And above all, never forget to stop and take note of the amazing beauty in this world. Life is hard, and bad things happen to good people. Death happens and loss is inevitable. What keeps us coming back? The beauty in this world, and the love. I have always been a fatalist in this life. I am not afraid of death. 

     At the end of my session with the Seer, she said, ""This is your last life, if you choose for it to be."" I have a strong feeling I will be back for more.",pastlives,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pastlives/comments/fgokp7/how_i_taught_myself_to_view_past_lives/,,oshaughnessygirl,fgokp7,/r/pastlives/comments/fgokp7/how_i_taught_myself_to_view_past_lives/,https://www.reddit.com/r/pastlives/comments/fgokp7/how_i_taught_myself_to_view_past_lives/,15,2020-03-11

"Disney Has Begun Delaying Films, What Happens if Black Widow is next?","https://twitter.com/AaronCouch/status/1238220468898811905

So Disney has delayed Mulan, New Mutants, &amp; Antlers. They seem to be holding off on BW until their hand is forced. But it seems almost like a when not an if at this point. 

Now comes to our community. We know that MFF updates are planned &amp; worked on months in advance. So the question becomes, is NM still allowed to release the update next month even if the movie is delayed out of May? There’s the argument that the game only ever spoils a few things, from possibly uniforms to the Legendary Battle scenes. But if they are not given the green light, do we know what happens? Would it be possible to swap that update with one that was supposed to follow it? I’m guessing a lot depends on the timing of the delay. But this was just something I thought about when seeing this news.

Fandom Gender Changing Machine!,"I am 18+ and all partners and characters must be 18+ 

So I had an idea recently involing a rather weird kink but it would invole lots of action and adventure!  Romance and lots of smut!. 

And no you cant use ocs stop asking. 

I will stricly play male and you will play the female former male. Which means and I cannot stress this enough!  (I will not play female you will.) No futas or shemales. 

(I really want to focus on the romance as well cus I'm kind of sad and dealing with a ton.) 


The kink is feminzation transforming a gruff male into a beatiful female!. 


Plot idea: You are my male bully a mean and callus young man.. Who enjoys tormenting and pushing me around.. I am a geeky sciance nerd in love with the concepts of video games and comic books.  Almost to an insane point.. Where it prompts me to create something that could change the world.. A machine that can change and alter gender.. Thats right!  This device I have created it can alter the world we know it.. And I had created for my school sciance fair,  at least I had till one faithful day within the school gym. It was a gender changing device but I had programed it with only four apearnches.. That of my favorite all time fictional characters.  I sit within the gym tinkering with my amazing device that was until you came the local meat head.. My bully.. You began pushing me around and before I could make my adjustments you took the device turning it on causing it to explode transforming you into one of these characters.  The hearts are who I like the most.

DOes the release model for this game seem underwhelming?,"With LOTR and Arkham, you get player cards and an amazing new adventure to play

With Marvel:LCG and (IMO) their terrible decision to 'pre package decks' (why!) with a bunch of duplicate cards and a semi playable deck and no adventure to play against well... I got Thor today and I opened it up and I looked over the cards and I thought well.. thats it. I dont want to fight goblin again, or any of the core box stuff, so I just stored all the cards

And next is black widow and Dr strange... same problem here. Nothign to do with them. 

Imagine if you will, a world where you grab thor, you flip that sucker over, and Loki is on the back and you got someone to play AND someone to fight. We'd have an extra 3 villain sets to play against ATM, and 3 more to come before the next big box!

Its not like theres any shortage of villains to pick from, and they needent have included side sets either, just make each one have an interesting mechanic and let us use all the side sets we already have

So what do we all think will be the greater ramifications of the Coronavirus on the MCU / movie industry as a whole?,"With major movies like Fast 9 and A Quiet Place delayed, will Black Widow be next?
Will this lead to a chain reaction of movies being pushed back, in turn causing production of future movies to be delayed?
Is the movie industry as a whole going to suffer major loss?
Will it even matter by next year if the pandemic is not over by then?

Disney + Releases for Black Widow and Mulan,"Maybe too late for Mulan but good chance Black Widow is available on Disney + on the release date with an up charge to watch. 

Makes a lot of sense:

1) Movie attendance will be down for the foreseeable future 
2) Disney + saw a big decline since the initial buzz and this would spawn new sign ups 
3) People will pay to see the movie when it first comes out especially if we’re spending more time inside

Think of a pay per view fight but for movies. Could be a genius play to save their tail and not push back the release date which would sink all the marketing costs.

The Black Widow and Her Barflies,"___Note: this story was originally released on May 2nd, 2019.___

It can be hard to find good conversation in Portland nowadays. People tend to keep to themselves because the streets are filled with beggars and crazies- take a bus ride across town or a walk around Pioneer Square and you'll see what I mean. If you're looking for conversation with complete strangers, that's pretty much all the city has to offer you.

Or at least that's the case during the daytime. The homeless tend to bunker down in the evening- so long as they can find somewhere dry where they'll be left alone for a while- and the nutbars are usually home or passed out in some gutter. The rest of the city comes alive at night. It might not look like it at first, but if you find the right places, you can practically see the electricity in the air.

Well, maybe that's the neon signs, because I'm talking about the bars and nightclubs.

There's something immortal about those places. Nowadays people looking for a connection have their apps, their social medias, but nothing beats going somewhere, getting blasted and hooking up with a stranger. Civilizations rise and fall, but the drunken one night stand persists. It's one of the only undying human traditions- hell, it's older than church.

The whole 'hookup culture' thing isn't _my_ scene, but I've never had a problem with other people taking part. In a way, I was grateful for it, because it gave me solid work. It's hard to find a good bartender, but it's easy to find a job as one. People need to drink, right?

I left it behind last week, though. I didn't know that I was building up to it until I quit, but here I am, applying to entry-level positions in fields I have no experience in. The money's better behind the bar, but I can't take it anymore.

It wasn't the work- that was easy. So long as you can handle stress and remember people's orders, it's a breeze. I know my way around a drink, so that came in handy. Busy shifts go quick, too, and that's a major plus.

The trouble came from the slow moments, when the place _wasn't_ busy. You'd see people at their most pathetic or, worse, their most predatory. Loners would nurse their drinks after striking out, feeling sorry for themselves or hoping that someone would come around to sweep them off their feet. Drunks would go home with other drunks, happier to settle than be alone. Creeps would pour drinks in whoever they could, trying to lower their prey's inhibitions... or at least their motor functions.

Of course, I got paid to take part in this, feeding everyone their drinks and listening to their problems. In a real, undeniable way, I profited off of the loneliness of others. I hate myself for it, but I went with it because I had some debts to pay off and knew I could live with myself. No one's an angel, right?

But there are devils. I know that much. I've seen one, but at first I had no idea what I was looking at.

I was working the bar on another agonizingly slow night, a few months back, when I first saw her. It was a weeknight, so people started going home pretty early. One guy had been throwing his own little pity party for the last few hours after striking out, and he was the only person at the bar. I hated when guys like that tried to socialize with me, but this loner was thankfully quiet, so I was cool with him. He was a regular, so this wasn't the first time I'd seen him do this to himself, but that didn't make it easy to watch all over again.

It's tough to see when people start their night ordering drinks in the hopes that they'll have a good time, and keep ordering when things don't go their way. If they don't get on my nerves in the process, I tended to root for them near the end of the night. It was usually an exercise in futility, but it made a game out of an otherwise sad situation. I was playing that game with this guy, as I had during most of his previous visits, and I assumed at the time that his night would be just as uneventful as all the others.

It was just past 1:30 when she walked in. I remember that clearly because I was thinking about how I only had another hour left before I could close up for the night. It's rare to see anyone arrive that late, and usually the people who do are already drunk, looking for somewhere to keep the booze flowing after getting kicked out of another bar. This woman, however, was sober.

Sober and sobering.
 
She walked in and the mood changed. All eyes were on her, even the unfocused, glazed over eyes of my plastered patrons. Her black dress was flattering but not provocative, like something a First Lady would wear. She had long brown hair in a ponytail, just long enough for the end of it to rest on her shoulder. She smiled welcomingly, but her piercing blue eyes were intimidating to look at head-on. I stared back at her and nodded, but most people looked down at their drinks when she looked at them. She commanded attention and projected authority; she was like a queen... or a goddess.

After her gaze washed over everyone in the room, the woman's attention turned to the loner. He was one of the few to stare back, and he smiled meekly at her. To my surprise, she walked over and took a seat right by him. ""What are you drinking?"" she asked, her voice sweet as honey.

""My sorrows,"" the man replied with a sheepish grin. Up close, he couldn't keep eye contact.

The woman didn't seem to mind. She took a closer look at his drink. ""Looks like scotch to me.""

""You got me,"" he admitted, glancing up at her before looking back down to his drink. _Yeah she does,_ I thought. _She's got you in the palm of her hand._

""I think I'll have one of the same,"" she decided. BY the time she looked over, I already had the bottle in hand.

""On the rocks?"" I asked.

""Please."" Her smile could melt hearts.

As I set the drink before her, the loner raised his glass. ""Another for me, please, and put her drink on my tab.""

""You bet,"" I nodded. _And good luck, pal._

I spent the next hour doing what I always did when something interesting was happening at the bar- eavesdropping while making myself look busy. The woman was clearly in control, but she seemed to pull the best of this loner out of him. I'd seem him strike out with countless women over the months since he'd become a regular, but damn if he wasn't a charmer that night. Witty jokes, sarcastic responses to everything she said, this guy was on a roll.

When I made last call, they each ordered another scotch and the loner settled his tab. As he took a swig of his drink, the loner started looking nervous. I'd seen this before with countless guys; he wanted to seal the deal, but didn't know how to do it. _Take it home,_ I thought, rooting for him as I had so many times before.. _She went ninety, you just need to go the last ten._

""So..."" he started, taking a look around as the other patrons started filing out. ""I, uh... I saw you here last weekend.""

""Oh?"" She seemed thrown off by this. It must have been a night I didn't work, otherwise I would have remembered her.

""Yeah,"" he said. ""You... you left with some other guy."" _Christ, that's a fumble,_ I thought.

""I did,"" she admitted shamelessly. ""Are you okay with that?""

After a long pause, he finally nodded. ""I guess so, if you're leaving with me tonight."" I couldn't help but smile, so I turned away.

""Well, in that case, let's get going."" Not wasting any time, the loner grabbed his jacket, flashed an 'I can't believe my luck' smile at me, and left with the most beautiful woman either of us had ever seen.

And that's the last time I ever saw him.

I saw the woman a couple weeks later, though. Same bar, same quiet weeknight vibe, same late night arrival. She didn't look the same, though.

It was a busier night, with a large group of college kids taking up a lot of my time and attention, so I didn't catch much of her. I did, however, remember the moment she walked in. Just like before, the entire vibe of the room changed. I saw dozens of patrons turning their heads, trying to get a good look at the piece who just walked in. Before I even took a look, I knew who to expect.

She was wearing a short red dress, showing off legs and cleavage like she'd just come from a nightclub. Her hair was much longer, curly and black as night; it made her look pale by comparison, or did she have a tan the first time? If I didn't know any better, I would have assumed that I'd never seen her before. Her eyes, though, were the same electric blue that they'd been before.

The woman practically skipped to the bar and leaned over the counter, giving anyone nearby quite the view. ""Hey,"" she called out to me in a bubbly voice, ""could I get a beer, please?""

""Any preference?"" I asked back, setting down a pitcher one of the college kids had just paid for.

""Surprise me,"" she suggested.

I smiled, trying to keep eye contact instead of letting my eyes wander. ""Okay, I'll surprise us both."" I grabbed a beer from below the bar at random and handed it to her.

""Thanks,"" she said, smiling devilishly. ""How much?""

""Put it on my tab,"" one of the older guys at the bar offered quickly, almost desperately.

""Will do,"" I confirmed. The woman sat with the older guy and I moved on to the next order from the other end of the bar.

I'd seen that guy in the bar a few times before. He wasn't a regular, but he stayed at the bar all day whenever he did stop by. That day, he'd been there since before I even started my shift, and I was sure that he'd still be there by the time I announced last call.

I didn't pay close attention to the two of them, but I caught snippets of conversation. He was telling her all about the crazy stuff he got up when he was her age. Sounded like bullshit to me, but I had no reason to chime in. Besides, I was busy filling orders and keeping an eye on the college kids.

Before I made last call, the older guy and the woman were out the door. A friend of his came back from the bathroom and realized that he'd been ditched. ""Hey,"" he asked me when I had a free moment, ""did you see my pal leave? He was just smooth-talking that skank a few minutes ago.""

I looked around and shrugged. ""Guess he left. Lucky him.""

""Goddammit, he was my ride home,"" he cursed. ""I live in Gresham. What the hell am I supposed to do now?""

""Well,"" I suggested, ""the busses that way are gonna stop running soon, so you should get going before you're stuck in the middle of town.""

Grumbling, he paid his tab and went on his way.

The friend was back a few days later, asking around. His friend wasn't answering his calls, and his friend's daughter was looking for him. I promised to keep an eye out for the guy, but I never saw him again. I didn't see the woman at that bar again, either, but I did cross paths with her again.

A week ago, I saw this woman for the last time. I was working an extra shift at a different bar that my boss owned, filling in so the usual bartender could walk his kid down the aisle. The pay was good and I didn't have anything to go home to, so I took the hours.

This place served food, so most of the patrons were in their booths, and almost all of my orders were picked up by waitresses and served to the tables. It was a nicer place than I was used to, and after some personal stuff I'd gone through recently, a change like this felt good.

There were a couple barflies, though, guys who spent hours drinking and talking at the bar every weeknight. I wasn't their usual guy, so I kept my distance as well as I could.

Frankly, they seemed kind of annoying. From what I couldn't help but overhear, they worked at an office together. One of them loved to whine and the other loved giving advice, but neither of them seemed to have a lick of common sense.

Tonight, the whiner was talking about how poorly his recent attempts at using dating apps was going. His friend was explaining the process of catfishing. ""Just say you're over six feet in your profile and they'll start swiping right. Everyone lies online. Half the girls you'll match with are secret fatties who take advantage of filters and Photoshop. That's why I always hang out across the street from wherever I'm supposed to meet a girl, so I can just ghost her if she's too chunky in person.""

""How do you handle it when they get mad at you?"" the whiner asked.

""I tell them to eat a salad and block 'em.""

""Just like that?""

""Just like that."" They high fived and my stomach turned.

After a while, the guys started getting antsy about something. I didn't know what until it happened a little after midnight, when a group of strippers who'd just got off work walked in and sat in a booth. The guys went over with a pitcher after a few minutes and started chatting them up. _Good riddance,_ I thought, sick of having to listen to them.

I had the bar to myself for a while when she walked in, this time in jeans and a green and white PSU sweatshirt. I noticed her before everyone else did, but I could see from how she looked around the place that the woman had everyone attention like she always did. Her hair was short, strawberry blonde this time, and again she looked almost like an entirely different person.

She recognized me, too, and for the second time I could see that she was thrown off. Clearly this woman was going to great lengths to not be recognized, and I was getting in the way of that. She considered me for a moment, and I could see the mask of whatever personality she planned to go with that night slip away.

Then she settled on accepting it and took a seat at the bar. ""You get around,"" she noted.

""I would say the same if it didn't sound too judgy,"" I replied. ""Want a drink?""

""Yeah, whatever you got,"" she said, clearly uninterested in drinking. She took another glance around the bar and turned back to me. ""Slow night?""

""Like pulling teeth,"" I joked, giving her a bottle at random as I'd done before.

""You want some company?"" she asked bluntly. I knew exactly what she meant.

""Not looking for any,"" I admitted, shaking my head. ""Just went through a bad breakup. It wouldn't feel right.""

""That's a shame,"" she said, looking back at the mostly empty booths. ""The place seems dead.""

""Well, whatever you're looking for, I'm sure you can still find it somewhere.""

She took a swig of her drink. ""Here's hoping.""

""Hey,"" I asked. ""That guy you left with a while back, the older guy. What happened with him? I hear his kid's looking for him.""

She shrugged innocently. ""I don't kiss and tell, but I'm sure he's fine. He seemed happy when I last saw him.""

I left it at that. And for a couple hours, that's what it was. The rest of the patrons stayed in their groups, slowly leaving whenever they needed to head home, and the woman nursed her drink at the bar while occasionally looking around for someone to connect with. I kept my distance when I could, replacing her drink without a word whenever she asked for a new one.

Just before last call, one of the annoying barflies left with one of the strippers. When the rest of the strippers left a few minutes later, the only person left at the booth was the whiner, who was resting his head in his hands. The moment she noticed, the woman ordered two more drinks, settled her tab and sauntered over the booth.

Within a few minutes, the woman and her new friend were leaving the bar together, just before last call.

After clearing the place out, I told the manager that I was all set and took off. I was parked in a garage down the block, so I made my way over, ready to go home after the strangely stressful shift.

The garage's elevator was out, so I had to take the stairs to get to my car, which I'd parked halfway up. I entered the stairwell and immediately heard the loud echoes of moaning from above. _Good acoustics,_ I remember thinking.

Before I could leave the stairwell, I heard the... _conclusion..._ of the moaning. I stifled a laugh, then decided to just walk up the ramps instead of intrude on their fun, even if it might have just wrapped up. Just as I walked out of the stairwell, though, I heard a different sound. It was an echoing, high-pitched screaming.

""Get off me!"" someone yelled. ""HELP! Someone he-""

Then silence.

I held the door open, stunned, not daring to make a sound. This was a different kind of electricity in the air than I was used to- danger.

My ears were ringing in the silence before finally tuning into something from above. It sounded almost like a slurping noise. I took a light step into the stairwell, making sure not to move the door at all.

The slurping got louder, like someone sipping their drink before it could overflow. It was a sound I knew well. Then I heard something from above me crack, and the slurping was replaced by a heavy swallowing.

""Hello?"" I called out, unable to even guess what was happening up there.

There was a scuffling above. I stepped into the stairwell and looked up, just in time to see something yellow fall down the space between the winding stairs. It landed right in front of me, on the ground level of the stairwell. It was her hair. I didn't even know she was wearing a wig.

""Hey, what the hell's going on?"" I called out, storming up the stairs.

I stormed up the stairs as fast as I could, and almost tripped over the body on the fourth floor's landing. The pool of blood was already forming from the bite marks on the whiner's snapped neck, and his eyes were open, lifeless.

I left the stairwell on that floor and pulled out my phone. My stomach was turning, and I sucked in the cool night air while calling 911. As the automated response warned me not to call unless it was an emergency, I could hear running from one of the floors above.

A figure fell from the top floor of the garage, all the way to the sidewalk. I looked over the edge, assuming that the woman had just committed suicide, and saw that she'd landed on her feet. I could see her bald head in the dim streetlights. She wiped her bloodstained mouth clean and started running down the street, turning at the next intersection and out of view.

I told the police everything I know, but either they've kept their investigation's developments away from the media or they've made no progress so far. They're not returning my calls, either.

I couldn't set foot in another bar since seeing what I did, but I sure am drinking a lot more. I can't help but think about that whiner, that barfly who got pulled in when he was so close to going home alone. If I didn't turn that woman down, he'd be fine. I accept that, but I don't know if I can live with it.

Maybe I'll take a walk tonight, right when the sun goes down. I'm sure there are some people trolling the streets, looking to make another connection. I'll be so hammered that I might not even recognize her.

A rumor,"I read a rumor online that at this time Disney still intends to release Black Widow on May 1st, but this might be postponed due to Corona Virus. If that is the case i read they could push it back to the schedule spot of Eternals in November. Im really hoping this is not the case and they will release it on May 1st. Regardless of the movie schedule, March is supposed to be the Black Widow True Believers month, will they keep that schedule if they move the movie schedule? Best case scenario this Corona thing will blow over.

Gives the movies a larger audience since everyone's gonna be stuck at home

[Black Widow] Taskmaster is an Android.,"Since Taskmaster has the ability to copy moves from each Avenger, it could be a possibility that Taskmaster is actually an advanced android programmed by the Red Room to assassinate other Black Widows. Looking back at Age of Ultron, Ultron was programmed with both Stark’s ego and his Iron Man abilities. Taskmaster in this case, has photographic reflexes which allows it to copy the moves of the Avengers with photographic or film memory. In the Black Widow trailer, Taskmaster learned Natasha’s moves by watching film of her battling enemies. Overall, this speculates that Taskmaster could be an Android programmed by the Red Room to learn the abilities from Avenger members by watching film and use those skills in combat to battle other Black Widows including Natasha.",FanTheories,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/fhox4n/black_widow_taskmaster_is_an_android/,Marvel,Lucaswebb,fhox4n,/r/FanTheories/comments/fhox4n/black_widow_taskmaster_is_an_android/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/fhox4n/black_widow_taskmaster_is_an_android/,5,2020-03-12
Coronavirus and the DCP: An inside perspective,"Hi everyone, I'm currently accepted to do my second CP this upcoming Fall as Merch in WDW. My family has worked for the Walt Disney Company in one role or another for the past 45 years and in my immediate family alone I have a handful of relatives working in high up positions within the company so I thought my insight would be appreciated. As I type this Disney shares sit at $93.50 which is the lowest in 3 years.



First things first - Walt Disney World and Disneyland both will close due to the coronavirus outbreak. The insurance liability of operating a public crowded space of tens of thousands is reason enough for this. Additionally, the bad PR caused by someone dying from Disney-contracted coronavirus will do more to sink Disney stock than any Disney+ or Bob Iger fiasco. Lastly, the Company does have a heart and generally would prefer not to increase global suffering during a pandemic. No one has any idea how long the parks will close but expect it to be at least 2 months and I would not be surprised if they canceled the 2020 Fall DCP as a whole due to MASSIVELY reduced guest numbers which will result in a huge lack of hours for PT/FT let alone CPs. Spring CPs currently working at the parks should start formulating their plan B - WDW could very easily close tomorrow indefinitely and thousands of you could be laid off. 


Secondly, as a whole company Disney will be hit very hard by this. There is no way Black Widow is released on time or will have the financial success to offset the blow to other parts of the company (which I will get to later). This would push the entire MCU back at least 6 months including movies that are currently in production (which would be halted regardless because 500 people on a movie set in LA is a coronavirus hot bed). 


Disney Cruises? I don't even need to touch on this - suffice to say they're done.


Disney+? Expected to bring in only 3 billion with 1 billion in production costs for the first year alone. These numbers are not enough to hold up the company especially with all the resources that were poured into it to make it semi-successful. 


Disney Stores in malls will be massively hit.


 ABC and ESPN as divisions of the company will take massive nose dives - no NHL, no NCAA, no NBA. 


There's so much more I have to say on this topic so feel free to comment with questions but TL;DR: the DCP for Fall 2020 will be canceled or greatly reduced. Since Disney is an at-will employment company expect to see thousands of offers revoked between now and August. Disney will be hit bad but your health is paramount. Wash your hands and start planning for a backup if your offer is revoked.",Disneycollegeprogram,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneycollegeprogram/comments/fhlhsk/coronavirus_and_the_dcp_an_inside_perspective/,,Positive-Title,fhlhsk,/r/Disneycollegeprogram/comments/fhlhsk/coronavirus_and_the_dcp_an_inside_perspective/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneycollegeprogram/comments/fhlhsk/coronavirus_and_the_dcp_an_inside_perspective/,47,2020-03-12

BLACK WIDOW IS A GAME!,"Just thought maybe the Black Widow program is a freaking game. It’s some kind of new age live action video game for some fucked up people probably. The player would get to control a Widow agent and play some kind of real ass Fortnite. It’s the plot of Westworld but works real well in this Marvel format. Removes the stakes from the BW movie, but at least it wouldn’t bother the continuity. 

Taskmaster could be considered a developer in some ways. He started back up the BW program, mind wipes these women, turns their brains into mush, and gives the controls to the highest bidder. 


There has been some tease of sorts surrounding gaming. Plus marvel usually tackles modern issues and none more prevalent than the modern Battle Royal format of gaming. 


100 people drop in (Like in the trailer we see them dropping in to some remote place), 1 team or person wins. 


Plus you can change “Skins.” Considering the theory that there might be some face swapping in BW. 


THERES ALSO A OF TEASES TO GAMING. The gamer tease in Endgame. Ned in Far From Home was obsessed with gaming. Groot has been playing a handheld gaming device. Avengers has a galaga gamer being ousted. Tchalla and Tony have been in casinos which is gaming but not solid enough, I’d agree. 



What if Natasha goes looking for her family to help end the GAME that is being played with real peoples lives. Her retired family from the black program, being used as an Avatar. 


They steal young women, and force them into fighting whilst being controlled by a third party. 


Maybe Tony’s fighting analysis program is at its core. Maybe it was called  JOCASTA and maybe JOCASTA, Ultrons wife of sorts, reawakened the Black Widow program.

I love NuSele,"This tribe has the funniest dynamics out of any swap tribe ever on Survivor. It's like high school on steroids.

Parvati is the prom queen from ten years ago that still holds her title and makes boys lose their words.

She passes the torch to her cute little sister Michele that is evolving into the new black widow.

Wendell is the jock that plays it cool and won't be fully open about his relationship with Michele but totally gets owned by her.

Nick is the nerd who has a crush on the pretty girl and gushes just by standing next to her.

And Yul is probably the principal or the guy who doesn't care about high school drama and gets into the best university.

"I have been trying to make sense of my birth chart. I am a Libra sun, Scorpion Moon, Pisces Asc."," \[ Posting here because I don't get the rules on r/astrology \]

Honestly,  having this conjunct feels rather isolating. I don't feel like a libra  at all other than having a deep appreciation for what is beautiful, and a  well defined sense of what I like and dislike (as far as visuals,  appearance, etc is concerned). Indecisiveness was never a prominent  trait in myself. I don't think I am attractive like libras are supposed  to be (you can see for yourself, my ig is linked on my profile here). I  am not the girl of the parties, the one with hundreds of contacts and  friends. I do know a lot of people but I am so reserved that my  connections with them are mostly just ""knowing"" them, you know? Heck, I  look at my libra friend (only three years younger, her birthday being  six days before mine) and she embodies mostly everything about libra,  and I mean the actual things, not the dumb stereotypes.

Sure  enough, I know why I feel such a disconnection, as with having two  water signs as moon and asc, respectively. I feel much more like a  scorpio, but I can't call myself one, because I wasn't born after  October 23rd. The past few years were the times of really getting to  know myself and I embody so much of this particular sign. The attraction  for what is dark, hidden and sometimes repulsed by society (I mean soft  stuff like tattoos, piercings, mostly black clothing, ok? not creepy  shit); The intensity. Goddamn, why does everything has to be so intense?  I can't just like someone. I have to obsess to the point of almost  becoming that person. And who doesn't love taking five months to get  over someone?

Why can't I just  watch a film without diving deep into secret meanings, foreshadowing,  references, etc? This is a quality, and I love it, but sometimes it is  also very tiring. Sometimes I just want to do things. Like, I wish I  could be carefree, but it is not in my nature. Everything is slightly  calculated. There has to be a reason for me to do something. I have to  achieve value or help someone with an action, otherwise it is a waste of  time, why bother? Watch a random film in the movies? Sure, long as it  is a film that will help me in a way or another. Oh, it is a silly  repetitive romantic comedy? No, thank you.

It  seems like I am just bitching here but aside from falling in love being  super unfun to me because I always get fucked in the end, I don't mind  being this way. I just feel like I don't belong.

So  I decided my sign now is a spider. A spider embodies some traits of  Libra, beautifully balancing herself in her carefully and beautifully  crafted webs. A spider is closely related to scorpios, but they prefer  tall places, usually. Perhaps that gives them more of an Air quality.  Spiders can be dangerous just like her cousins scorpios. Many spiders  are also gorgeous to look at, such as the crab spider, or even the black  widow.

So instead of being a discount Libra, or the Scorpio that everyone will judge because of a birth date, I am now the spider.

You  can choose to take this post seriously or not. Also, I didn't mention  Pisces at all because I don't really know how it affects my life.

Taskmaster is black widow?,"I haven't watched the trailer as I don't watch trailers but I constantly think up theories and I have a theory that taskmaster is actually black widow from a future timeline, I as include in this that there are multiple versions of black widow due to the red Room cloning her, similar to the comics. Having a cloned version of black widow from the future coming back with time travel technology she stole from the avengers as well as that she has been studying the avengers over the years with both her memories of fighting battles side by side, reviewing footage that has been collected by shield and other organizations over the years as well as enhanced reflexes, attuned vision, increased durability and strength maybe due to experimental super serums or slight upgrades during the cloning process maybe genetic engineering or animal DNA tinting who knows what they could done during those times there were all sorts of governments experimenting. Anyway she could have been contracted by the red Room or other mercenaries who have hate for widow to hunt her down and kill her or more sinisterly to tear her life apart and force her to go back to the hell where she began. Widow will have a fight with seeing her future self and having to choose between becoming like her becoming the agent of red Room, the killer she was made to be or to choose the hero path, the struggle she has always dealt with but has never been fully explored in the mcu.

"I have been trying to make sense of my birth chart. I am a Libra sun, Scorpion Moon, Pisces Asc.","Honestly, having this conjunct feels rather isolating. I don't feel like a libra at all other than having a deep appreciation for what is beautiful, and a well defined sense of what I like and dislike (as far as visuals, appearance, etc is concerned). Indecisiveness was never a prominent trait in myself. I don't think I am attractive like libras are supposed to be (you can see for yourself, my ig is linked on my profile here). I am not the girl of the parties, the one with hundreds of contacts and friends. I do know a lot of people but I am so reserved that my connections with them are mostly just ""knowing"" them, you know? Heck, I look at my libra friend (only three years younger, her birthday being six days before mine) and she embodies mostly everything about libra, and I mean the actual things, not the dumb stereotypes.

Sure enough, I know why I feel such a disconnection, as with having two water signs as moon and asc, respectively. I feel much more like a scorpio, but I can't call myself one, because I wasn't born after October 23rd. The past few years were the times of really getting to know myself and I embody so much of this particular sign. The attraction for what is dark, hidden and sometimes repulsed by society (I mean soft stuff like tattoos, piercings, mostly black clothing, ok? not creepy shit); The intensity. Goddamn, why does everything has to be so intense? I can't just like someone. I have to obsess to the point of almost becoming that person. And who doesn't love taking five months to get over someone? 

Why can't I just watch a film without diving deep into secret meanings, foreshadowing, references, etc? This is a quality, and I love it, but sometimes it is also very tiring. Sometimes I just want to do things. Like, I wish I could be carefree, but it is not in my nature. Everything is slightly calculated. There has to be a reason for me to do something. I have to achieve value or help someone with an action, otherwise it is a waste of time, why bother? Watch a random film in the movies? Sure, long as it is a film that will help me in a way or another. Oh, it is a silly repetitive romantic comedy? No, thank you. 

It seems like I am just bitching here but aside from falling in love being super unfun to me because I always get fucked in the end, I don't mind being this way. I just feel like I don't belong. 

So I decided my sign now is a spider. A spider embodies some traits of Libra, beautifully balancing herself in her carefully and beautifully crafted webs. A spider is closely related to scorpios, but they prefer tall places, usually. Perhaps that gives them more of an Air quality. Spiders can be dangerous just like her cousins scorpios. Many spiders are also gorgeous to look at, such as the crab spider, or even the black widow. 

So instead of being a discount Libra, or the Scorpio that everyone will judge because of a birth date, I am now the spider. 

You can choose to take this post seriously or not. Also, I didn't mention Pisces at all because I don't really know how it affects my life.

Mortal Kombat 11 Shadow fan concept:,"So in case you don't know which probably you don't. Shadow is a main character from a mobile fighting game Shadow Fight 2 by Nekki. I'm aware that this is a WEIRD ASS request, but I think it would be cool since Shadow pretty much has every single weapon on this planet, plus he has demonic powers.

So his universal moves:

1. (B, F, 1) - Shuriken Toss (Fast high projectile, if you meter burn it it he throws two, and second one is a mid)
2. (D, F, 1) - Sword Parry (Parry, can hold it. it can counter all attacks. If you amplify it he starts moving forward with his spinning katanas. He can cut projectiles and parry normal attacks. If he amplifes it, and he slices a projectile and he comes to the opponent he'll imaple him with his katanas and it's a flat damage Krushing Blow.)
3. (D, F, 2) - Unstoppable Warrior (If you do this attack raw it'll just stun opponent a little bit if they're close to you. If you amplify it while being close it'll turn your opponents into stone. Kinda like Frost's attack. But this has a another strong thing. If opponent is doing kombo on you, this attack will stun them while they're doing kombo and now you can do kombo on them. But it takes one defensive and one offensive meter to do it.)
4. (D, U) - Down From Ashes (A qiuck teleport where he burns and spawns behind the opponent)

Variation 1 (Zoning):

1. (B, F, 1) - Magic Throw (This replaces his Shuriken. The attack is slower on start-up, but when he throws it it's lighting fast. It's a high but if you amplify it, it's a mid.)
2. (D, F, 3) - Shadow Levitation (Shadow flies up in the air and shoots a beam, similiar to Cetrion. This move is inspired by his boss in Shadow Fight 3. You have close and far version. If you amplify it, it'll take full screen. It's an overhead)
3. (B, F, 3) - Ground Pound (This is inspired by boss with Butcher in Shadow Fight 2. It's a low. He stops hard on the ground but if you amplify it, he does it twice.)
4. (D, B, F, 1) - Meteor Rain (Inspired by boss with Shogun in Shadow Fight 2. It's unblockable attack. But it's slow on start-up. You have close, very close, mid, far and very far versions)

Variation 2 (Pressure):

1. (B, F, 4) - Dragon Flight (Inspired by boss with Wasp in SF2. It's a mid. It's similiar to Raiden's fly, but he spawns a giant spear what he uses to imaple. Raw version is just a knockdown, but if you amplify it he imaples opponent with it and then throws him hard on the ground. He bounces and it's a kombo starter.)
2. (D, B, 2) - D-Coin (Shadow spawns a smokish version of himself that starts moving towards to opponent. You have multiple versions. Raw he just sends a shadow that walks toward him. When he's close to the opponent he'll stop and then he'll take damage over time. Similar to acid puddle. If you amplify it and hold F shadow will move much faster. When he comes to opponent he'll grab him and let player do a combo on him. If you held B shadow will move slow so opponent has to deal with it and you. If you held D, shadow will move normal pace, but when he comes he'll sweep the opponent. And if you hold U, shadow will grab opponent if they jump and re-stand them.)
3. (D, U) - Thunder Magic Aura (Inspired by Hermit boss in SF2. It's replaces his teleport. This attack sends Shadow in the air. He starts shooting thunders where you aim. It's unblockable but it's really slow on start-up. Then can jab you out of there with a projectile. But if you amplify it, they can only take you out if they hit you.)

Variation 3 (Kombo):

1. (D, D, 2) - Lynx Pose (This is a buff. It's inspired by Lynx's attacks in Shadow Fight 2. Shadow will get two claws on his hands and much bigger range on normal attacks. When he hits a opponent with his claws, after a couple of seconds they'll explode and it'll launch them into the air. So if you're doing a kombo with claws and opponent breaks away, when they fall on the floor they'll go in the air again so you can extend your kombos. It doesn last for too long but it's a big upgrade.)
2. (D, B, 1) - Demon Flip (Shadow flips into the air. It's a mid attack, but it's useless when you do it raw. The attack can help during kombos. If opponent is about to fall from the juggling, and you do a flip attack, opponent will go a little higher into the air which leaves you open for longer and more damaging kombos. Altought it'll only work if you amplify it and you can only amplify it once during a kombo.)
3. (B, F, 2) - Titan War (Shadow gets Titan's giant sword from Shadow Fight 2. He imaples opponent twice and then he throws them in the direction player chooses to. If you amplify it, it's a re-stand which leaves opportunity for more kombos.

Other Attacks:

1. (D, D, 4) - Air Pulse (Low hitting projectile, that starts kombso if you amplify it.)
2. (D, B, F, 1) - Saw Floor (Low hitting projectile. Shadow jumps into the air and a giant saw comes from the floor.)
3. (D, D, 1) - Warrior Buff (There are three versions of this attack and they all cost meter. If you hold F he gets a Poison Buff. his attacks take damage over time. If you hold B he gets Rage Buff. His attack are 10% stronger and his attack Unstoppable Warrior doesn't require meter to do. if you hold down he gets Armor Buff. He gets an armor.)
4. (D, F, 3) - Warrior Zone (There are two versions of this attack and they cost meter. If you hold F he spawns a Poison Zone, if opponent's in it, he'll loose health over time. If you hold B you spawn Buff Zone. Shadow gets health over time in that zone.)

&amp;#x200B;

Gear:

For Shadow's gear I would give him his Magic, Helmet and Chestplate. His magic could be designed to look how you want, either a fire ball, electric ball or a water ball. Helmet could be designed and inspired by actual helmets from SF2, same for Chestplate.

Skins:

All DLC character have 4 skins. His default is just shadowy black person with white eyes, he would also have a cell shaded style to him since he is from a 2D fighting game. Then he has a bunch of different shaders where his body and eye color change. His second skin is his human form. He wouldn't have anything crazy, but some tattoos and warrior body paint. Also different shaders. His third skin would look same when you upgrade your level as Shadow. He would have a neon light in his body. Color of his body and his lights would change with shaders. His fourth skin is tengu inspired. He would look like a demonic creature.

Fatal Blow:

His Fatal Blow would be him turning into all 7 bosses from SF2. His first attacks he turns into Lynx, Hermit and Butcher, then a slow-mo happens. Then he turns into Wasp and Widow, then another slow-mo happens. Then he turns into Shogun and then Titan. I don't know what exactly would he be doing, but probably like the most iconic attacks from all of them: (Like Lynx turning invisible, Hermit using magic, Shogun using his long and short katana and Titan using his hook hand.)

Fatality:

1. Melting - Shadow would go inside opponent's body and he would slowly melt their skin and meat. Opponent's scream would eventually turn into Shadow's laughing and then he would turn into demonic version of the opponent.
2. Not Sure...

Intros:

1. At The Top (Shadow would walk through a bunch of people who are cheering his name. Then he eliminates them all.)
2. Champion (Shadow walks to opponent as two ninjas attack him. He takes their weapon and slices their heads as nothing happened.)
3. More Of Power (Shadow walks with Titan's body, but headless. Then he steals energy from that body until it turns into nothing but meat and bones.)
4. Gates Of Shadows (It starts with Gates of Shadows opening. Shadow walks out of it and jumps into a portal that leads him to the battle.)

Outros:

1. Evil Laugh (Shadow kicks opponent while he/she's already down. Then he sends them both to hell. And as Shadow starts laughing you can see in the background Volcano, Megalith and Fungus cheering him.)
2. The Only One (Shadow looks at the camera and starts saying that he's the only worthy one. After that he punches the camera and it starts flichering.)
3. Full Power (Shadow takes opponent by their neck and then starts to laugh while he's holding them. He spawns a portal and throws them into that portal. A bunch of ninjas look at the opponent and they start fighting him/her.)
4. See You In Hell (Shadow grabs opponent neck once again. Everything around them starts to burn. He's insulting opponent and then throws them away from them. Camera just shows their silhouette representing SF2 estethic. Shadow pulls out a sword and lighting fast goes through opponent. Opponent starts creaming and then they just fall on the floor. Shadow is putting his katana into his basket in really epic samurai style)

"[M4F] I’m on the hunt for a woman who’d be interested in crafting a long term celebrity story. This won’t be sunshines and rainbows all the time. We may have disagreements, we may fight, but when push comes to shove we’ll always find our way back to each other.","Hi there, thank you for taking an interest. No matter how late you think you are, send something. All, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, **all** messages earn a response. Comments, questions, other ideas, anything is welcome. I know this is a lot but please don't feel pressured to match as much as I have.

An odd way to begin but I’d rather not waste time getting your hopes up only to realize we won’t mesh at all. If you’re looking to be treated like a Thai two cent crack whore dumpster fire, this won’t work out. I will not abuse you. I will not hit you. My arm won’t find its way up your pussy or ass. Bathroom business is one hundred percent out of the question. Incest is out of the question. Taboo in general makes me uncomfortable so I hope you can respect that. I am not poo pooing your kinks, be into whatever you want. **Now with that being said** if you yourself want that to happen to your character, by all means please do just know that I won’t. That would make an interesting plot point if we come to that arrangement. I walk into your trailer on set to surprise you and there you are getting railed by your brother?! Words will be had. I’m rambling, gonna stop now. 

Thank you for giving this a chance and a hopeful read through. Let's get to it shall we? None of the ideas or suggestions below are *we HAVE to do this this and this or I’m bored*. Suggestions, that’s all. Something that I think I should say right away is we don’t have to hit everything beat by beat or even stick to their career path. Should someone else have been WW? Black Widow? Maybe it’s Margot Robbie in True Detective and not Alexandra Daddario?

If my title isn't obvious enough I want us to create a living, breathing world full of people, places, and scenarios we overcome as a couple. Best friends, toxic friends, family members, coworkers, the fappening, #MeToo, a rape, a break in, and so on and so forth. If you'd like me to play someone of your own creation I'll happily do that, it's only fair that I be someone you desire as well.

When it comes to our starlet in question, please play them pretty close personality wise with some altercations if that interests you. Gal Gadot isn't going to be a bitch but maybe smokes, swears like a sailor, and has D's. Emma Watson isn't going to put out the first date, but is known to be a huge flirt. Jennifer Lawrence won't call me a cock out of nowhere. Scratch that, she totally would. An attitude is welcome of course but don't be a pain in the ass for the sake of being a pain in the ass. Yell at your manager for not getting you into the room for an audition, not me. I get called a useless asshole in my normal life, why would I want that here too 🤷🏻‍♀️? *Squeal little piggy man child!* N-no. Maybe that's something we work with together. ""Babe, it's just your Wendy’s order, they're not engraving your Oscar.""

Sexy time, let's talk about it. Should we tell each other our kinks now or learn about each other throughout our time together? Maybe one day we're going at it and out of nowhere you say *Pull my fucking hair daddy!... Get the zip ties baby.... Call me your fucking cock slave!.... Can I put my finger in your butt?* It doesn't have to be during sex of course, this can be something you bring up one day out of nowhere. Fantasizing about a threesome with a girlfriend of yours? Been wanting to watch me fuck one of your friends? One of my friends? Some ideas will be welcome, some won't. This could become a jealousy/cheating angle if we go down that road.

In bold are who I'm leaning towards but all are up for play time. Someone missing? Feel free to ask or suggest:

Celebrities, pornstars, wrestlers, internet personalities: Adriana Lima, Adrianne Palicki, AJ Lee, Alektra Blue, **Alexa Bliss (WWE), Alexandra Daddario**, Alice Eve, Alicia Vikander, **Alison Brie, Alison Haislip**, Allie (AEW), Allison Parker, Amanda Seyfried, **Amber Heard**, Amy Adams, **Angelina Jolie, Anna Kendrick, Anne Hathaway**, Anya Taylor-Joy, **April O'Neil, Asa Akira**, Aubrey Plaza, Ayumi Anime, Bella Thorne, **Blake Lively, Brie Larson**, Britney Spears, **Brooke Adams (Miss Tessmacher)**, Bryce Dallas Howard, **Caity Lotz**, Carice Van Houten, **Carrie Underwood**, Carter Cruise, Charlize Theron, **Chloe Bennet**, Christian Serratos, Christina Hendricks, **Daisy Ridley, Dakota Johnson, Deborah Ann Woll, Elizabeth Olsen, Emilia Clarke, Emily Bett Rickards, Emily Blunt**, Emma Dumont, Emma Stone, Emmy Rossum, Esperanza Gomez, Eva Green, **Eva Lovia**, Farrah Abraham, **Gabbie Hanna, Gal Gadot, Hailee Steinfeld, Hayden Paneteirre, Hayley Atwell**, Jaimie Alexander, Jamie Chung, Janina Gavanker, Jasmine Jae, Jenna Marbles, **Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Alba**, Jessica Biel, **Jessica Chastain, Karen Gillan**, Kate Beckinsale, Kate Mara, Kate Upton, **Katie Cassidy, Katrina Law**, Katy Perry, Kelly Kelly, **Kelsi Monroe, Kendra Sunderland**, Kristen Bell, **Lady Gaga, Lana (WWE), Lana Rhoades**, Lauren Cohan, Lea Michele, Lena The Plug, Lily James, Lindsay Lohan, Lizzy Caplan, Madison Ivy, Malin Akerman, **Mandy Moore, Margot Robbie, Maria Kanellis (WWE)**, Marisa Tomei, McKayla Maroney, **Megan Fox, Melissa Benoist, Mia Malkova**, Michelle Jenneke, Mickie James (WWE), Milana Vayntrub, Monica Bellucci, Naomi Scott, Natalie Alyn Lind, Natalie Dormer, Natalie Portman, Nathalie Emmanuel, Nicole Aniston, Nicole Scherzinger, Noelle Foley (Mick Foley's daughter), **Olivia Munn**, Oona Chaplin, **Paige (WWE), Peyton Royce (WWE)**, Rachel Brosnahan, Rachel McAdams, Reese Witherspoon, Ronda Rousey, Rose Byrne, Salma Hayek, **Sara Jean Underwood, Scarlett Bordeaux, Scarlett Johansson, Shakira**, Shantel VanSanten, Sophie Turner, Stacy Keibler (WWE), Summer Rae (WWE), Tatiana Maslany, Taynara Conti (WWE), Tenille Dashwood (WWE), Toni Storm, Torrie Wilson (WWE), Whitney Cummings. **ALL WOMEN AND CHARACTERS WILL BE 18+**

I’m very, **very** aware this post is quite vague but I’d rather give you options to play, not hogtie you down to one idea. 

Below I have some questions for you that I’d like answered. Feel free to ramble as long as you want. What’s most important is I want to know about you so if you decide *Fuck your questions I know how to introduce myself*, go for it:

1. Whom would you like to play as? Can’t nail down one celeb? Give me your top ten and we’ll go from there. Have your heart set on one name? Put her name in the title. Do you even have setups for people ready to go? Show me, I'd love to see and discuss.

2. When do you envision our story taking place? Very beginning, at your peak, or somewhere in the middle? Have we been dating or married for some time? If we're already dating I'd like to chit chat a bit about that, come up with some references so we have stuff to call back to. *Remember, remember when I fell into the pool?.... Wanna, take the limo around the corner like we did that one time?* And so on and so forth.

3. Who am I to you if not a complete stranger? Friend of a friend, blind date, neighbors, etc. Hell, am I about to get married and you're the one that stands up?

4. Kinks now or kinks in RP? If now, tell me yours.

5. PM’s here, Kik, or Discord?

6. Any movies lately? What’d you see?

7. How do you envision me? Shredded with a horse cock? Do I have a dad bod with an average dick who should be thankful he’s funny?  Am I a beautiful busty brunette or do I need a makeover at some point? What’s my job?

So what do you say? Let's get to brainstorming. If you've read this and have a setup you've been dying to get off the ground, lay it on me.",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fhnell/m4f_im_on_the_hunt_for_a_woman_whod_be_interested/,,Ricklaneng,fhnell,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fhnell/m4f_im_on_the_hunt_for_a_woman_whod_be_interested/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fhnell/m4f_im_on_the_hunt_for_a_woman_whod_be_interested/,0,2020-03-12
"Look, I'm hype for Black Widow. But we have to mentally prepare for anything that could happen in regards to the movie due to the virus. (Please read before jumping to conclusions). Stay vigilant!","I'm fucking hype for Black Widow just as much as any person on this sub is.

I'm so ready I still have my money to the side for my IMAX ticket with the Black Widow combos. Hell, I already have money to see it twice if I need to. I'm literally waiting for those tickets to go on sale so I can stare at them for the next few months like I do will all MCU movies lol.

However, I do think we need to mentally prepare for anything that comes our way. And sadly, the movie industry may be the next main thing to become affected by COVID-19.

No Time to Die already got pushed back, Mulan is delayed in China, and there's talks that other movies planned to come out over the next few months may possibly delay. And just under an hour ago, the NBA suspended it's season, Tom Hanks and his wife tested positive, and Trump is no longer allowing travel from Europe the next 30 days. There's more going on, but those are some of the main things.

Based off that stuff alone, we have to prepare folks. I'm not saying to immediately get worked up and be either overly confident it WONT be delayed, or overly confident it WILL be delayed. I'm saying stay AWARE that there's a POSSIBILITY for anything at this point.

And I know many people are going to be upset at what I said, but I'm sorry folks, we live in reality and we have to face it.

You can still be hype for the movie as any fan should be, but just prepare for anything to happen at this point in time.

I'm not going to flesh out what COULD happen and what WONT happen, but just stay aware of the situation and how fast its spreading, regardless of what your opinions are.

It doesn't matter what you think or feel should happen, nothing is off the table at this point.

To end this post, I wanted to give a few possibilities if something does happen:

\- Delaying the movie as a whole

\- Releasing the movie but canceling press events, that includes press screenings

\- Release the movie and tell theaters to take precaution

\- Reduce the amount of screenings at each theater to prevent the virus from spreading

\- Not do anything and continue everything as normal and tell people to be cautious and practice proper hygiene so we can see Black Widow kick Taskmasters ass like every person on this sub wants :)

"Cosmic Chaos [Doctor Doom (God Emperor), Ant-Man, Quicksilver, Bullseye (Dark Avengers)]"," 

**This event has a higher difficulty level than many of the other events, so you may want to drop down and SCL or two. If you drop down for Simulator or Hearts of Darkness, you should think about doing so here as well.**

This is a 4-day event with four 24-hour subs. The nodes are about 70% tile-movers/30% goons. You have SHIELD goons in sub one, Mindless Ones in sub two, Brotherhood Mutants in sub three, and symbiotes in sub four. Tile-movers are Avengers and Defenders in sub one, animal-themed in sub two, X-Persons in sub three, and Galactic characters (plus IM, Rhodey, and DP) in sub four.   
**WARNING:** sub two has a difficulty and slowness spike; 4\* Rocket &amp; Groot, Kitty Pryde, and The Thing are a brutal team for lower rosters that are trying to punch upwards and the Mindless Ones slow everything down, as always. The 5\* node in SCL7+ can also be tricky as 5\* Hawkeye can fortify the Mindless One’s green Eye Beam tiles and OML will cough up strike tiles when the Mindless One spams countdowns. Plan for significantly longer clear times if you’re playing optimally. 

The Join Forces nodes are one-time nodes with Captain Marvel required on the main page and the boosted characters on the sub-event pages. Wave nodes are present for T2 in each sub and there are no T3 nodes. Wave nodes are 2x3 and have one wave of goons and one wave of tile-movers. A boss node opens after you clear H3 with boss versions of existing characters (Iron Man, Devil Dino, Mean Jean, and Talos). A blue Ant-Man cover is available as a progression reward in SCL7+ as well as various amounts of shards for him starting at SCL4. 

**Featured Characters:**

* 5-Star: Doctor Doom (God Emperor)
* 4-Star: Ant-Man
* 3-Star: Quicksilver
* 2-Star: Bullseye (Dark Avengers

**Weekly Buffs:**

* 4-Star: Domino, Jean Grey (All-New X-Men), Miles Morales, Sabretooth, Spider-Man (Infinity War)

Here's the good Disney thread so you don't have to read the shitty ones 🐭,"First of all, will the autists who are saying that people will stay home because of coronavirus and watch Disney+ all day, which will somehow help DIS, pour themselves a warm glass of shut the hell up and drink some of it?  The ultimate DIS thesis is below.

**Streaming**

Disney has 30 million Disney+ subscribers and 30 million Hulu subscribers.  Based on those numbers, the revenue from streaming is $3.6 billion a year (out of Disney's $59 billion total revenue).  The profit is, however, much smaller.  The Mandalorian costs $15 million per episode to make, while The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, WandaVision and Hawkeye will run close to $25 million per episode.  All in all, the budget for making content for Disney+ is approximately $1 billion for 2020 alone.  Also subtract from 2020 revenue all the royalties they have lost by taking ALL their content off Netflix and other networks.

They have also spent billions on infrastructure and promotion of Disney+, so the best they were hoping for in 2020 was break even or maybe come in $0.5-1B ahead, which again, is very small.

Bottom line on streaming: it's tiny to their bottom line and is more of a liability than an asset when other divisions are crashing.

[Disney is Spending a Ton of Money on Disney+, Including an Almost $1 Billion Original Content Budget](https://www.slashfilm.com/disney-plus-costs/)

**Network TV**

It's a bad year for sports, and ESPN will suffer greatly.  Because of the broad decline in the economy, advertising budgets of ALL companies will shrink, and ABC will also suffer greatly.


**Box office**

MGM recently moved 007 to November, but the assholes at Disney are pretending like Black Widow (due May 1) is not going to be moved.  Jesus Christ, of course it is.  New York is going to be on lockdown in a few days as will many other places.  There will be no fucking movie watching this spring.  They spent $200 million making Black Widow and expected it to make a billion.  That's a billion they are not going to have now.  But that's only part of the problem with Black Widow, the official launch of MCU Phase 4.

Black Widow is not 007, and Marvel is not MGM.  Marvel has no flexibility to move Black Widow because of the way they plan their lineup.  Moving Black Widow to November severely fucks with their budget and timeline for the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Everything was riding on it, and they will now have to move releases AND production of upcoming MCU movies with established schedules out to 2021 and 2022.  That completely fucks their projected box office for those years.  It also fucks up their Disney+ lineup and affects production in streaming.  And merchandise.  And a ton of other shit.

Mulan?  They fucking canceled it in Asia.  The movie they made for Asia.  Canceled in Asia.

[Marvel Will Struggle To Delay Movies Because Of Coronavirus](https://screenrant.com/marvel-black-widow-coronavirus-no-delay-problem-reason/)

**Parks**

I am just going to save myself the energy and not bother writing about these retarded places where fat kids stuff their faces with ice cream and get fondled by characters, or vice versa.  The parks will be closed.  Paris, Orlando, and Anaheim. 
 The cruises will be closed.

*Target price*

Yes, it has already dropped by a lot.  So fucking what, idiots?  Stop repeating the same dumb shit over and over.  DIS was $98 less than a year ago and $92 in 2016, and that was without a pandemic that cancelled their biggest movies and closed all their parks, and there was no massive recession.

Even without closed parks and canceled movies, they already hit a $100.40 low in pre-market trading.  The 100p guys are practically in the money, but I don't care because I'm no 100p March 20 retard, no sir (more on that below).  

Without the parks closed and Black Widow cancelled, DIS already has already been dropping 1-1.5 percent more than total SPY drop on the bad days.  It's like the more extreme, crackhead version of SPY that's going down quickly.  Futures are currently down a full 5%, which means DIS will be firmly under $100 today, and that will lay down the groundwork for big, juicy drops for my April puts.

Specifically, I anticipate a $15 drop when the parks are closed and another $5-10 drop when Black Widow is cancelled.  I expect further drops as TV talking heads start spending time talking about how Disney is dropping and how no one would have expected that 6 months ago.  Jim Cramer will go from ""Buy Disney, it's cheap"" to ""Wow, I actually think that Disney is not going to do too well in the next two years.""  That will tip boomer over the edge, and his weak hands will lead him to selling what he will have left of DIS at that time.

TL;DR My Apr 17 $75 puts will be firmly in the money when all is said and done.  

Bonus: I have made a chart of how the various tendies will print, depending on how far DIS drops.  Because each strike has its own IV, the outcomes are different.  I believe there is room for a drop to $50 and thus maximized the number of contracts.  But in any scenario, it will print.  The prices are still OK last time I checked despite the obviously high IV.

https://i.imgur.com/LUrl0cQ.png

Yes, I know DIS will not go bankrupt, the $0.01 column is just for fun

Note that these tendies do not include any time value.  If the events described above (parks, movies) happen in March, you will also be paid a cumload in premiums for your in-the-money puts that boomer's broker will be buying to hedge his long positions.

**Positions**

123 contracts total, most with TDA and some with Robinhood, just because I want to experience the thrill of my orders failing again.

https://i.imgur.com/MkiUd2I.png

You can call this a YOLO play but to me it's a common-sense play, to bet against a company that makes money on movies, parks, cruises, and hotels in a year when there will be no movies, parks, cruises or hotels.

P. S. I do enjoy Disney animated movies and the Marvel movies even though they are cheesy as shit, but my overall feelings towards Disney as a company are overwhelmingly negative for making mockery of the copyright clause of the U.S. constitution and ruining copyright law for the entire 20th century by lobbying the fuck out of Congress to extend copyright terms until they became utterly ridiculous, which didn't stop the U.S. from pressuring the rest of the world to adopt them via mandatory WIPO membership for pretty much all countries.  I am looking forward to the tendies but I would not at all be upset if Disney got severely punished for being a completely amoral company and making so many asshole practices an industry norm.

I wouldn't be surprised if they cancel the World Premiere of Black Widow due to Coronavirus,"People are panicking about Coronavirus and they buy all toilet papers at every store to ""protect"" themselves from the disease. Not to mention that every major events including E3 2020 are cancelled because of that. (Sorry guys but no E3 this year)

Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if they cancel the World Premiere of Black Widow because of Coronavirus and Marvel usually do the world premiere stuff like what they did with other films like Ragnarok, Black Panther, Endgame etc.

So I don't expect for the film to have a world premiere because Coronavirus.

To clarify it, I am *NOT* talking about the film's release date, I am talking the one where they held red carpet for the film and have actors being interviewed by same old people who do same for the world premiere of any Disney Star Wars movies.",marvelstudios,0,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fh740g/i_wouldnt_be_surprised_if_they_cancel_the_world/,Discussion,Vin13ish,fh740g,/r/marvelstudios/comments/fh740g/i_wouldnt_be_surprised_if_they_cancel_the_world/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fh740g/i_wouldnt_be_surprised_if_they_cancel_the_world/,6,2020-03-12

[Futa4F/Futa] Celeb or Rule 34 futa pairings,"Hi, I am looking for partners that are interested in a Rule 34 futa x futa play. The universes that I am familiar with are listed below, but if you like any other, please tell me what they are. If I know it well enough, we can set up something in that universe too. Random celeb futa pairings are also welcome from the below list, though R34 responders will grab attention first.

**Settings:**

*Rule 34 pairings:* Not listing any particular scenes here as it is very universe dependent. Can discuss in PMs once we settle on a suitable universe and a pairing from that universe.

*Celeb futa pairings:*

**1**. A chance meeting at an outdoor event - music concerts, ball games, self-expression events like the Burning Man etc - could be a likely starting point too.

**2**. A spilling over of romance where our characters in a show are playing particularly close friends or romantic interests. It can be as simple as an after the take scene where one is unable to hold back any longer and asks the other out. This can be appropriately reduced into a one-off scene or a long-term option based on discussion in PMs.

**3**. Both of us are in town for a convention/movie premiere and are booked next to each other in the same hotel. Accidental run-in in the corridors anywhere within the hotel leads to the discovery of each other's secret, either simultaneously (for instance, at the pool) or otherwise.

**4**. Costume party where everybody is wearing one of those fancy eye masks that do not fully conceal the identity. It is supposed to be a secretive club of sorts in a mansion. Think of something similar to the scenes from Eyes Wide Shut. When you recognize who I am, you decide to make an approach and see if the night will work out.

***

**Writing Style**: First or third person with a strong preference for 10+ to 15 lines. ***Open to short and long term. For long term, we can discuss the pairings and the setting in detail in PMs,*** whether or not it starts with one of the cliched starts above. Preferred medium is Reddit PMs only. 

***

*CW DC:* Iris West, Caitlin Snow, Patty Spivot, Nora West-Allen, Cecile Horton, Gypsy, Jesse Quick, Laurel Lance, Sara Lance, Ava, Amaya, Zari Tomaz, Nora Darhk, Thea Queen, Felicity Smoak, Mia Smoak, Kara Zor-El, Lena Luthor

*Netflix Marvel:* Karen Page, Jessica Jones, Rachael Taylor, Elektra, Vanessa Fisk, Claire Temple, Misty Knight, Colleen Wing, Bobbi Morse, Melinda May, Daisy Johnson, Jemma Simmons, Jiaying, Peggy Carter, Angie Martinelli, Dottie Underwood

*MCU:* Black Widow, Wasp, Gamora, Nebula, Pepper Potts, Valkyrie, Captain Marvel, Hela, Aunt May, Shuri, Mantis, Scarlet Witch, Jane Foster, Darcy Lewis, Maria Hill, Lady Sif, Christine Palmer, Sharon Carter, Okoye - X-Men: Jean Grey, Storm, Raven, Psylocke

*Game of Thrones:* Sansa, Arya, Cersei, Margaery, Daenerys, Missandei, Ygritte, Melisandre, Shae, Ros, Ellaria Sand

*Celebs*: We can play any of the celebs that played the characters above too, though it is a second preference. Olivia Wilde, Carla Gugino, Jennifer Aniston, Salma Hayek, Elizabeth Debicki, Aubrey Plaza, Katheryn Winnick, Kaley Cuoco, Melissa Rauch are a few more names to throw in there if you want celebs only play.

***

Pick your scene, your preferred characters/celeb(s), your kinks and limits and write out a nice message please. Also let me know if you are interested in a futadom-futasub relationship or a switching relationship. Kinks include size comparison, premature ejaculations, CFNF(futa), ENF(futa), excessive cum, cum play, playful name calling, teasing, anal, blowjobs, romance, switches etc. Death, vore, unrealistic body parts, transformation, bimbofication, sissification, feminization and toilet play are hard 'no's. No low effort messages please. All characters will be aged up to 18+ where required in the universes.",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fhqhsi/futa4ffuta_celeb_or_rule_34_futa_pairings/,,futamanda,fhqhsi,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fhqhsi/futa4ffuta_celeb_or_rule_34_futa_pairings/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fhqhsi/futa4ffuta_celeb_or_rule_34_futa_pairings/,0,2020-03-13

A mechanical keyboard noob reviews the Razer Huntsman Elite,"**Prefix -**

I’ll prefix this post with the fact that I haven't had the best of luck with Razer in the past. I bought both versions of the Raiju Tournament Edition for the PS4 and both of them were plagued with stick drift out of the box! I tried so hard to love that pad, the extra button placements were perfect and I've always preferred the Xbox style stick layout. Unfortunately it just wasn't meant to be.

But I didn't let this effect my decision when I was shopping for a new keyboard (although I will admit I probably should have).

**Why? -**

Although getting this keyboard was an impulse buy, I did need a new keyboard...honest.  
After just over a year, my trusty Logitech G613 started ‘chattering’. I was devastated, I hadn't even changed the batteries in the damn thing! Its battery life outlasted its actual life. Now before you sit there and say ‘OMG NOOB JUST CLEAN IT’ or ‘YEAH BUT WINDOWS CAN FIX THAT’. I did and no it can't. Compressed air and alcohol only fix dirt and bounce keys is bullshit. This was a fault with the keyboard itself.

**The P’s &amp; C’s -**

***Pros:***

* Holy fuck, this thing is great to type on. I’m sure there are people out there that own good keyboards who know this, but for the rest of you. There's a reason these keyboards cost so damn much.
* Opto mechanical switches. Because why should audio have all the high fidelity fun. Coming from the Romer-G’s on the G613, these things are on another level. Like, I can't, even.
* The multimedia keys. The G613 does have some, but being able to change the volume with the wheel is a god send. Need to mute? It can do that. Want to skip or go back to the previous track that was playing, well guess what it has buttons for that too.
* Razer Synapse. There are so many customisation options, colleges should start offering classes on how to use it. It’s integration with games, third party peripherals and other apps is madness.
* That wrist rest though. I thought the G613 rest was amazing, until my wrists had the pleasure of resting on the one that comes with the Huntsman Elite. Plus if you don't want it, or need some extra desk space, it’s easily detachable thanks to its magnetic connection.

***Cons:***

* It’s hella expensive. This thing retails at £199.99, you could buy a current gen console at that price.
* Razer Synapse. I know I have this in the Pro’s list but honestly, it's a steep learning curve. I had to download an external Chroma Studio profile to make it look like it does on the box.
* Clickety, clackety keys. I know a lot of people love the way mechanical keyboards sound and I might be in a minority here. BUT why did Razer have to make this thing so goddamn loud.
* It’s wired. I think it's about time Razer started catering for the wireless market. Not everyone wants the fancy lights but do want a high quality keyboard.

**Final Thoughts -**

If you're in the market for a new keyboard and want it to have all the latest and greatest features, then look no further. I never thought I’d say this about a keyboard, I love it.

The asking price is a bit much and the keys are a little bit loud for my liking, but I don't think it gets much better than this. The Razer Huntsman Elite is at the top of it’s class with features no other company can rival right now.

If, however you're just looking for a good keyboard that doesn't break the bank. Then maybe you should look at Razer’s Black Widow or SteelSeries’s Apex range.",razer,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/fi4d0q/a_mechanical_keyboard_noob_reviews_the_razer/,Discussion,concrete_moose,fi4d0q,/r/razer/comments/fi4d0q/a_mechanical_keyboard_noob_reviews_the_razer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/razer/comments/fi4d0q/a_mechanical_keyboard_noob_reviews_the_razer/,3,2020-03-13
[Futa4Futa] Marvel/DC Supersluts just want to suck and fuck!,"Batgirl sucks off Harley Quinn after a rooftop chase.

Gamora bonds with Nebula by bending over and taking her sister's cock in her ass.

While the boys are playing video games, Raven and Starfire 69 in Starfire's room.

Sick of Captain Marvel's attitude, Scarlett Witch uses her powers to humble the hero a bit... by making her desperate for Wanda's cock.

Wonder Woman, Supergirl, and Power Girl should really leave the Watchtower but... Diana can't get enough of being spitroasted by the two.

Black Widow infiltrates Wakanda only to be caught and double teamed by Okoye and Shuri.

So yeah, basically title. I'd like to write about some slutty Marvel or DC ladies who are more interested in sucking cock and getting fucked than anything else. Maybe everyone's just significantly sluttier in this reality, maybe some villain's plan made everyone into a huge slut, whatever the case may be. I'd love to do multiple scenes or something too, if you're interested in a longer term RP.

As far as what characters to play, I am open! Let me know your favorites!

I RP in 3rd person. I would like you to do the same.

As far as limits, it's the usual. No toilet stuff, blood/gore/vore, death, beastiality, etc. No impreg, just not interested. Absolutely no ageplay/underage. Don't even mention it, I have no interest. All characters must be 18+.

If you're interested, please shoot me a message! In your message please let me know if you'd like to play DC or Marvel and what characters you'd most like to play, kinks you'd like to include and your limits, and that you're OK playing in 3rd person.",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fi8uj4/futa4futa_marveldc_supersluts_just_want_to_suck/,,allthefutanari,fi8uj4,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fi8uj4/futa4futa_marveldc_supersluts_just_want_to_suck/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fi8uj4/futa4futa_marveldc_supersluts_just_want_to_suck/,0,2020-03-13

Detailed RP and long-term,"As the world (mine at least) is preparing for staying in, I'm looking for new RPs. I'm a very very devoted writer, but I don't expect perfection or even first language English (mine isn't though I'm published in both). 

I write F main characters (any minor) as a rule and most of the time. I will for the right RP take on M/M or M/M/F. I always need a good plot, I don't go for the filth fest but real world logic. I also do not fade to black and aim for a pairing in each story. Darker themes are good but I like a non tragic end. I rp on Google docs, pms or Discord. Almost any genre, historical, scifi, modern (with an interesting premise not ""high school""). Canon or OCs. 

So, is it a freedom fighter's widow in a fate forsaken Slavic country deciding the dictator needs to die? 

Some 20's-50's mafia story?

Grown up Matilda figures Stansfield's still alive?

Older Ginny finds out Tom's diary?

Maybe, you never asked to be assigned a handmaid, but you are?

Or two post -apoc towns are fighting for control and I'm married to one of the leaders...

It is also your opportunity to play Hux or Kylo, I can write Rey or an OC.

Be over 18. Do not block me if I don't immediately reply.

Lazy writing from The Avengers 2012?,"This particular scene always rubbed me the wrong way, and it was the scene where Black Widow is interrogating Loki and she deduces his master plan from this:

Widow: ""You're a monster."" 

Loki: ""No. You brought the monster.""

 Widow: ""So, Banner. That's your play.""


How the hell did she come to that conclusion? How does Loki's reply reveal his plan to use the Hulk? For example, imagine this exchange:

Widow: ""You're the most egotistical creature I have ever met""

Loki: ""Oh no, you brought the huge ego."" (could be referring to HER own ego for example)

Widow: ""So.. Tony Stark, that's your play."" 

See what I mean? I wish they made it more believable that Loki slipped up by accident and not make the dialogue so vague. Similar to how Banner picking up the scepter without even knowing it, COULD'VE been a plot point but ultimately led nowhere. Most of the lazy writing was in the middle of the movie.",marvelstudios,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fhu0wz/lazy_writing_from_the_avengers_2012/,Discussion,Dulek_Zax_Chf,fhu0wz,/r/marvelstudios/comments/fhu0wz/lazy_writing_from_the_avengers_2012/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fhu0wz/lazy_writing_from_the_avengers_2012/,10,2020-03-13
[M4F/A] I'm craving a rule 34 harem,"**Disclaimer:** All characters *must* be played over the age of 18, regardless of their canon age. For instance, if we do Pokemon then trainers receive their license when they turn of age and every character who isn't canonically 18 will be aged up, for example if we use May, she'll be 18! The same applies to every Pokemon character who isn't already 18. The Naruto and Harry Potter casts are the older epilogue/post-epilogue counterparts(Thus they've graduated and have become of age). And for Marvel/DC, we'll be going with the comic counterparts. Meaning every DC/Marvel character is of age(As everyone I have listed is canonically 19-30). If I happen to be forgetting somebody, that person shall also be 18+. No exceptions!

Hello there, lately I've been wanting a rule 34 harem. It doesn't matter to me how many women are included, I know everyone has their limits after all. But please keep in mind I'm not asking you to play all the women at once, the others can sit in the background or put aside while shifting focus from one(or two) female(s) to the next. The most I'd ask for in one scene is two, but if you think you can manage three.... you're welcome to do so! Of course, we don't *need* threesomes. I'd just like a harem in some capacity! Frankly, I'll take what I can get! :)

Now I have many fandoms, and I have to admit... some I have notably less choices in than others. If you feel like playing a female from a fandom listed below but not mentioned, then feel free to ask and we can discuss it upon contact!

This would be a preference, not required, but we could have multiple females from various of the listed fandoms in the *same* universe! Like everyone just happens to be in the Pokemon universe thanks to Ultra Wormholes, or some super villain causes the Marvel/DC universes to become merged! Those are just examples, if you've got something better in mind to have multiple fandom characters in one place then I'd be happy to hear it!

Kinks:

Public sex, risky scenes, doggy style, cowgirl style, mating press, harems, milfs, impregnation, breeding, sub/dom(I'm a switch, but I prefer being dom), breast play, and a bunch of vanilla common kinks!

Limits:

Scat, yaoi, futa, foot stuff, orgasm denial

Now for the fandoms! I'll list the females I'm currently craving in bold. Though I'll have to admit, most are from Pokemon haha! And as a reminder, *all* characters must be aged 18+ if they aren't already! No exceptions!

Pokemon: **May, Dawn, Mallow, Lusamine,** Lillie, **Flannery, Sonia, Nessa,** Oleana, **Delia Ketchum, Amara/Sima/Kiawe's mom**, Malva, **Melony,** Bianca, **Cynthia**, Professor Juniper, Lorelei, **Misty's sisters, Grace,** Serena, Shauna, **Korrina, Sapphire, Platinum,** and various others! Don't see somebody listed, just ask! And this one's a long shot, but I'd like Giselle as well! She was a one off character from the original series!

Marvel: **Emma Frost, Rogue, Gwen Stacey**(Or Ghost Spider), **Black Cat,** Silk, Black Widow, Captain Marvel(Long hair please), **Enchantress**, Agent May, Skye, and others

DC: **Black Canary, Batgirl**(Barbara Gordon), **Supergirl, Harley Quinn, Jessica Cruz,** Poison Ivy, **Starfire, Blackfire** and various others. But those are the ones at the top of my list!

Harry Potter: **Hermione**, Luna, Bellatrix, Ginny, Fleur

Yugioh: **Alexis Rhodes**

Resident Evil: **Claire Redfield**

Disney: **Aunt Cass(Big Hero 6), Princess Jasmine, and Bonnie(Kim Possible)**

Sonic the Hedgehog: **Sally, Bunnie, Fiona, and Sally**

**Mad Moxxi**

Mass Effect: **Ashley, Miranda, Samantha Traynor**

Total Drama: **Lindsay**, **Courtney**, Bridgette

Fallout: Piper

Naruto: **Tsunade, Ino, Delta,** Sakura(long hair preferred)

**Princess Bubblegum**

**Frankie Foster**

**Daphne Blake** (I mean... can you blame me?)

Saints Row: **Shaundi**, **Viola**, **Luz**, **Tanya**, Asha

I think that just about does it for the fandoms.... if I managed to keep your interest until the end, then I thank you for reading and hope to see you in PMs! We can either do this here on Reddit, or on Discord! I'd prefer discussing things before jumping right to Discord though",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fi54es/m4fa_im_craving_a_rule_34_harem/,Long Term RP,shadowlarvitar,fi54es,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fi54es/m4fa_im_craving_a_rule_34_harem/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fi54es/m4fa_im_craving_a_rule_34_harem/,0,2020-03-13

Release Black Widow on Disney +,"If Disney was really smart, and a tad altruistic, they would release Black Widow on Disney + and postpone the theatrical run like they did with other films. Charge the sub +$9.99 to rent the movie and donate a large portion of the proceeds to help those disaffected, either theater workers and owners or directly to coronavirus afflicted somehow. 

They would build up a ton of good will, rake in a ton of new subscriptions, and add new content that they sorely need. They've been struggling with content and subscriptions since the roll out. Most analysts suggest that there has been too much of  dry spell.

I know this sounds crazy to some, but it's really not. May 1 isn't going to be better for COVID-19, it's going to be much worse. You'll have a captive audience of many people self isolating. Further, It's a luxury, so only people who can afford to pay it will be. (or should be) 

They can then release the movie in theaters at a later date. I bet it will still have a stellar run and then they can sell it on bluray or whatever distribution platform they need. It seems like a no brainer to me. I'm not sure what deals they have in place with theaters that would thwart this, but I'm guessing it could be worked out if they can just pull movies at any time.",movies,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fhyh9r/release_black_widow_on_disney/,,RoShamPoe,fhyh9r,/r/movies/comments/fhyh9r/release_black_widow_on_disney/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fhyh9r/release_black_widow_on_disney/,19,2020-03-13

5 new Black Widow 2020 Posters,"Disney and Marvel Studios today have [five new promo posters](https://loudlabs.nl/5-new-black-widow-2020-posters/) online from superhero thriller Black Widow. The posters feature not only Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), but also Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Red Guardian (David Harbor) and the mysterious villain Taskmaster. You can of course view the posters below.

In the action movie from Marvel Studios, we see how Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, must confront the dark aspects of her past when a dangerous plot unfolds. Romanoff, meanwhile, is chased by a villain who does everything to make her a little smaller.

Black Widow is directed by Cate Shortland. In addition to the aforementioned actors, there are also roles in the film for O-T Fagbenle (as Mason), Rachel Weisz (as Melina Vostokoff / Iron Maiden), Ray Winstone and Olivier Richters.

Black Widow should reach theaters on April 29, but that could easily be changed in the short term, given the developments surrounding the corona virus.

I'd love to set up a scene either with one (or More) characters from a show or movie. And really see if they're into the naughty things I've always imagined of them..

Or, their actress counterparts. Maybe a chance encounter with a fan. A filthy rendezvous with another Actor or crew member.  A contest, or an auction.

[Gloria](https://i.imgur.com/6T1u5FU.jpg) (Modern Family) So fucking amazingly hot. that accent, those curves, those fucking tits. You know she's nasty and freaky in bed. Willing to do anything to please the man she's with. She loves attention, and always knows that men are staring and drooling. She eats it up.

[Jackie](https://i.imgur.com/a7H40Qu.jpg) (That 70's Show) She's so spoiled. So sexy. So petite. Her parents paid for everything she wanted. But you know she had a few different Sugar Daddies on the side. And I bet she treats them extra special. And lets them do anything they want to her.

[Rachel](http://i.imgur.com/7SMEc.jpg) (Friends)  I mean, good lord. It must have been perpetually cold in that apartment. Her nipples were the real star of that show. Or maybe. She got a thrill knowing that people were looking. Maybe it got her a little wet if she caught one of her co-stars, or one of the crew looking at those perfect, perky tits.

[Sweet Dee](https://i.redd.it/7kdgxg8wxb9y.jpg) (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) ""Dee, you gangly, uncoordinated bitch!"" ""You look like a Holocaust victim in pageant make-up."" Sweet Dee gets shit on and fucked with so consistently, she's become completely self loathing and destructive. Now any time a guy even smiles at her she's ready to let him have all of her holes for as long as he wants, as rough as he wants. The dumb bitch.

If this is something that interests you, please send me a message. You could play as one or more of them, or just chat about them.

Kinks are: Anal/Assplay, rough fucking, choking/slapping/filthy name calling, MFF threesomes, tit fucking, age gaps, size difference, wet/sloppy blowjobs/deepthroat, drugs/drinking, cheating/getting caught.

what do you think the chances of a merc RG/ Solider/Sniper/LT rework are? it would appear they need one more toon to make a team of 5? so kind of like an insert leader role like fury to shield and red skull to hydra.

Right now, we've got a strong alliance in Michele and Parv, and another in Sophie and Sarah. I also think if Kim can make the merge, with these four women in play, she'd join up with Parv. It seems like Denise and Kim are forming into our third pair...So what are the chances that all six women could team together?

Suggested Avengers Reworks: Making Earths Heroes Mighty.,"Earths Mightiest Heroes have been a lot less mighty since Foxnext decided to start introducing team synergies and pushed almost all of the original Avengers out of the meta. Captain America and Black Widow used to be some of the most prevalent characters in my Arena shard until the Defenders were buffed up to where they are now. (And now we’ve had even more teams added that have surpassed them too.)

I’m creating this post to take a look at the current characters that possess the Avengers tag and hopefully make a few suggestions that could be implemented to make them a bit more powerful than they are today. 

With the introduction of a ton of new characters and team synergies, we’ve seen most of the Avengers pack their bags and find employment on other teams. 

Iron Man, War Machine, Vision, and Falcon are all chilling together on the Power Armor team and since Rescue takes that team from a good burst team to an amazing one, we aren’t going to see her get replaced by someone like Cap even if the team is missing a tank. (Note: Vision may be returning to the Avengers like the prodigal son after Ironheart gets released). 

Scarlett Witch and Thor have found new homes in both the Supernatural and Asguardian teams. (But lets be honest, not many were using Thor to begin with before his buff as his slow speed made him easy to deal with and hard to rely on for damage and his hammer throw was unreliable to chain to even one target). 

Nick Fury and Coulson are both on SHIELD teams, and rightfully so. Black Panther is with the Wakandans and even if you don’t have them leveled up, Panther would be more comfortable on a Hero Brawlers team before being on an Avengers team. 

This leaves us with Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk, and Ant-Man (lol). Not exactly a super synergistic team. I personally have replaced Ant-Man with Quake since her passive is basically his Ult but with no cooldown and more damage. But with the addition of the Inhumans, Quake is warming up to leave and join Blackbolt and the others (as soon as we all farm those damn Asguardians and actually unlock him). 

So why do they suck so much in the current meta?  Individually, most of them are very good characters. Cap has an amazing taunt that can be used often and gives the whole team energy and even more to Avenger allies and grants everyone defense up. He can also gain defense up from his basic and has a high block chance with more Avenger allies. Widow can stun and bleed an entire team and steel all the buffs off a target if she’s stealthed and is one of the fastest characters in the game with speed up for her whole team. Hawkeye can clear all buffs from 3 characters and can blind an entire team. Hulk basically becomes a nuke if he drops below half health and has his ultimate ready and will continue to hit pretty hard while below half health. Each of these characters seem good (except Ant-Man. He just sucks with his wet noodle damage). So why are they never used outside against any meta teams?  

Because they have little to no synergy. 

Widow can cleanse her Avenger allies of exactly ONE debuff if you take her second ability to level 6 (and considering other abilities in the game have much better upgrades, you’re better off putting the mats elsewhere). Cap gains more block chance per Avenger ally and has synergy with Iron Man giving him bonus damage on his second ability. But Iron Man left Cap for War Machine. Hulk gains counter attack if he has a Wave I Avenger ally (really?  That’s it?). That’s barely any synergy and these are all more just gimmicks than anything else. Ant-Man has more synergy with Wasp and Hawkeye has no synergy with anyone. Not like it matters since he just gets one shotted anyway thanks to his super low health pool. 

So let’s look at a way to possibly improve these characters and take them to the next level. 

Let me preface these ideas by saying that I have both a 6 red star Cap and Widow and a 4 red star Hawkeye and Hulk. All at least with tier 3 maxed abilities and G11.  That being said, they are just BARELY competitive in Blitz against top tier teams and that’s solely because of red stars. They have a ton of bad match up that once I get to higher blitz tiers, I have to choose my battles with them extremely carefully or risk losing. Meanwhile I can go against just about anything with my X-Men team and laugh while Phoenix eats them alive. 

Here are my suggested buffs and synergies:

Captain America:

Basic: Attack enemy for X damage and gain defense up and counter attack. Apply defense up to all Avenger allies. 50% chance to chain to 2 additional targets. +50% chance to chain if Black Widow is an ally. 

-This will make his basics a bit better as he will gain counter attack and give defense up to his other allies. As most of the rest of the Avengers are squishy, this will help their survivability when Hulk and Cap aren’t taunting. It will also grant some synergy with Black Widow. 

Special: Apply defense up to all allies. Avenger allies gain defense up for 2 turns. Gain taunt. While taunting, gain 1000% resistance. Grant 4 ability energy to random allies, grant 2 additional energy to Avenger allies. 

-The problem with Caps taunt is it’s very easy to clear and then you’re free to pick off the rest of his team with minimal effort. This would give him more resistance to cleanse and would give defense up to Avenger allies for a longer duration. It sucks to have Hawkeye take a turn after Cap taunts and then get obliterated by AoE. 

Ultimate: Throw Shield for X damage, clearing all buffs from primary target and chain to 2 additional targets clearing 3 buffs from each. Gain +50% damage and focus for each Avenger ally. If Winter Soldier is an ally, he catches the Shield and throws it back, hitting the same primary target and chaining to 2 additional targets for the same damage, clearing 3 buffs from chained targets. This attack cannot miss. 

-This new ultimate would give the Avengers more buff clear and help solidify them as a buff clearing team (Hawkeye and Widow already clear buffs well). In addition, Winter Soldier needs to be given the Avenger tag as they are currently missing a good blaster with Iron Man and War Machine MIA and Thor back in Asguard. 

Passive: Gain 50% block chance and 50% block amount. Gain + 10% block chance and +5% block amount per Avenger ally. Grant all Avenger allies +10% health. Grant all Avenger allies +50% focus and resistance. 

-Cap is the team leader and needs to inspire and grant buff to his teammates just by being there. These changes will not only make him a better tank, but will also improve his allies, allowing Hawkeye to land his additional blinds more often. 

Black Widow:

Basic: Attack enemy for X damage and steal all buffs if stealthed. Apply buffs to self. If Hawkeye is an ally, apply stolen buffs to Hawkeye. 

-Black Widow already has a solid basic if she is already stealthed. This will give her some synergy with Hawkeye and allow him some more damage and survivability. 

Secondary: Gain stealth and apply speed up to all allies. Clear all debuffs from self and Avenger allies. Apply immunity to all Avenger allies. Fill speed bar by 50%. Apply Offense up to self and Hawkeye.

-This would solidify Widows secondary ability as the teams support. A full debuff cleanse and immunity for all Avengers would keep them from getting bogged down by the likes of AIM (seriously. How do the Avengers lose to AIM?) and other debuff heavy teams like Brotherhood. It will also allow her to attack quickly again much like Shocker. 

Ultimate: Attack primary target for X damage and apply stun. Chain to 1 additional targets and apply 2 bleed for 2 turns. 50% chance to chain to all additional targets. If Hawkeye is an ally, this ability can not be counter attacked. 

-This will make an already solid ability a bit more reliable as sometimes you’re really counting on that chain attack. It will also keep the attack chain from being broken. 

Passive: Gain 15% dodge chance while stealthed. Gain +10% additional speed per Avenger ally. All allies gain 5% more speed. If Hawkeye is any ally gain +10% dodge chance. Gain 1000% more focus while stealthed. 

This would maintain Widows high speed and give her a bit more survivability with dodge. It would also guarantee her basic would steal all buffs is she was stealthed and give her even more synergy with Hawkeye. 

Speaking of which...

Hawkeye:

Arguably the weakest member of the current Avengers, Hawkeye needs a lot of help to bring him up. 

Basic: Attack enemy for X damage and X piercing. This attack cannot miss and cannot be dodged. Change speed bar by -10%. 50% chance to crit. +10% chance to crit per Avenger ally. 

-This will make Hawkeye a bit more consistent and give him more utility with the change to speed bars. You would be able to prioritize targets like you can with Shield minions and Ultron Bots. 

Secondary: Attack primary target for X damage. Apply blind. Clear all buffs from primary and adjacent targets. Reduce speed bar of primary target by -100%. Reduce speed bar of adjacent targets by -20%. 

-This would make his secondary ability useful even if he doesn’t need to clear buffs. Reducing a characters speed bar to 0 could be the difference in countering an Ultron or a Phoenix that’s preparing to wreck your whole team. 

Ultimate: Attack all targets for X piercing. Apply blind to primary target for 2 turns. 50% chance to apply blind to remaining targets. +50% chance to apply blind to additional targets if Black Widow is any ally. 

-This change makes his ultimate more reliable. Nothing is more disappointing than seeing Hawkeye use his Ult only to see only one person get blinded. This would guarantee the blind effects and make him much more of a priority to deal with. (You could also pair him and Black Widow with Scarlett Witch and use her to extend blond durations). 

Passive: Gain 50% accuracy. +50% accuracy if an Avenger ally is present. Ally Avenger allies gain +10% accuracy. On turn, attack all stealthed enemies for X damage and clear stealth. This attack cannot miss and cannot be dodged. 

-Instead of attacking a single enemy and missing, wasting his passive, Hawkeye will now be an anti stealth machine. This would make him much more effective against Shield, X-Men, and Hand teams that rely on stealth to be effective. 

And now onto the black sheep of the Avengers...

Ant-Man

I have no clue why the devs bothered putting Ant-Man in the game when Captain Marvels stare does more damage than his whole ultimate. Usually we see characters released that are more powerful than ones we have now. Ant-Man kind of missed the boat. He needs a lot in his current kit to make him an option. 

Basic: Attack target for X damage. Clear and copy 1 positive effect to self and Wasp if Wasp is an ally. Clear Taunt. 50% chance to gain evade. +10% chance to gain evade for each Avenger ally

This new basic will make Ant-Man more focused on clearing taunts than just being a worse Black Widow with his basic attack. It will also make him more survivable as he gains evade. 

Secondary:  Attack target for X damage. Apply ability block for 2 turns. Apply disrupted for 2 turns. Clear taunt. Of Wasp is an ally, this attack cannot be dodged. 

Again this will give Ant-Man more utility by allowing him to apply disrupt and clear taunts from tanks to allow you to focus on priority targets. This ability will also become more reliable with Wasp on the team as well. 

Ultimate: Attack all enemies for X damage. If Wasp is an ally, attack all enemies for +100% damage. Apply slow for 2 turns. Apply offense down. 

This ability needs a massive damage buff but I don’t really know how to play with the numbers. However, it also needed more utility and I believe that giving it 2 turns of slow and offense down will make it much more effective as a disrupt ability. 

Passive:  50% chance to assist on hero ally’s turn. If hero is an Avenger, gain +50% assist chance. When Ant-Man performs an assist, apply deflect to self and ally Wasp. Gain 10% dodge chance. Assist attacks now steal positive effects and functions similar to basic attack. 

This was my biggest complaint with Ant-Man. I felt that his assist not performing the benefits of his basic made him very weak. This will now allow him to steal more buffs and apply them to himself and Wasp and will make his assist more reliable. 

Speaking of Wasp, she needs the Avenger tag ASAP. She may not have been an Avenger in the MCU however she was one of the founding members in the comics. If Coulson and Nick Fury get to be Avengers then she does too. Other than that and maybe some minor damage tweaks, Wasp really doesn’t need anymore synergy with the team as she already performs pretty well as a good blaster and a replacement for Thor and Iron Man. 

Hulk also was given a solid rework and doesn’t need too much help. I would suggest a passive health regen. Maybe 10% +5% per Avenger ally per turn. I’d also make his Ultimate do double damage if the enemy has defense up similar to Ultrons Ult. 

That concludes my reworks for the Avengers. Apologies for the long-winded post but I wanted to include reasons for each change I suggested. Hopefully some of these get implemented in the future and bring Earths Most Mediocre Heroes back to Earths Mightiest Heroes. Feel free to discuss the changes or suggest your own in the comments.",MarvelStrikeForce,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStrikeForce/comments/fi1qlt/suggested_avengers_reworks_making_earths_heroes/,Suggestion,TYBERIUS_777,fi1qlt,/r/MarvelStrikeForce/comments/fi1qlt/suggested_avengers_reworks_making_earths_heroes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStrikeForce/comments/fi1qlt/suggested_avengers_reworks_making_earths_heroes/,10,2020-03-13

I’ve always known that you got to take a break from your own life from time to time. I don’t always do this, but sometimes you just gotta. If you can take a moment to read the previous entries, you could surely  understand why.

After a few rain checks and at least two accusations of drunk dialing, one of my fellow anarcho-pharmacists said I could come over to his place for a few drinks. And I am just going to head this off now; we had not gotten into the good shit before all this went down, ok? Alright. So at the appointed time, I headed on over to his high-rise apartment to get a needed few hour vacation from the craziness of my own life.

After a drink or two, we headed out onto his balcony. I told  him how my job is going and he rambled on about the woes of his job. Everything was copacetic. Then, he heads back into his apartment and comes out with a set of binoculars, pointing out the hotel a block or two away.

“Man, you can see some crazy shit in that place,"" he tells me. “People coming in from out of State just don’t give a fuck. One time, I saw a dude fucking this bitch up against the damn window. Seen businessmen blow each other and then snort coke before going back at it. And just once, oh man, there was some sweet lesbian love...”

“Why not get a telescope?” I joked. “Probably get more detail out of one of those than those binoculars.”

“Field glasses,” he corrected me and continued to scan around. “And with a telescope people know you be peepin’. These things be hand-held. No one need know I’m lookin’”

“See anything fun?""

“Nah. So what got you all bummed out anyways? I know cleaning up vomit and blood ain’t fun, but otherwise you got a pretty sweet gig. Hell, all the people you talk to there, other than coworkers and your boss, are fucking crazy. The General Population I gots to deal with in electronics is way more stupid, and they got no excuse.”

“Long story,” I told him, taking a long drink. “Been seeing some weird shit. Not at work. And no, not on the DMT. Also, no one wants to buy weed anymore. Now that it is legal, they all think they’re about to be drug tested.”

“You got to educate them, man. They be trippin’. Just little bit of bleach or some herbal cleansers and no one gonna know they doing stuff. I got the hookup on some pills now though. Kinda shit that ain’t ever gonna be legal. I would try to set you up with them, but it is getting a bit scary. I had to have a meeting with this big Russian motherfucker about some damn quotas. Goddamn quotas.”

“Molly?”

“Molly, meth, some new fungal shit, you name it. They don’t even wanna hear the whole thing about recreational weed taking up the customers. The only reason I stay in is ‘cause the money is good so far. That and they promised I won’t be hassled.”

“Sounds like they’re hassling you.""

“With the Latinos gone it’s either them or Demaurice’s boys controlling the supplies. Sometimes one of Demaurice’s lieutenants gets a bug up their ass and comes to find you. Even with someone like me, only slinging at friends and family, it’s good to have someone at my back. Enough with this serious shit. Take a look around.”

With that, he handed me the “field glasses.”

I put them up to my face and set my sights on the hotel. Many of the windows were covered, unfortunately. There were some people up in the restaurant doing their usual thng, and somewhere in the middle floors I noticed a couple arguing in front of the widow. Figuring that was a bust, I decided to glance over to the parking garage to see if there was anything interesting. For the most part, I found what you would expect: parked cars. Only one of them, a vintage Beetle, held my interest for more than a nanosecond. Even then it was a blue one. I have nothing against the color, but those old timey Beetles always look best in yellow or black. Blue just seems like a boring color for them. Moving my head to the left slowly, I happened upon two people, one with his back against the wall. 

“Anything good?” my buddy asked.

“Nah,” I said as I watched him get up. “Nothing cool in the hotel. Seems to be an argument or something in the parking garage.”

“Well let me know how it goes, I need to take a piss.”

I peered back into the glasses as he left the balcony. Quickly, I found my arguing guys, except now they did not seem to be arguing. The man with his back to me was putting a tube of some kind around the other guy’s neck. I adjusted the glasses to look more closely and saw that it looked less like a tube and more like a very long sausage. A sausage that was dripping. Dripping onto the floor and the walls and coming from the man’s gut. My jaw clenched, but I could not look away, as the dude was having his wrists duck taped to the wall. The next thing I saw started to make my stomach turn; he scooped  the duck taped victim’s eye out with a spoon and left it dangling. Blood splattered down his face as he wriggled. Unable to think about taking the field glasses from my face, I moved them to look away and saw a teddy bear peeking out of a burgundy backpack. 

Okay, so I know I have posted some crazy shit up in here. But I swear to Almighty God, that fucking teddy bear was looking at me! His head even moved with me when I tried to not look at those creepy little black eyes of his. Soon, I could not take it anymore and my hands lost their grip on the binoculars. My buddy reached over and saved them. He was giving me the third degree evil eye and then his face softened. Probably saw the shocked expression on my face. 

“What is it, my dude?” he asked and peered through the glasses. 

“Parking garage,” I spit out. “Third level...to the left.”

“I don’t see anything, yo. Whoa! What in Jesus H Fuck?!”

“He-he cut out the man’s entrails and put them around his neck..”

“And in his mouth! What the fuck is he doing with his eyes?! Shit shit shit! Okay, time to take the party inside, yo.” 

He grabbed by the arm and yanked me into his living room, closing the large window that went out onto the balcony. 

“Dude,” I said rubbing my temple, trying to get a grip. “We need to call the fuzz, man. I know, I know, you got some shit in here but we can talk to them in the hallway.”

“Negative,” he said holding his hand out to me.

   “That’s a fucking murder happening over there, man!”

“I know, I know. Look, you don’t know how fucked the people I work with are, my dude. After my little visit with that big fucking Russian dude, they told me they had some sort of ‘specialist’ that might come see me if I ever squealed. Said they guy would not only kill me but make a Picasso outta my dead body. Now I ain’t with that, so I don’t snitch, you hear me? I think that was the guy.”

“The guy the big Russian told you about?” my hands were shaking and I had to sit down as my stomach threatened to lurch into my mouth.

“Nah, he didn’t talk at all really. Just looked scary and in charge while some other guy gave me the business. Now, you feel some kinda way about this, I get it. You can go ahead and call the police, but you gotta get up on outta here first. Or, you can stay here and chill a minute.”

“I-I get it,” I said, getting up. “But I hafta call someone. I’ll give a call in a few days, ok?”

“Ai’ght, but make that call outside of the building.” 

My friend gave me a quick hug and a pat on the shoulder before I headed out. Guess I must have really looked shook. I exited the building and got into my car, calling the police on my way home. And yeah, don’t judge me. I got a hands-free thing, ok? I gave them the location of the parking garage and refused to give them by name or confirm my number. I guess when they found the body they really did not have a lot of questions because I didn’t get a call back. Besides, I only saw the back of the assailant’s head anyways. Don’t think I mentioned the teddy bear. And really, it wasn’t until I was off the phone and almost home that my brain put it together. 

It must be the same bear, guys. Brown fur, kinda big. Just like Chuckles described it. What I have to wonder is if that was Jones playing around with the guy’s innards. Remember patient J from the reading of Chuckles’ journal? Yeah, that guy. Add no, I don’t care about hiding his name anymore. Hell, he ain’t even a patient anymore. Come to think of it, those gals at the diner mentioned him too, I think. Shit. Well, if you were wondering what happened to the bear, at least I got you a partial answer. 

Well, I got back to my place and flopped onto the couch. Part of me wanted to check if there was any news online, but I was honestly burnt out. And it was then that I noticed something odd. Something terrifying. That old haunted copy of Number Munchers was sitting on my coffee table! After all I did to get rid of it!

LOL. Ok, that one was lame, but what do you want? Yeah, I got home, sat on the couch and stared off into space for a good long while, probably still shaking like a leaf.  I think I got myself a beer and just eventually went to sleep. No, no Number Munchers game, sorry. I do have the sneaky suspicion that I don’t really know what I have gotten into in all of this. I’ll call my buddy in a few days and make sure he did not get any heat for this. And yeah, it seems the people he is slinging for are fucking nuts, just like those diner bitches

Or maybe I am the one loosing my Goddamn mind.

I really gotta find Chuckles at work sometime soon.",nosleep,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fi6hkq/bad_things_happen_in_parking_garages/,Series,PartyL1keStink,fi6hkq,/r/nosleep/comments/fi6hkq/bad_things_happen_in_parking_garages/,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fi6hkq/bad_things_happen_in_parking_garages/,2,2020-03-13

Gamora bonds with Nebula by bending over and taking her sister's cock in her ass.

While the boys are playing video games, Raven and Starfire 69 in Starfire's room.

Sick of Captain Marvel's attitude, Scarlett Witch uses her powers to humble the hero a bit... by making her desperate for Wanda's cock.

Black Widow infiltrates Wakanda only to be caught and double teamed by Okoye and Shuri.

So yeah, basically title. I'd like to write about some slutty Marvel or DC ladies who are more interested in sucking cock and getting fucked than anything else. Maybe everyone's just significantly sluttier in this reality, maybe some villain's plan made everyone into a huge slut, whatever the case may be. I'd love to do multiple scenes or something too, if you're interested in a longer term RP.

As far as what characters to play, I am open! Let me know your favorites!

I RP in 3rd person. I would like you to do the same.

As far as limits, it's the usual. No toilet stuff, blood/gore/vore, death, beastiality, etc. No impreg, just not interested. Absolutely no ageplay/underage. Don't even mention it, I have no interest. All characters must be 18+.

If you're interested, please shoot me a message!

"Looking for a long-term and detailed Role player, F for M","As the world (mine at least) is preparing for staying in, I'm looking for new RPs. I'm a very very devoted writer, but I don't expect perfection or even first language English (mine isn't though I'm published in both). 

I write F main characters (any minor) as a rule and most of the time. I will for the right RP take on M/M or M/M/F. I always need a good plot, I don't go for the filth fest but real world logic. I also do not fade to black and aim for a pairing in each story. Darker themes are good but I like a non tragic end. I rp on Google docs, pms or Discord. Almost any genre, historical, scifi, modern (with an interesting premise not ""high school""). Canon or OCs. 

So, is it a freedom fighter's widow in a fate forsaken Slavic country deciding the dictator needs to die? 

Some 20's-50's mafia story?

Grown up Matilda figures Stansfield's still alive?

Older Ginny finds out Tom's diary?

Maybe, you never asked to be assigned a handmaid, but you are?

Mrs jacobs,"Mrs Jacobs was old and I mean old.
She outlived everyone in our housing estate had buried three husband's and no one was quite sure of her age exactly but my friends and I liked to joke that she was a serial killer and done them all in for their life insurance and what not .
Basically the story is as follows. 

Her first husband whom I had never met and wasn't even born when he passed was Padjoe.
Padjoe was found outback in his shed amongst a pile of turf and kindling with neatly chopped logs piled like towers all around .
He had slipped and died of an injury to the head or so everyone was told.

Word on the down low was that Mrs Jacobs tired of Padjoe and his endless chattering crept up behind him the rain and wind masking her footsteps and in one swift blow caved his skull in with a perfectly sized log that Padjoe had previously brought inside as extra firewood.
After an acceptable period of mourning Mrs Jacobs re married .

A man by the name of Tom
My mam said Tom was a big burly man that never said much to no one but always tipped his hat or nodded as he shuffled on by or drove onto his property.
I was always ready to tell my friends anything I found out and I found out lots and lots well because Mrs Jacobs was my neighbour and lived right next door .

Our back yards were separated by a large eight foot high fence each with our own large sheds and things all gardens have.
The front of our property was separated by a pathetic attempt at a wall at its lowest three feet high and it's highest at maybe five feet as it steadily heightened from where it began in the front and ran towards the back garden and our back gate.
I could see all of Mrs Jacobs garden and shed perfectly from my bedroom window .

Back to Tom .
After I think five happy years of marriage Tom was found at the end of the stairs having had a terrible fall and twisting his neck as he did so and leaving poor Mrs Jacobs a mournfull widow for a second time.

Now we assumed we knew exactly what happened Tom .
Mrs Jacobs tired of Tom and his wandering eyes as he was fond of peering out the landing window on  top of the stairs watching for any pretty girl that he may have the joy of watching as they came and an even better view as they left .
Well that's what we had learned of Tom and his ways and so the motive for his death was pretty simple really and Mrs Jacobs now in her late fourtees took advantage of Tom's perched position and all it took was a shove as he tumbled down the thirteen steps to his death.

We didn't believe he died as fast as poor old padjoe oh no.
Tom s death was far worst and one of anger jealousy and brute force.
As his mangled body lay on the floor dazed pitifull and bones definitely broken the last thing he saw was his wife decending the stairs and the thumps of her footfall as his wandering eyes watched her approach .

We imagine she shushed him as he attempted to bargain and plea for help .
Then leaning over him like the reeper himself she twisted his neck until she heard it pop .
I was 15 when Mrs Jacobs married Fergal and she still went by her same old name of Mrs Jacobs.
I'm not quite sure of how old she was when they married but life had begun to take it's toll on her and the stories of her two dead husband's her black widow status and marital curse was common knowledge in our little community.

Fergal was a brave man in my opinion
Either brave or foolish I'm not certain.
Out of all her husband's I only knew Fergal.
He was a skinny man always dressed to impress and had a pipe in mouth no matter where he went.
He had a strong rural Kerry accent and had moved here not long before him and Mrs Jacobs met and as the story goes it was love at first sight.
He doted on his wife and worked hard to support and give her anything she wanted.

Many an evening I would watch from my window as he built her outdoor benches gazebos and dug up alllotments for flowerbeds that looked beautifull on both sides of her shed.
He turned their garden into her very own wonderland and ours looked rather dull and unkempt in comparison.
Fergal worked morning noon and night until the faithfull day death came a calling oh and it came with more of a scream than a call.
The day came when fergal simply vanished.
Like a flower simply plucked from the earth fergal had disappeared.

I still remember the searches the neighborhood was flooded day and night for what felt like weeks.
The curse of Mrs Jacobs I thought at the time and thought back to the nights and chilling stories of the Jacobs murders but I quickly pushed that thought away .

Fergal and Mrs Jacobs had been married for more than twenty years and he was at least in his 70s and missing.
It didn't feel right to let childhood stories see the light of day in such a sad time.
I was genuinely upset and actually really liked fergal .
He had thought me things like how to change a tyre on a car and how to check the oil and all that kind of stuff .

He was a real decent man and a great neighbour.
I took part in almost every search I could until eventually it all died down.
I remember still the atmosphere in the community was stale and grief stricken as rumours and tales of fergals whereabouts bounced around.
Tales worlds apart of course did their rounds.

One was a fancy woman he had run off with that was years younger than him. The next was murder and others told tales of him being injured in a field someway somhow to make him unable to make it home and becoming a victim of the elements .
The truth would reveal itself around six weeks after poor fergal vanished.

There is an old well a few miles from my house in the back arse of nowhere in a patch of woodland .
Mainly locals know off it and it is or it was a kind of wishing well before the incident.
A family were walking through the area and the little girl Sarah O Brien I believe begged her daddy for a coin to flick in and make a wish and he begrudgingly obliged.

Upon doing so she placed her head above the seemingly bottomless black pit and peered down but recoiled and gagged in horror.
The smell coming from within was undoubtedly the stench of death.
To make a long story shorter il spare some details but yes upon investigation and when a member of the fire department was lowered within human remains were retrieved.
Word spread like wildfire before even the official statements were announced that fergal had been found .

It was soon official it was fergal and it was a blow to Mrs Jacobs and the community at large .
It wasn't the answer we had longed for but it was an answer I suppose and the traffick began decending upon Mrs Jacobs as a steady flow of flowers and mourners payed their tributes to the grief stricken woman .

I had heard from a friend that was friends with the fireman lowered into the well and he had heard that the name Maura was carved somehow into the wall at the bottom of the well and that fergal was believed to have done it in his final moments with bloodied fingers shredded down to bone from clawing at the stone walls within before carving his final word his wife's name.

The very sentiment sent shivers down my spine.
A final declaration of love for his wife or an accusation
 his killers name in his final minutes.
I guess we will never know but it was declared as accidental and that's how it stayed even though of course there were whispers especially amongst us who grew up with the grim tales of Mrs Maura Jacobs as a childhood nightmare and ongoing saga in the neighborhood.

Months turned into years and Mrs Jacobs to this day still lives next door to my parents .
She hasn't remarried and I think she has to be at least ninety now surely.
When I come home and stay the odd weekend I can't help but notice her strange yet familiar goings on.
At 2am a small hatchet in hand in the dim yard lit by a motion sensor light she will chop away at kindling like a pro never missing never fumbling.

Chills run down my spine when she occasionally out of nowhere will rapidly turn and lock her eyes with mine as I peer out my window watching her in the night. How does she know I'm watching and exactly where to look . It weirds me out it doesn't bare thinking about.

My mom says she's gone a little senile and rambles and mumbles and even steals flower pots and statues from our front yard nowadays.

The final straw for me though and why I'm writing all this was because of last weekend .
We never really had any proof of any of our tales of Maura killing her husband's .
It all just seemed like one poor woman's bad luck and devastatingly sad life that we had twisted as kids do into a terrifying tale and let our imaginations run way to wild.
She had never as much as shown an ounce or incling of violence.
All in all she was a frale old woman that had lived a tough sad life full of loss and full of grief...


Like I said that all came to an end last weekend.
I was home visiting my parents and it was after midnight when I realised I had forgotten to bring in extra turf and sticks to keep the fire burning all night.
My parents were already in bed so I turned of the yard sensor light and just used my phone as I made my way down the garden to the large steel doors of our shed .
I flung one open and stepped in amongst the shadows 
A little light from my phone and the moonlight guided the turf from the pile to my barrel .
It was around then I felt it.
An uneasiness and the hairs standing on my neck .
I snapped around in a second and almost collapsed with fright .

Standing almost completely in the shadows was Mrs Jacobs holding a thick block of wood .
I know I'm over thirty years off age but I screamed like a child of five .
I screamed until I must of woke the neighborhood and eventually my parents arrived to see the comotion.
There was me shivering screaming blue murder heart pounding in my ears and Maura in the corner holding a piece of timber the wind subtly blowing her dress in the breeze  
She already looked like a corpse and her grey complexion amongst the shadows did nothing to quench the fear within me.

The situation to me seemed to dissolve far to quickly .
I wanted police I wanted helicopters swat teams I wanted it all because in my mind all the pieces to the puzzle fit perfectly and this was clearly how padjoe met his maker all those years ago.

What I got was very different .
Dirty looks told to shut up etc mumbles from my parents and neighbours of other houses that had arrived in the screams.
It was like I had done something wrong and they were disgusted with me .
My mother was beside herself with shame giving out and asking why I didn't help the obvious lost and dazzled old lady .

God forbid I ever get confused in my old age she would mumble.

I refuse to stay at my parents now.

I don't think the people want me around much after that anyway but I don't care I'm happy to stay clear because I know what was really going down in that shed.
Mrs Jacobs might have been in an episode of delusion but one thing is clear she was on a mission and if I hadn't of saw her in the shadows I'm sure I would have been her fourth victim.

I wonder sometimes if she was ever in their unnoticed as I gathered firewood or if she is ever perched in a corner watching my mom or dad .

The very thoughts keep me up at night and even give me nightmares.
I don't ever want to see that woman ever again and God how I wish my parents would move if not for their safety just for my peace of mind.
It might not be today but I'm sure Mrs Jacobs will strike again it's simply a matter of where and when and I pray my family do not become entwined forever as a chapter of her horrid tale.",nosleep,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fi7jh4/mrs_jacobs/,,bobbydazzeler,fi7jh4,/r/nosleep/comments/fi7jh4/mrs_jacobs/,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fi7jh4/mrs_jacobs/,13,2020-03-13

What will happen to Marvel Phase 4 slate?,"I wasn't too sure if there was a thread about talking about this, but since Disney is suspending productions and delaying films, it seems like the Marvel slate may be impacted massively. Shang Chi's production just got shut down. I assume Doctor Strange 2 isn't going to get off the ground anytime soon. Black Widow will probably be delayed. This whole situation could really mess up the timing of MCU. 

Would it be a good idea for Marvel to ditch the May 1st date and shift everything back? Meaning Black Widow takes Eternals date and Eternals takes the Shang Chi date and so on. This is all hypothetical since we don't know how long this situation could last but if it continues for another month, MCU movies might have huge problem going forward.

Black widow face swap &amp; the soul stone,"So there was a new rockstars video analysis of the final black widow trailer and they talked about the scene where it looked like Yalena was having face surgery. They had a wild guess that what if she face swapped Nat and was her the whole time in endgame etc. 

I don’t think this is the case but it got me and friend talking. 

If anyone face swapped/took the identity of another. Went to vormir and did the whole sacrifice thing. Would they get the soul stone? I mean, you sacrifice someone you love and if you 100% believe it is the person then the sacrifice is real right? So you’d get the soul stone. Without ACTUALLY sacrificing the person you love.

[F4M] Your Newest Slave Girl,"I had a good life once. Every day was peaceful and carefree, without a worry in the world. That all changed the day the slavers arrived, three weeks ago. They swarmed into my town, pillaging each building and taking everyone prisoner. No one managed to escape alive. Me, my family, and my friends were all suddenly thrust into the horrible world of slavery.  Each one of us was individually evaluated by the slavers' chief. Those deemed too weak to be beneficial, such as most of the elderly and sick, were executed. The strongest of the men were grouped together, as were the smallest of the children. One by one, we were all sorted out based on use. 

After hours of waiting, my evaluation finally came. One of the slavers came and collected me from my prison cell, dragging me away from my family. I didn't know it then, but I would never see them again. The slaver, a burly, hairy man, grabbed me by my long hair and clamped a heavy metal collar around my neck. Letting go of my dark locks, he pulled me by a leash into a small, brightly lit room. The man chained me to a post and released me. As he stepped away, another man entered - the slavers' chief. 

""All right, let's make this quick. Strip, now."" 

Tears welled up in my eyes as I shook my head violently. Sighing, the man pressed a button, and I felt a sharp shock course through my collar and into my body. 

""I said strip, slave. Don't make this harder than it has to be."" 

Whimpering, I shrugged off my dress, leaving only my underwear. Maybe, I thought, just maybe I can have *some* modesty. Another shock gives me my answer. 

""The undergarments too. Now!"" 

Reluctantly, I reached back and removed my bra, letting it fall to the floor and giving the man an eyeful of my perky tits. My panties join the bra on the floor, exposing my most intimate areas. The slave chief looks me up and down appraisingly, then steps closer. He touches my face, calculating, tracing his fingers down my neck. They make their way down to my breasts, which he feels and squeezes delicately, even stopping to tweak my sensitive nipples. Further down still they go, going over my mound and running back up along the curve of my ass. All the while, I whimper in helpless fear. 

The chief turned to his man, the one who brought me here. ""She'll do just fine as a pleasure slave. Put her with the others."" Nodding, the man took my naked body by the leash and led me out to a room filled with the other young women of my village. For a few weeks, we were all trapped in there, miserable. The pleasure slaves were fed only meager scraps, and forced to relieve themselves in a corner of the room. The smell grew unbearable fast. Finally, the day of the slave auction came - today. 

The others and I are led out to the market, already filled with potential buyers. The pleasure slave section in particular has amassed a large crowd. My wrists and ankles are latched into a metal frame, positioned to provide the best view and access for any customers. Quickly, a crowd of interested people gathers around me. My bare body is poked and prodded again and again, much to my discomfort. After what feels like hours of groping and abuse, a figure steps away from the others - my new buyer. 

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Hey there! So I'm looking for someone to roleplay as my cruel, perverse, and sadistic master. I'd love to incorporate noncon, humiliation, ENF, exhibitionism, forced stripping/stripteasing, groping, forced blowjobs/anal, buttplugs, rimming, beast/tentacle, watersports (receiving), maybe some body modification, and being forced to wear a leash and skimpy outfits/lingerie. 

My only hard limits are blood/gore, snuff, breeding, and futa. 

Below are some choices for where your story can go from here. I left the setting intentionally vague and ambiguous so that you have some freedom to choose that as well. With a few details changed, the roleplay could occur in medieval times, modern day, an apocalyptic future, or perhaps even a galaxy far, far away. The choice is yours. 

Option A: I am bought by a grotesque barbarian warlord, who parades me around as his trophy slave. I'm not his only slave girl, but I'm his favorite. Someday, he hopes, I will carry his heir. 

Option B: I am bought by a sleazy nightclub owner (this could be set in modern day or the future) to entertain his club's guests. This will entail me being a stripper or a waitress, forced to obey the demands of the club's customers (you could play the owner and/or the individual customers). Another variation on this: I play a celebrity in this same scenario, forced to work at a strip club/brothel made of other young, enslaved celebs.

***Option C:*** I am bought by a Hutt from the Star Wars universe, and used as his personal fucktoy. In versions of this roleplay that I've done before, the Hutt's tail basically functions as a tentacle/cock.

Option D: I am bought by a wealthy family as a maid, and forced to perform both real and sexual chores around their mansion.

Option E: I am an up-and-coming young actress, and you play my perverted agent/producer (think Harvey Weinstein). I'm pressured into serving as your sex slave for a weekend, reluctantly serving your every need. I really need this gig, no matter what it takes. For this, I could play as an actual celeb. Some celebs I'm interested in playing are Emma Watson, Alexandra Daddario, Emily Ratajkowski, Chloe Bennet, and Emilia Clarke. 

***Option F:*** Alternatively, maybe we could even combine all of those celebrities all in an underground brothel and club reserved for only the 1% of the 1%, the elites who run the world. There, celebrities are kidnapped and enslaved, forced to serve and pleasure wealthy businessmen however they desire. We could even bring more celebrities into the story here. You could play the club owner, and maybe some of the patrons too. I've got [a prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/9p6d91/f4gm_welcome_to_club_aprico/?st=jq64g5tf&amp;sh=7d32cf1f) written up for this one specifically. 

Option G: More Rule 34! You pitch the characters and the scenario to me, as long as it has the same general theme as my prompt. Some worlds I'd like to explore include: 

* **Harry Potter** 

* Avatar: The Last Airbender/The Legend of Korra

* **Anything in the MCU (esp. Black Widow!)**

* Game of Thrones

* **Star Wars**

Option H: Invent your own buyer/concept! Just keep the situation generally detestable in tone please. 

(Bolded are my preferred choices for now)

If you're even slightly interested, shoot me a PM! We can work out the details and tailor the scene to fit both of our kinks and interests. In general, I might not be able to respond every day if you want to keep up the prompt long-term, but I'll always try to continue when I can. Please write more than a sentence for your reply – I want to hear your thoughts and ideas! 

**The more exciting, vivid, and creative you are, the better chance you have at getting a response :)**

**I will not respond to Reddit Chat messages.**",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fhrm58/f4m_your_newest_slave_girl/,,Salthook,fhrm58,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fhrm58/f4m_your_newest_slave_girl/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fhrm58/f4m_your_newest_slave_girl/,0,2020-03-13

X-Men Character Discussion #35 - Neena Thurman/Domino,"This week, I figured we'd take a look at Domino, the gun-slinging warrior woman of X-Force fame.  Created in the Nineties by Rob Liefeld, she's had a surprising amount of appearances over the years, and she slowly and subtly ended up evolving into a pretty fun character.  Where once she was this angry valkyrie, she's evolved a sense of mischief and fun, as befits someone with luck-based powers.  An adaptation of her kind of stole the show in the most recent Deadpool film.  She's also one of the characters that most grabbed your attention in Dawn of X, in part because of just how gruesome what was done to her was.  But Domino soldiers on.  So, what do you think about Domino?  

* Domino's origin was clouded in mystery for much of the time that we've known her.  When she first showed up in the early Nineties, she clearly had a history as a female mercenary of some repute, a part of the somewhat-renowned Six Pack.  Back in the late-Eighties and early-Nineties, being a mercenary was very vogue.  However, eventually we learned a bit about where Neena Thurman came from.  She was the product of a program of scientific breeding, to try and create a super-soldier.  The legacy of Steve Rodgers has probably caused more human suffering than pretty much anything else in the Marvel Universe.  This particular shadow government institution, Project Armageddon, seemed to be interested in the X-Gene, but found Domino's luck power to be too unpredictable.  Eventually, they created a brother for her who was part of the focus of Domino's second mini-series, and who was implied to have died in it.  I wonder what Krakoa thinking about genetically-engineered artificial mutants?   At any rate, she escaped from the project with the help of her biological mother and ended up working for the Catholic Church (her mother was a big believer who ended up leading a group of Catholic special forces called the Armajesuits before Dom shot her) before finding her calling as a mercenary, doing jobs for whoever paid the best.  Like Deadpool, she was a 'Merc For Money', although isn't that the entire point of being a mercenary?    

* Domino's power is her superhuman good luck, which is actually the ability to manipulate probabilities, and especially the probabilities of physical phenomena.  It's similar to Longshot's power, but a little bit more limited.  Whereas Longshot might just coincidentally meet someone who will help him out, Neena's powers tend to operate more along the lines of moving perfectly to dodge a hail of bullets or throwing a knife that riccochets around to break a critical machine powering the Anti-Mutant Death Ray.  Although her powers are tremendously useful in her line of work, he main weapons are still her sharp eye, her wealth of experience, her fantastically-trained body and her arsenal of firearms.  We mainly only see her power come up in combat or in gambling situations, but it's a pretty useful power to have.  

* We were introduced to Domino in the pages of Liefeld's X-Force, where she was a recurring character and a friend and ally of Cable for a while.  In fact, she was actually on the team before she ever joined the team, because the shapeshifting mutant Copycat was wearing her form when she infiltrated X-Force.  Domino, who had been held prisoner, definitely held a grudge against Vanessa over that.  Still, when Sunfire and Feral left the team, Cable brought in Domino to help out, and the experienced mercenary became something of a den mother to the team of mutant teenagers.  Although Cannonball was Cable's second-in-command, Domino was still an authority figure, and although everybody respected her, she wasn't just one of the kids.  The focus really wasn't on her a lot of the time, and she was more like the kickass young aunt.  However, one storyline that I found really interesting was when a Prime Sentinel used cybernetics to mess up her powers and her control over her body.  Suddenly, Domino wasn't quite the force she had always been, although she was still capable of taking care of herself, even standing up to Shatterstar with her handicap.  Still, she left the team for a while until she could get herself fixed by the mutant Bedlam, at which point she rejoined the team.  From there on, she would pass in an out of X-Force over the years, luckily avoiding the Pete Wisdom years.  She was, however, part of the Utopia X-Force, as well as the Weapon X X-Force and even the brief recent run before House of X and the Dawn of X X-Force.  She's been on every incarnation of the team except for the Fantomex/Psylocke one.  

* Domino  has always been coming and going out of X-Force, and it's not uncommon for a random team of mercenaries that show up in a comic book to include her.  She was part of a government-backed squad of female mercs sent to capture the Punisher.  She's fought with and against Deathloks.  She's repeatedly shown up in Cable's solo books, either on her own or as part of a group that will either help or hinder whatever plans that Cable has.  For example, when he was running his Providence operation, Neena showed up with a new Six Pack, taked to take him down.  When Cable needed an assassination carried out (against a supervillain named Flag-Smasher who had taken over a fictional Eastern European country), it was Domino that pulled the trigger.  She's also worked with Deadpool, both in and out of X-Force, although she gets frustrated by Wade's nonsense.  Still, there's a grudging respect there.  The result of this is that Domino has appeared in a ton of different books, not all of them from the X-Office.  

* Still, she's been a reliable fighter for the mutant cause, by and large.  In addition to all her X-Force incarnations, she worked for Xavier's X-Corp, and was useful in ferreting out Sublime's mutant chop-shops.  After the Decimation, she was with the 198 and ended up swearing allegiance to Utopia and fighting to protect it from the Avengers.  And of course now she's part of Krakoa's first line of defence.  For all her rough edges, she's a good citizen.  

* In matters of the heart, Domino has has had two serious relationships and a lot of flings.  The first serious relationship was with a brilliant scientist named Dr. Milo Thurman, who she met and fell in love with while working for the US government.  They were married, and indeed she still carries his name to this day.  In fact, given her background, it's likely that the only reason she has a last name at all is due to her marriage.  Still, this happened before we met her, and it only came up in Domino's first miniseries.  The two were separated during a raid by unscrupulous people looking to get at all the secrets in Milo's head, and each believed the other dead until they met during Domino's early time with X-Force, when Milo was kidnapped and ended up dying for real.  Milo is more tragic backstory than anything else.  Narratively, Domino's main romantic relationship has been with Cable, going back to their time with the Six Pack.  I've always felt that they had a very interesting dynamic, because while they both care for each other very much, they're both busy professionals whose lives aren't centered around romance, but rather their work.  It's kind of telling that perhaps the most iconic scene with the two of them being close, Domino wasn't actually there, but was actually Copycat.  There's a lot of love there, but Cable always prioritizes whatever mission he's created for himself, and Domino struggles to trust.  In recent years, Dom has started some relationships with some big, strong men.  There was a fling with Wolverine, and another with Shang-Chi.  One that I found kind of weird was Warpath, just because of their history in X-Force.  It's like he started dating someone who taught him when he was in high school.  There's nothing wrong about it, but it felt weird for me.  Colossus worked better for me, but I think those two are just two ships passing in the night.  Ultimately, while Neena needs companionship, she doesn't need romance to be complete.    

* Domino's most recent foray into mercenary work was an all-female squad, at first consisting of herself, the one-time villain and Captain America-ally Diamondback, and the cowboy mercenary Oulaw.  This was Gail Simone essentially recreating the superheroine sisterhood that had worked so well for her 'Birds of Prey' series for DC, and overall I liked it.  The girls would go on missions, bust some heads and have some light, occasionally raucous fun.  Outlaw's unpolished nature and impulsiveness meant that Domino had to be responsible and rein her in, or when the circumstances were right just let loose right alongside her.  The ongoing series (which only lasted ten issues) and the Hotshots miniseries (which added the Wakandan Atlas Bear and the Korean White Fox, as well as Black Widow to the Posse) were good fun, and I was sorry to see them go.  Probably one of my favorite X-solo runs in recent years, up there with All-New Wolverine.  It was also nice to see Dom making some friends of her own and setting her own agenda.  For a character who had spent so much time pursuing her own interests outside an X-team, she seemed awful solitary, and the Posse weren't just mercs handling some weird adventures, but also friends.  Given what happened to Domino after Krakoa was established, and that Outlaw was also a mutant, I wonder if perhaps we might see the Posse ride again, at least in part.  

While Domino has been a second-tier character for a very long time, the sheer volume of her appearances has been impressive.  When the X-Men took a darker turn in the 2000s, Domino was well-suited to participate.  She's one of those characters who is always around, even if she's mostly just participating in fight scenes, and every once in a while she gets a chance to shine, kind of like Beast in the Nineties.  I think that she's grown and changed a lot over the years, but it's a bit subtle, and she stays true to herself throughout.  

So, what do you think about Domino?  

[Here's](https://www.xavierfiles.com/2017/07/20/entry-080-domino/) an article by Zachary Jenkins over at the Xavier Files, if you want a little more information.

* Whiskey Wednesdays: [Bookmakers](http://bookmakersbaltimore.com/) in Baltimore and [StateFare](https://www.statefaremd.com/) in  Catonsville offer half off most pours on Wednesdays. As of Jan. 10 there's a slight update in terms of Statefare.  Statefare will now do    half off across the board for it's whiskey instead of having a bunch      of   exclusions like Bookmakers. Prices remain super high for their     trophy whiskies   however:  Eagle Rare 17 from 2019 would be $150     instead of $300 for a   pour  (Yikes). This could be a great opportunity     to try a bunch of   whiskey,  for example Buffalo trace would just  be    $4 a pour. Check out   their  whiskey list on their website and  see  if   it makes sense for you   to  visit. In short, on Whiskey  Wednesdays   Statefare is arguably a better bet, on all other days  Bookmakers has   better prices.

Question about pre-orders from an enthusiastic ML noob,"Hi all,

I just got into collecting ML figures a few weeks ago (and am ashamed to say how much $ I've already spent and how many figures I already have), but I have a question about some of the tough-to-find pre-orders.

For example, I would really like the Black Widow gray suit Walmart exclusive, but is it absolutely necessary to pre-order them in order to get them at the normal retail price? Once they get released and the pre-orders ship, do the stores get more in stock? Some of you long-time collectors can probably tell me from experience. What do I do? Is it absolutely necessary to pre-order to avoid aftermarket price gouging?

Thanks in advance!",MarvelLegends,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelLegends/comments/firp9b/question_about_preorders_from_an_enthusiastic_ml/,,SpursPop5,firp9b,/r/MarvelLegends/comments/firp9b/question_about_preorders_from_an_enthusiastic_ml/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelLegends/comments/firp9b/question_about_preorders_from_an_enthusiastic_ml/,6,2020-03-14

[M4F] Harem With a Theme,"Hello lovely ladies, I hope your days are going well. As you can tell by the title, I want to build a harem with a theme. This premise is pretty self-explanatory, however, it gives a lot of options.

So, my first question: What is the theme? The theme could be a physical attribute that the women share or a lifestyle they have in common. I'll leave some suggestions with some examples, but the theme is not limited to my suggestions, nor are the girls limited to the examples.

Branching Out - A handful of reviews from a personal favorite house.,"I've been around Reddit long enough to notice the trend of niche beauty subs getting stuck on repeat, passing around the same cult brands/products. Some are cult favorites for a reason, but you have to admit that it gets a bit boring when all of the swaps offer nearly the same selection or the reviews discuss the same items 50 times over...time to get a little fresh (hopefully) blood in the mix.

**AkimaBotanicals** \- Now this perfume house has been around for quite a while *(est. 2011)*, but I haven't seen it mentioned on the sub before, so I'm betting it'll be new to at least a couple of you. Their pricing is insanely reasonable and you get free shipping with orders of $35+. Most of their scents are available for all of their bath, body, and home products. They have one of my all time favorite indie scents (and daily go to) :

* ***Dragoness*** *(dragon's blood, sandalwood, rose, chocolate, patchouli)* Do you love incense and feeling invincible?  This scent is for you. The rose takes that powdery edge off of the sandalwood and leaves the sexy, sultry spiciness intact, and it lasts **all friggin day.** I get an instant confidence boost every time I put this on.

Other oils I've tried from this house include:

* ***Forest Shadows*** *(cedar, ylang ylang, dragon's blood, fresh herbs)* The herbs in this lend more to a clean scent that anything akin to herbaceous.  Bright floral and  juniper notes over a soft, earthy musk that also lasts seemingly all day.
* ***Bonfire*** (*firewood, cedar, dragon's blood* *^(&gt;.&lt; yes I have a problem)* *, rose)* No doubt about it, this is a king among smoke-infused scents. Wet: Lighter fluid and burning wood. Dry Down: Mostly smoke and the sweet scent of burning wood.  This one is intimidating to wear alone in a public setting but makes a really fun pairing with *Dragoness*.
* ***Hafla*** *(frankincense, myrrh, jasmine, violet, amber)*  Warm and comforting start, the resins are the stars. Eventually the scent be comes reminiscent of a warm cedar box that holds sandalwood incense. Unfortunately, on me the dry down resulted in that all-too-well-known baby powder scent that is a risk with incense-y varieties.
*  ***Cemetery*** *(moist fresh-turned earth, trodden grass, fresh roses left to rest with the ever-sleeping)* One of the purest 'moist-earth' interpretations I've ever come across. The grass notes are present, but never overpowering, and the rose laces it's floral fingers through both notes. You are the widow lingering at the gravesite of your lover and friend. The bouquet of roses you cast upon his new mound silently gather fine droplets of mist as the overcast sky warns of the coming storm. I may be a bit biased towards this one.
* ***Earth Magick*** *(nag champa, green tea, thyme)* So you want everyone to know you're that witch that makes her own tinctures and teas? Here's your calling card. Delightfully herbaceous and earthy.
* ***Vanilla Dusk*** *(vanilla, Egyptian musk, sandalwood)* Spicy, pure vanilla. Simple, beautiful, and was a perfume I gifted to many friends after they would constantly ask to borrow my roll-on.
* ***Tattoo Parlor*** *(black leather, Egyptian musk, sage)* There is NO mistaking the black leather note in this, the musk mellows it out a bit and the sage gives it an earthy-astringent smell that plays well with the leather.
* ***Cloven*** *(clove, blackberry, vanilla, lilac)* I was so excited to try this perfume with these beautiful notes. Unfortunately, this is the one that taught me my skin LOVES to amp the clove. It was a hard way to find out I don't like cloves quite as much as my skin chemistry wants me to BE the clove.
* ***Memories*** *(nag champa, sage, oats, honey)* This is such a softly sweet and comforting oil. I enjoy wearing it to bed. The sage and nag champa keep the sweet notes grounded and prevent them from becoming gourmand, and the sweet notes mellow out the earthy notes and keep them from being to harsh.

The other house name I'd like to put out there for your consideration is **BirchAndStorm.**  I'm not *quite* sure if they count, since their line-up is based on designer scents by the likes of Tom Ford, MEMO, Le Labo, Creed, ect., ect. BUT they are oil based interpretations of these scents and I have yet to be disappointed by a purchase. They are long lasting scents that have an amazing throw, and the price is ridiculously affordable at $5 for a 5mL roll on and $7.50 for a 10mL.

Lastly, I saw a recent poster looking for indie jewelry and I have to rec the shop that made my [wedding set.](https://imgur.com/a/ij40z3z) Traci, the owner of **TazziesCustomJewelry** is incredibly accommodating and even allowed me to pick the stone I wanted set from her current stock! I would describe her work as elegantly whimsical.

Well, thanks stopping by and I hope that you all have a great weekend! I'd like to make a final shoutout to my long-lost love, ***Common Brimstone***, you are sorely missed, but it was a beautiful journey, wasn't it?

"[US-VA] [H] Avengers 196 CGC 9.0+ 1st Taskmaster, Wolverine #1 (2020) Jim Lee 1:100 Hidden Gem Variant [W] Paypal","I am selling Avengers #196 CGC graded at 9.0  This book is the first appearance of Taskmaster which if you don't know, is the main villain in the upcoming Black Widow movie.  This has a beautiful, iconic George Perez cover, and includes the letter from Kurt Busiek. 

The book is in great shape!  It is definitely a beautiful 9.0 book with sharp corners and white pages, but it was not pressed before it was graded (confirmed).  There are some minor creases on the book (not color breaking) that I believe will come out with a press and could be re-slabbed for a higher grade.  The spine has little to no color breaking ticks and looks great.  I wouldn't be surprised if this book went mid to high 9's after a regrade.  Please take a look at the pictures, and let me know if you would like some more.  Selling around FMV **$170 Shipped**

How they're going to bring back Black Widow.,"I believe that the Black Widow that we see in IW/Endgame is not THE Natasha that we know from the rest of the films. Here are the points: 

* In 0:46 of the Final Trailer, Natasha's sister can be seen in a medical bed of sorts, with dark lines around her face. I believe Yelena will be swapped with Natasha. This could make sense because 

1. Black Widow is set between Civil War and Infinity War, and between both films Natasha's appearance is significantly different, as well as her attitude.
2. In Endgame, Red Skull refers to Black Widow as the 'Son of Ivan', which Black Widow is shocked by.

* In order for the Soul stone to work, the sacrifice must be the one that the other truly desires. Black Widow was determined to sacrifice herself because she doesn't feel the same for Hawkeye, whereas Hawkeye feels great love for her. The soul stone wouldn't have been retrieved if Hawkeye sacrificed himself.
* In the Teaser Trailer for Black Widow, they were heavily implying how similar Yelena is to Natasha based off of combat and movement.",MCUTheories,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/fiavtv/how_theyre_going_to_bring_back_black_widow/,,Megamarc9999,fiavtv,/r/MCUTheories/comments/fiavtv/how_theyre_going_to_bring_back_black_widow/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCUTheories/comments/fiavtv/how_theyre_going_to_bring_back_black_widow/,5,2020-03-14

Black Widow Information I heard,"Hello! I am a person who has acess many sources working with Marvel Studios  hence I'll be able to provide details regarding the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I'll be happy to provide them as soon as I get them!

So I've heard many details on the movie but I won't share everything, I'll share only  a few 

SPOILERS AHEAD 

&gt;!The main plot of the movie is stopping Melina Vostokoff from activating the Red Room Program and to stop destroying many lives of young woman!&lt;

&gt;!Taskmaster is revealed to be Mason, Natasha's former lover, who's a former shield agent!&lt;

&gt;!Melina is revealed to be bad as well but changes her mind and fights alongside black widow!&lt;

&gt;!The last fight is between Natasha vs Melina and The Red Guardian vs the Taskmaster, it'll be in a laboratory!&lt;

[M4F] Seeking Superhero Smut,"Hello there, I've been in quite the superhero mood lately. Brought some comics out of storage, been watching the new Harley Quinn cartoon, and even playing through the Spider-Man game(...again haha!), and now I'm craving some superhero related smut!

All characters involved will be 18+, everyone I have listed is canonically 18+ in the comics. Like Starfire for instance, she is in her early 20's and has been for quite a few years now. (And everyone else is in the 20-30 range as well).

**Plot:** Honestly I'm a fan of both Marvel and DC, I know it's a popular trend to love one and not the other but I honestly do love both... unless we're talking about the DCU. So I honestly don't mind what your preference is, you want a Marvel rp then we can do a Marvel one, and the same goes for DC. Though we could always think of an plot that involves both worlds crossing over to the other?

I don't really have a Marvel idea at the current moment, I only have a DC one as this is an idea I've had for quite a few months now. Basically it consists of Shadow Spider(My OC) being transported from the Marvel Universe into the DC Universe due to mysterious circumstances beyond his control(Possibly Doctor Manhattan? He's part of the DC universe now) and unable to get back home. He's eventually forced to accept that he can't go back and decides to make a new life for himself, fighting new villains, teaming up with various heroes, joining the Justice League, and even forming a team of his own with members of his harem? (Honestly we could slowly bring Marvel females into this as well!)

If you have your own ideas though, you're free to suggest them! :)

**Characters -** Listed below are a vast selection of females that I'm interested in pairing up against Shadow Spider, from both Marvel and DC! Along with some other superhero universes

**Marvel:**

Black Cat, Susan Storm/Invisible Woman, Rogue, Emma Frost, Gwen Stacey/Ghost Spider, Enchantress, Carol Danvers, Black Widow, Skye/Quake, White Rabbit, Silk, Psylocke, and various others

**DC:**

Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Batgirl, Supergirl, Jessica Cruz, Black Canary, Starfire, Blackfire, and various others(Don't see somebody? Feel free to ask, I'm just listing off my favorites)

**Other:**

Queen Maeve and Starlight

Aunt Cass from Big Hero 6 (We could make her my character's aunt, if you're okay with incest?)

April from TMNT (Her classic design from the 80's cartoon preferably)

**Kinks:**

I have many kinks, quite a lot actually... but I'll attempt to list most of them. Harems, rule 34, public sex, risky scenes, impreg, breeding, anal, oral, and vanilla, breast play, doggy style, cowgirl style, and I primarily prefer being the dom but I can switch things up from time to time if necessary.

**Limits:**

As said above, everyone must be 18+! Aside from that, there's not too much to list far as limits go. Mostly just scat, yaoi, futa, feet stuff, and cucking.

Anyways we've reached the end, if I managed to keep your interested I appreciate you taking your time and hope to hear from you! Either Reddit or Discord will do, I don't really have a preference so I'm quite flexible on what platform we use!",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ficq4l/m4f_seeking_superhero_smut/,Long Term RP,shadowlarvitar,ficq4l,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ficq4l/m4f_seeking_superhero_smut/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/ficq4l/m4f_seeking_superhero_smut/,0,2020-03-14

So far I've used this PC mostly for gaming (Witcher3, CSGO, XCOM2, looking forward to Cyberpunk 2077). However, due to Coronavirus we just got new home-office regulations at the office allowing us to do home office any day we want to in the future. This means that I will use this PC a lot for writing, data science and some light machine learning stuff (Rstudio + Python) from now on that is not worth the hassle to do on the server. My idea was to upgrade my PC to allow me the following setup:

I want one partition or SSD running Linux Mint for work and one running Win10 for gaming (I was thinking of buying a second SSD). Ideally, I would have one HDD as a data dump that I can access from both partitions and I´ll need to upgrade the RAM to 32GB. I would also need a second monitor for coding. While I was thinking about this, I thought maybe it's a good idea to future proof the whole system for gaming while I´m at it so I was wondering what your suggestions would be to do this. Which parts would be salvagable (GPU?) and which ones would you replace (CPU?)? Or would it be easier to just sell this one and build a new one from scratch?

Childhood Horror Stories. PT. 4 The Hitmen.,"Remember when I mentioned in a previous post that we had people messing around Ty's grandma's trailer often? Well, here's a little background story for why.

I'm almost 150% positive my grandpa's wife had paid people to try and kill us. Why you might ask? Because she is an evil woman. A black widow as they call them. And yes, my grandpa has passed on, God rest his soul. I'm also positive she poisoned him for years causing him to eventually die a slow and painful death. When I was younger, they got together because she threatened him if he didn't, she was going to have his whole family (what was left of us) murdered right in front of him, starting with the children, my cousin and I. She told him, her late ex-husband was in the mafia and she still had connections. My mom thought she was just a crazy old bitch and tried to warn him not to believe her, but he was afraid of her. She stalked him as far as I know and attacked a woman from his church he had started developing feelings for after my Nanny had passed. A real fucking psycho if you ask me.

Our family hated her, but she didn't care, she was going to take everything from us, which included marrying my grandpa and forcing herself to be part of the family. Eventually it became physical between her and my mom. She demanded that my mom call her mom and that I call her grandma, but that wasn't going to happen. One day when she came over there was a fight between her and my mom. It got violent as she threw a knife at my mom all because she wanted the last remaining thing of my Nanny. Her china. It was a ridiculous incident. By the end of it, she had threatened my mom with witchcraft and the police were called, but they did nothing about her because ""she was an old lady"". But that's when our troubles began.

Back then, we lived in my childhood home a little ways out of town, the place my grandpa build with his own hands and where my mom and aunt grew up. During this time, my mom was with a guy named John and he had a son, Gabe. John was older man and his was 12. They lived with us for awhile, I was 6 when they met. But when the stalking had started, I was around 9. They tried to keep me out of it and didn't want me to know that bad things were happening, but I still saw them. I just didn't know what was going on.

For a long period of my childhood there were people outside my house every night trying to break in and kill us. I slept by a huge window facing the back and for several nights I heard noises at my window. Telling my mom and them about the sounds, they covered my window, but didn't say anything other than ""It's just animals."" But I saw foot prints in the mud below my window and they were clearly from a man. I noticed so many things after that as well. One day while I was playing out back, I saw a noose hanging in one of the trees. I didn't think much of it at the time because my mom's boyfriend and his son were hunters and always hung their deer up in the trees when they'd skin them, but this was different. It was tied differently and further up in the tree almost hidden. I know now that they had planned on killing us and hanging out like dead animals.

Another night, about a week or two later, I was sitting in the living room watching tv with Gabe and my mom and we saw a man standing in a yellow rain coat, underneath the street light, just staring at our house. It was very creepy and none of us knew who or why he was here? And John was still at work at the time. My mom tried to tell me it was just the neighbor, but I knew better. He stood there for a while, not moving a muscle. Eventually it got to the point where my mom closed the blinds and called John to get him home early. I'm not sure when the man finally left, but he was gone by the time the cops and John arrived. Less than a month later, I got up to get a drink and when I walked into the kitchen, I saw a man staring at me in the kitchen window.

I gasped and stared at him as he smiled and waved at me all creepy like. I ran back to my room and wasn't sure if I should tell someone or not. I remember a few minutes later, our dogs started growling and barking at the front door. I went into the living room and saw the door handle jiggling as my big standard poodle, Dasher, jumped up and slammed his paws on the door, growling viciously. I had never seen him be so aggressive before. The other four little ankle biters did the same. They knew someone was trying to get in. This woke up everyone else and they came out to see what was going on, but by that time, whoever was behind the door, had stopped. I told them what I saw and they finally told me what had been going on. They even told me how many times they had notified the police and how they did absolutely nothing, so her boyfriend was done and ready to take matters in his own hands.

He got a guard dog from the pound and set him up to alert us of any suspicious activity. For a week straight my friend Ty's grandma and her husband, hid in the woods beside our house and watched every night to make a report without tell us. They saw about 4 men outside the house talking about what they were going to do. At one point they overheard a conversation with one of the men saying he couldn't kill a child and he was done. They also noticed a truck parked down the road and someone sitting in the driver's seat as if they were waiting. The truck looked exactly like my grandpa's wife's truck. That is how we pieced it all together.

At one point we're pretty sure my dog, Dern, the guard dog, killed one of the men because her boyfriend would let him loose when they went out to investigate and he saw him attack one of the men. He tried to find the guy, but all he saw was a trail of blood leading off into the woods. Dern had went for his throat. The stalking went on for months. It got to the point where they started stalking my friends as well. About a year after it started, my mom and her boyfriend ended up breaking up and our two big dogs had disappeared and we were living there alone and defenseless. My grandpa and his wife had then kicked us out of our home, so we had no other choice but to live with Ty's grandma and that's when it started for them.

For a few more months, similar things were happening, we saw people outside the trailer and some point, the two big dogs outside were poisoned. There were several times we were followed and chased off the road. Numerous police reports had been made by not only us, but our friends and their families, but nothing was done about it. Cops would come, check the area and eventually leave saying nobody was out there. It was a waste of time and something we expected from our law enforcement.. But during all that time, I didn't really feel like our lives were in danger, just some asshole getting their rocks off. That was, until one incident when we were home alone.

It had been at least a month and nobody had noticed anything. We thought that maybe they had finally stopped or had gotten caught. Everything was starting to feel normal again. One night while Ty's grandma and my mom had went to the store, we there alone playing video games. It had to of been no later then 8 and I remember hearing something outside. I told him about it, but he wasn't that worried and just ignored it, but I felt like something was different. Before I knew it, the power had went out. This alarmed us and Ty tried to call his grandma on the house phone, but the phone lines were down. Not long after that we heard someone trying to break in through the front door.

Terrified for our lives, we ran and hid in his grandma's big walk-in bathroom and shut the doors. They didn't lock, so I was holding them shut and feeling myself shivering as I laid in the floor looking underneath the gap of the door. The whole trailer was pitch black, but we could still hear them busting in the door. Ty was laying behind me in the shower trying not to breathe heavy, but we were scared to death. Eventually they busted into the trailer and I could see the lights of their flash lights shining on the walls of the living room. Nothing like this had ever happened before and I had no idea what to do at this point. We heard them walking around the trailer going through all the rooms searching for us. Not long after, they made their way towards his grandma's room. I saw their feet and part of what they were wearing through the crack of the door, but not their faces. They were wearing black suits with black gloves and looked exactly like Hitmen. My heart was beating in my ears as I saw them getting closer to the door.

Just before they had time to search the bathroom, a pare of headlights shinned into the windows of the bedroom as a car pulled into the driveway. It was my mom and his grandma. ""Shit!"" I heard one of the men say as they quickly ran towards the back door and fled off the porch. I was in shock. I had never felt so scared. Knowing I was only seconds from death. Ty cried once he realized we were safe. It took my mind and body a moment to rationalize what had just happened. I was trying to keep us calm and safe only being 10 years old. My mom came flying up to the trailer when she saw that the door was broken and they started freaking out once we told them what had happened. By this point, reality set in and I was in tears. They called the police and demanded that something be done, but I can't rightly say if it was or not. It all kind of ended with that because we moved to another town shortly after. I don't know if it was because they couldn't find us or what, but I was just glad it was finally over.

To this day we still talk about those fucked up times. We never got any actual proof that it was my grandpa's wife who hired those men, but after everything that happened, all the things she said, I believe it was her. After my grandpa died, my aunt ended up telling us some things about his wife we didn't know and my mom told her stuff as well. My aunt was convinced she had hired her grandsons and maybe some of their friends to do it since they had been arrested for smuggling weapons and doing other heinous crimes. I could see that being true, but if you ask me? I think those two men that tried to kill Ty and I that night, I think those were legit Hitmen. I know her and her family had alot of money and if it's true what she said about the mafia, then there's no doubt in my mind. I will never forget how close we came to death that night and after everything that's happened to me in the past, I really didn't know just how lucky I was.

Idea for a New MCU Watch Order! / First Post Ever,"So first off, I love this subreddit, it truly means so much to me. I love the artwork, the posters, the fan videos, the memes, the comments, the theories, the tributes, the personal stories, but most of all, the love and positivity of one of Reddit’s most wholesome and supportive communities. This is honestly what I do sometimes when I need a break at work – I come here to peruse and revel in all things Marvel. Because I firmly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of the greatest things in the world. It’s become my absolute favorite franchise of all time (followed by Lord of the Rings and Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, three of the most consistently high-quality franchises ever). Definitely one of the most rewatchable franchises; I can throw on any movie at practically any time and have an absolute blast. And in a world that’s this crazy, it’s oftentimes the wonderful escapism that I need to stay sane.

Anyway, the reason I finally decided to engage with this community is because I had an epiphany today while working from home with Endgame on in the background (p.s. phenomenal lazy Friday movie). I came up with a potential new watch order for the entire MCU (as of Black Widow). The chronology is admittedly not perfect, but to me, it just flows and threads together in a new way and presents a slightly different context to view the entire Infinity Saga narrative. Some of the transitions are much more seamless so in a lot of ways, you have a more direct continuity. I can’t even imagine how different the entire experience might be for someone who’s never seen a single Marvel movie.

Disclaimer: understandably, in order to explain some of my choices, there will be spoilers abound.

**Iron Man**

No surprise, we obviously still start off with Iron Man, arguably the most central character to the Avengers, the Infinity Saga, and the entire universe.   

**Iron Man 2**

“Oh, it’s good to be back.” Directly following his twist announcement, Iron Man is immediately back. (Side note: it makes Rhodey’s re-introduction–this time as Don Cheadle–and Tony’s “surprised to see you here” line that much crazier.)

**Captain America The First Avenger**

If Tony Stark is the most central character, Steve Rogers is a close second. Note: viewers of this order should turn off the movie right after the shot of the kid with the trash lid for a shield. I’ll explain why in a bit.

**Captain Marvel**

The majority of Captain America takes place in the 1940s. Captain Marvel, taking place in the 1990s, is logically then the next movie chronologically. We get the progression of the Tesseract under Shield control. One fun thing is after getting a taste of Nick Fury as the head honcho in Iron Man 2, we get to see a younger field agent version of him kinda be the star of his own story in this one and dream up the Avengers Initiative. Plus, we learn about Ronan before we meet him in Guardians of the Galaxy, which helps set up his whole story with the Kree somewhat better. What’ll be interesting is the effect of having this one set up the cosmic side of the MCU rather than Thor.

**The Incredible Hulk**

I gotta be honest, this one is tricky. Mostly because of the switch from Edward Norton to Mark Ruffalo. I even debated possibly leaving it out. But Phase 1, in a lot of ways, is about tortured people finding themselves and that’s especially true in this one. And the ending pays off so well in the Avengers when he finally reveals his secret to getting angry. The mid-credits scene with Tony and Ross also builds on the whole subplot so far of Nick and Tony slowly, quietly assembling the Avengers.

**Thor**

I first have to say I’m one of those fans who really, really love the first Thor movie. In my opinion, it’s one of the most beautiful stories with one of the most moving soundtracks. Anyway, after Coulson teasing something happening in the Southwest and the end credits tease of Mjolnir, we finally find out who this mystery arrival is.

**Captain America (Ending)**

Okay, so a first-time watcher might’ve reached the end of Captain America and thought “Wait, is Captain America dead? What happened after they found the wreckage of the plan with him presumably frozen?” We see him open his eyes and get brought up to speed very abruptly as the last member to join Nick Fury’s pilot program of…

**The Avengers**

The main reason I had Thor come right before The Avengers is because at the end, we see Loki let go of one goal and fall into the abyss… and then we jump to Thanos handing him the mind control staff and charging him with a new goal. This threads together Loki’s consecutive villain turns. You could even think of the Captain America end scene as a second end credits scene to Thor which then threads together Nick Fury’s role with the Tesseract – he goes from consulting with Dr. Selvig (with the foreboding presence of ghost(?) Loki), and then after he brings in Captain America (another guy very familiar with the Tesseract), slides right into them working on the Tesseract and Loki’s arrival/theft.

**Captain America The Winter Soldier**

Despite being primarily about the eponymous group, Avengers is also a very Shield-centric story and what better way of continuing out of that than with Captain America leading his own Shield missions alongside Black Widow, right before Hydra tears it down from the inside? At the end of the Avengers, Nick Fury even kinda hints at Steve coming aboard when he remarks “A promise” just as it cuts to Cap riding away on his motorcycle. This order also allows some more room before Ultron for Cap and Sam to go on their “missing persons” search.

**Thor The Dark World**

We can all agree: Thor The Dark World is not exactly anyone’s favorite Marvel movie. That’s why it fits perfectly in the second slot between a mind-blowingly good Captain America movie and an awesome third Iron man movie (and I’ll also explain why that leads better into Age of Ultron).

**Iron Man 3**

So what is Tony Stark up to during Phase 2? Well, we hear about him consulting (or “tinkering”) on Shield’s new helicarriers (and subsequently being targeted by said helicarriers), and we pick up here with Tony suffering from PTSD and insomnia. He can’t stop having nightmares about aliens and the threat still up there, “the endgame”. So after a brief distraction/personal growth involving the Mandarin, he trashes his suits, gets the surgery, but assures us no matter what, he’s definitely still Iron Man. (Side note: the end credits scene allows us to briefly pick up with Bruce Banner who apparently hasn’t been doing much besides falling asleep during pro bono therapy for Tony. But we’ll soon find out he’s also been receiving lullabyes from Black Widow.)

**Avengers Age of Ultron**

Ultron is kind of Tony’s movie. In fact, I believe the first line uttered by one of the six Avengers in this movie is Tony going “…Shit!” But Ultron happens precisely because of the aforementioned PTSD and existential anxiety of Iron Man 3 that drives Tony to envision ""a suit of armor around the world"" and Scarlet Witch’s induced hallucination at the beginning is the final push.

**Civil War (Part 1)**

The end of Age of Ultron sees Cap and Widow assembling let’s call it the Avengers alternate roster and Civil War picks up right away with that crew executing a mission in Nigeria that will end up throwing the entire team into chaos and division, sparking the Sokovia Accords. Note: viewers of this order should turn it off right after Sam says “I know a guy.” Trust me.

**Ant Man**

The first Ant Man could somewhat be considered a standalone chapter of the Infinity Saga. So after the first half of Civil War, but before the big airport fight, we’ll quickly flashback and tell the story of Ant Man as a sort of interlude in the middle of Civil War. Because of Sam's line and Luis' recap at the end, it works really well as a flashback chapter.

**Civil War (Part 2)**

So Team Cap has just picked up Ant Man. We pick up the second half of Civil War with Team Iron Man recruiting our other insect-themed hero, the impeccable introduction of Peter Parker/Spider-Man into the MCU. (Side note: hate me if you must, they’re all great, but to me, Tom Holland is the best, most authentic, relatable, and quintessential Peter Parker of all time.)

**Spider-Man Homecoming**

The Avengers have just broken up so having Michael Keaton hold up a child's drawing of the Avengers circa 2012 is a weird juxtaposition. But really, this move was all about Peter Parker’s Civil War home movie that kicks off Spider-Man’s first solo film in an amazingly unique way.

**Black Widow**

None of us have even seen Black Widow yet but we know that it takes place between Civil War and Infinity War so I’m confident that this would be a good spot for it. Part of me wishes I could follow up Civil War with Black Widow but the Spider-Man connection was too good to pass up.

**Black Panther**

Black Panther is another movie that basically takes place directly following Civil War so there’s a part of me that also wishes this one could follow Civil War but this spot is roughly as good as any.

**Doctor Strange**

Finally we come to Doctor Strange. Black Panther had some mystical aspects to it (the astral plane, the heart-shaped herb), but now we really dive into the mysticism and magic of the MCU.

**Guardians of the Galaxy 1 and 2**

Now I bet some of you thought “wait, so when are we finally gonna get to meet the Guardians?” Right now, in between Doctor Strange and Thor Ragnorak, two other cosmic-heavy movies. Both Guardians films take place mere months apart in 2014, so we have to go back in time a bit, but I think watching both consecutively would first, be a very fun experience, and second, having them concentrated together allows us to really get to know them as a team right before we meet them again in Infinity War.

**Thor Ragnarok**

My main reason for putting this here is because I just couldn’t resist the seamlessness of the mid-credits scene with the shadow of Thanos’ ship slowly descending upon Thor and Loki then immediately transitioning into their ship being under attack. (Fun fact: that's Kenneth Branagh's voice during the title credits in case there was one person who still didn't know.) Also, after seeing them grow so much through their relationship as brothers, Thor and Loki arrive at a very sweet, touching place by the end of Thor Ragnarok, so the immediate death of Loki at the hands of Thanos while Thor watches will be absolutely devastating for any first-time viewer.

**Avengers Infinity War**

No explanation needed, other than to say Infinity War is one of the best, most fun, most endlessly rewatchable Marvel movies.

**Ant Man and the Wasp**

Similar to how the first Ant Man acted as an interlude for Civil War, so too will Ant Man’s second outing split the final two Avengers movies. Also, because it ends with the effects of the Snap leaving Hank, Janet, and Hope dusted and Scott trapped in the Quantum Realm, which leads really well into…

**Avengers Endgame**

In my opinion, Scott doesn’t get nearly enough credit for saving the universe by being the essential linchpin to their time travel plan (although I guess you could argue it’s really the rat that made Future #14,000,605 possible). Side note: the **Captain Marvel Mid-Credits Scene** should probably go here, right before Endgame. That would be a disaster to see it all the way back in Phase 1.

**Spider-Man Far From Home**

And naturally, we cap off the order with the latest installment and the Phase 4 kickoff, Spider-Man Far From Home. “Nuff said.”

"My review of Season 6, looking back at it.","Now that we're somewhat in the 7th season of Death Battle, I thought I would look back at my opinion of each fight. What counts as an episode of season 6? Any episode that's is classified as season 6 on the Rooster Teeth website.

(Side note: This is just my opinion. You can disagree with me if you want.)

Aquaman vs Namor (DC vs Marvel): Sure, it's another DC vs Marvel episode, but at least the animation for the fight is good, and the music is decent enough, and I'm happy with the victory of the fight. 7.5/10.

Mega Man Battle Royale: This was an episode everyone was probably waiting for for a long time. Good music, but not my favorite. 8/10.

Black Widow vs Widowmaker (Marvel vs Overwatch): Overwatch still feels like a new game, even if it came out a few years ago, with not enough lore or content for DB to truly make a comparison, but at least the animation wwas good, even if it did feel long. 6.5/10.

Captain Marvel vs Shazam (DC vs Marvel): Oh boy, another DC vs Marvel match! And the match-up isn't even that great, and the track is 4 minutes long, but the fight is 2 minutes! 6/10.

Wario vs Dedede (Mario vs Kirby): I was hoping Wario would have won, but that's probably just me. But at least the guy who was voiced by Sakuari in brawl was interesting. 7/10.

Ben 10 vs Green Lantern (Cartoon Network vs DC Comics): You're gonna dislike me for this, but I'm happy Green Lantern won. Yes, DB might have been a little biased during the battle, but at least they got feedback from the fans. 6.5/10.

Weiss vs Mitsuru (RWBY vs Persona): To quote Akihiko from P3, ""I've been waiting for this!"" When I watched the fight, I had my fingers crossed that DB/RT wasn't too biased to give Weiss the win, but rather using the research, and Mitsru won with her BBTAG/P4A/P4AU insta-kill. The first Persona appearance on the show, and the fist Persona win! The DB fans never saw it coming! 8.5/10!

Johnny Cage vs Captain Falcon (Mortal Kombat vs F-ZERO): The battle music track was pure hype, and a good reason as well. I mean, we finally got to see FALCON PUNCH in a Death Battle episode! 7.5/10.

Aang vs Edward Elric (Avatar vs Full Metal Alchemist): The music was good, but I barely know anything about each original series, so..I'd give it a 7.5/10.

Ghost Rider vs Lobo (Marvel vs DC): Another good death battle. That's all I'll say. 7.5/10.

Dragonzord vs Mechagodzilla (Power rangers vs Goldzilla): A death battle I didn't care about, in the slightest, but I'll give it a 6.5/10.

 Sasuke VS Hiei (Naruto VS Yu Yu Hakusho): Read the above review for Dragonzord vs Mechagodzilla if you want my opinion on this won, but I will give it a 7/10.

Ganondorf vs Dracula (Legend of Zelda vs Castlevania): This October Death Battle, fit for Haloween, is almost perfect! And I liked the reference to ""What is a man? Nothing but a miserable pile of secrets!"" 8.5/10.

 Mob VS Tatsumaki (Mob Psycho 100 VS One Punch Man): I'll admit this one was a lil' biased, but it was a good fight, nonetheless. 7/10.

Deadpool vs The Mask (Marvel vs Dark Horse): This should have been the series finale, but this Death Battle broke the 4th wall in so many ways, it was hiliarious. 9/10!

 All Might vs Might Guy (My Hero Academia VS Naruto): Finally, the season finale: More anime! I personally didn't care who won, but the 3D animation style has definitely improved from the earlier 3D animated fights, like Joker vs Sweet Tooth, Cloud vs Link, Dante vs Baynottea, and Yang vs Tifa. 8/10.

Overall season rating: 7/10.

"Black Widow (More of a Scoop, not a theory)","Hello! I am a person who has acess many sources working with Marvel Studios  hence I'll be able to provide details regarding the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I'll be happy to provide them as soon as I get them!

So I've heard many details on the movie but I won't share everything, I'll share only  a few 

SPOILERS AHEAD 

&gt;!The main plot of the movie is stopping Melina Vostokoff from activating the Red Room Program and to stop destroying many lives of young woman!&lt;

&gt;!Taskmaster is revealed to be Mason, Natasha's former lover, who's a former shield agent!&lt;

&gt;!Melina is revealed to be bad as well but changes her mind and fights alongside black widow!&lt;

&gt;!The last fight is between Natasha vs Melina and The Red Guardian vs the Taskmaster, it'll be in a laboratory!&lt;

&gt;!While these are happening Yelena frees the captured black widows and sets the facility to explode, Melina gets locked in her own Red Room torture chamber, and she dies!&lt;

&gt;!Taskmaster kills the Red Guardian,Taskmaster is killed by Yelena, She seemingly killed him

&gt;!Not sure about this but I've heard that Downey Jr's cameo will be at the start of the movie telling her the government is going to come after her!&lt;

"Black Widow (White version, as from movie)","So I know some people might have already suggested this. But it would be really cool if we could have a white version of Black Widow, as she wares a white suit in the movie. I know the movie ain’t out yet, but that’s exactly why I am bringing it up already (again, perhaps). So you guys can start thinking about it. Because I have the Black Widow skin in Fortnite, I absolutely love it and would love it even more with a white style for it. Hope you guys look at this and think it through. Thanks for reading.

The Black Widow movie is not going to be exciting after thinking about it in hindsight,"- Since this takes place sometime after civil war and before infinity war, there's literally zero suspense we know Black Widow is going to survive any threat in her movie no matter how dire the situation will be.

- Going from powerful enemies like Malekith, Thanos, Mysterio, Galactus, it feels like a ""grounded"" threat isn't as suspenseful now at this point in the MCU. This movie is definitely long overdue.

- The plot is not going to be interesting (simply after civil war, they're on the run, right? So they are fighting fighting fighting and hiding from authorities until Thanos' arrival in 2018). We can predict everything from a mile away.

I'm really sorry if this is offensive but they REALLY should've made the black widow movie much earlier because it just can't compete in terms of scale now that Endgame/Infinity War/Thor the dark world have been released.",marvelstudios,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fieam9/the_black_widow_movie_is_not_going_to_be_exciting/,Discussion,Em_Og,fieam9,/r/marvelstudios/comments/fieam9/the_black_widow_movie_is_not_going_to_be_exciting/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fieam9/the_black_widow_movie_is_not_going_to_be_exciting/,13,2020-03-14

[M4F] - what’s your favorite TV Show?,"If this post is still up, I'm still looking.   18+ only

I'd love to set up a scene either with one (or More) characters from a show or movie. And really see if they're into the naughty things I've always imagined of them..

Or, their actress counterparts. Maybe a chance encounter with a fan. A filthy rendezvous with another Actor or crew member.  A contest, or an auction.

[Gloria](https://i.imgur.com/6T1u5FU.jpg) (Modern Family) So fucking amazingly hot. that accent, those curves, those fucking tits. You know she's nasty and freaky in bed. Willing to do anything to please the man she's with. She loves attention, and always knows that men are staring and drooling. She eats it up.

[Jackie](https://i.imgur.com/a7H40Qu.jpg) (That 70's Show) She's so spoiled. So sexy. So petite. Her parents paid for everything she wanted. But you know she had a few different Sugar Daddies on the side. And I bet she treats them extra special. And lets them do anything they want to her.

[Rachel](http://i.imgur.com/7SMEc.jpg) (Friends)  I mean, good lord. It must have been perpetually cold in that apartment. Her nipples were the real star of that show. Or maybe. She got a thrill knowing that people were looking. Maybe it got her a little wet if she caught one of her co-stars, or one of the crew looking at those perfect, perky tits.

Branching Out - A handful of reviews on a personal favorite house,"I've been around Reddit long enough to notice the trend of niche beauty subs getting stuck on repeat, passing around the same cult brands/products. Some are cult favorites for a reason, but you have to admit that it gets a bit boring when all of the swaps offer nearly the same selection or the reviews discuss the same items 50 times over...time to get a little fresh (hopefully) blood in the mix.

**AkimaBotanicals** \- Now this perfume house has been around for quite a while *(est. 2011)*, but I haven't seen it mentioned on the sub before, so I'm betting it'll be new to at least a couple of you. Their pricing is insanely reasonable and you get free shipping with orders of $35+. Most of their scents are available for all of their bath, body, and home products. They have one of my all time favorite indie scents (and daily go to) :

* ***Dragoness*** *(dragon's blood, sandalwood, rose, chocolate, patchouli)* Do you love incense and feeling invincible?  This scent is for you. The rose takes that powdery edge off of the sandalwood and leaves the sexy, sultry spiciness intact, and it lasts **all friggin day.** I get an instant confidence boost every time I put this on.

Other oils I've tried from this house include:

* ***Forest Shadows*** *(cedar, ylang ylang, dragon's blood, fresh herbs)* The herbs in this lend more to a clean scent that anything akin to herbaceous.  Bright floral and  juniper notes over a soft, earthy musk that also lasts seemingly all day.
* ***Bonfire*** (*firewood, cedar, dragon's blood* *^(&gt;.&lt; yes I have a problem)* *, rose)* No doubt about it, this is a king among smoke-infused scents. Wet: Lighter fluid and burning wood. Dry Down: Mostly smoke and the sweet scent of burning wood.  This one is intimidating to wear alone in a public setting but makes a really fun pairing with *Dragoness*.
* ***Hafla*** *(frankincense, myrrh, jasmine, violet, amber)*  Warm and comforting start, the resins are the stars. Eventually the scent be comes reminiscent of a warm cedar box that holds sandalwood incense. Unfortunately, on me the dry down resulted in that all-too-well-known baby powder scent that is a risk with incense-y varieties.
* ***Cemetery*** *(moist fresh-turned earth, trodden grass, fresh roses left to rest with the ever-sleeping)* One of the purest 'moist-earth' interpretations I've ever come across. The grass notes are present, but never overpowering, and the rose laces it's floral fingers through both notes. You are the widow lingering at the gravesite of your lover and friend. The bouquet of roses you cast upon his new mound silently gather fine droplets of mist as the overcast sky warns of the coming storm. I may be a bit biased towards this one.
* ***Earth Magick*** *(nag champa, green tea, thyme)* So you want everyone to know you're that witch that makes her own tinctures and teas? Here's your calling card. Delightfully herbaceous and earthy.
* ***Vanilla Dusk*** *(vanilla, Egyptian musk, sandalwood)* Spicy, pure vanilla. Simple, beautiful, and was a perfume I gifted to many friends after they would constantly ask to borrow my roll-on.
* ***Tattoo Parlor*** *(black leather, Egyptian musk, sage)* There is NO mistaking the black leather note in this, the musk mellows it out a bit and the sage gives it an earthy-astringent smell that plays well with the leather.
* ***Cloven*** *(clove, blackberry, vanilla, lilac)* I was so excited to try this perfume with these beautiful notes. Unfortunately, this is the one that taught me my skin LOVES to amp the clove. It was a hard way to find out I don't like cloves quite as much as my skin chemistry wants me to BE the clove.
* ***Memories*** *(nag champa, sage, oats, honey)* This is such a softly sweet and comforting oil. I enjoy wearing it to bed. The sage and nag champa keep the sweet notes grounded and prevent them from becoming gourmand, and the sweet notes mellow out the earthy notes and keep them from being to harsh.

The other house name I'd like to put out there for your consideration is **BirchAndStorm.**  I'm not *quite* sure if they count, since their line-up is based on designer scents by the likes of Tom Ford, MEMO, Le Labo, Creed, ect., ect. BUT they are oil based interpretations of these scents and I have yet to be disappointed by a purchase. They are long lasting scents that have an amazing throw, and the price is ridiculously affordable at $5 for a 5mL roll on and $7.50 for a 10mL.

Lastly, I saw a recent poster looking for indie jewelry and I have to rec the shop that made my [wedding set.](https://imgur.com/a/ij40z3z) Traci, the owner of **TazziesCustomJewelry** is incredibly accommodating and even allowed me to pick the stone I wanted set from her current stock! I would describe her work as elegantly whimsical.

Well, thanks stopping by and I hope that you all have a great weekend! I'd like to make a final shoutout to my long-lost love, ***Common Brimstone***, you are sorely missed, but it was a beautiful journey, wasn't it?  Thank you for starting me on my road to indie-hoarding and for sharing your crafty-talents!",Indiemakeupandmore,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/fiazw1/branching_out_a_handful_of_reviews_on_a_personal/,,YearOfTheSnail,fiazw1,/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/fiazw1/branching_out_a_handful_of_reviews_on_a_personal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/fiazw1/branching_out_a_handful_of_reviews_on_a_personal/,25,2020-03-14

Will SDCC be MORE exciting because of coronavirus?,"First, I wanted to say that I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. The next few weeks or more will be rough and I hope everyone is ok. Obviously many of us are worried that SDCC could be cancelled. I know I’m not the only one that would be heartbroken if it’s true. It is also very possible it won’t be cancelled, but will be far more packed than years past and not have the same level of exciting panels due to COVID concerns. I wanted to speculate about another possibility though that is probably a long shot,  it would be cool if it happened. 

Several high profile movies have been delayed and TV shows have had their productions interrupted. Bond, mulan, and many other high profile movies have been delayed. Movies like black widow and Wonder Woman have a good shot at moving too. Let’s assume the best case scenario that the cases in the US and (hopefully) around the world stagnate enough that normal life and gatherings resume in early May and that there are not many new cases that develop. At this point event companies may want to start resuming business, and the talent will feel like that with appropriate precautions it will be ok to resume sending their talent out to events.

At this point there will have been no major events to promote the industry in months. Cinema con and many other events were cancelled. People have been skipping going to the movies in large part for most of March and April because few films came out. By May many tv shows may even be in repeats because shows had their production cut for a while (this is true of broadcast I think at least, shows like supernatural and greys anatomy have suspended filming). People have been getting their entertainment from streaming, which has little ads. 

Once normal life resumes studios will want to advertise their products. Again assuming that they are ready to do this in mid May, and talent is taken care of studios could use SDCC for a major marketing blitz.   I Won’t outline all of the movies and shows that could be featured, but it was sizable even before movies like bond and fast and furious got delayed. There will be a serious need to get people hyped for things again.  Movies like bond (out in November) will need marketing resumed. SDCC being in July could be the perfect time for studios to get their products marketed.

I don’t know exactly how the studio courting by CCI works, or what the exact timeframe is, but I know they decide what studios come months in advance, and then the studios themselves decide what to bring (which I think is sometimes a very late decision). So if studios don’t drop out, or haven’t already, or if there is time to commit as late as May than there may be more of a major presence as opposed to none or a light one. If these factors align then it could be the most packed and exciting (in terms of blockbuster content) we have seen in years as the past couple of years have been relatively light. 

What do you all think? Is this possible? If you know more about the process that contradicts what I have written chime in below. This is also the most wishful thinking, best case scenario. I wanted to put it out there though as a tonic for all the “SDCC will be cancelled or no one will come” doom and gloom.",comiccon,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/comiccon/comments/fivnwk/will_sdcc_be_more_exciting_because_of_coronavirus/,SDCC - San Diego,rcdvg,fivnwk,/r/comiccon/comments/fivnwk/will_sdcc_be_more_exciting_because_of_coronavirus/,https://www.reddit.com/r/comiccon/comments/fivnwk/will_sdcc_be_more_exciting_because_of_coronavirus/,11,2020-03-15
[M4A as F] Smut Filled Celebrities / Incest / Canons,"Hey ladies, are you interested in doing a quick smutty roleplay? I've got a couple of scenes I'm craving right now... One craving involves a celebrity (maybe someone like Sarah Hyland, Megan Fox, Selena Gomez, Taylor Swift, Olivia Munn, Scarlett Johansson, Olivia Wilde, Mila Kunis, etc.) hearing a rumor that one of the workers on set of her new movie/music video has a HUGE cock and taking it upon herself to find out whether or not the rumor is true.

Another is a brother/sister pairing with her walking in on him jerking off and offering to help or something along those lines.  Mom/son would be welcomed as well.

I'm also looking for someone to play either Ariel from the Little Mermaid, Anna and Elsa from Frozen, or Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow from the MCU.

For Ariel, the idea would be that she knows she is going to lose her human bottom half, so she is very eager to prove to Prince Eric that she would still be able to satisfy him, even as a mermaid.

For Anna and Elsa, they would somehow get into an argument over who could take a big cock better. They'd get either Kristoff, Olaf (with the help of Elsa's powers), or an original character involved to judge a 'competition' between the two of them.

For Black Widow, the idea would be that she is interrogating/torturing an enemy. Rather than using pain, she would try getting him to talk using pleasure.

As far as kinks go, I'm really craving some cock worship, oral, and titfucking/outercourse. Oh and MC would have to have a huge cock (14+).

Let me know if you're interested. I'm on Skype, Kik, and Discord if that'd be preferable for you.",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fiv9i2/m4a_as_f_smut_filled_celebrities_incest_canons/,,06RSXTypeS,fiv9i2,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fiv9i2/m4a_as_f_smut_filled_celebrities_incest_canons/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fiv9i2/m4a_as_f_smut_filled_celebrities_incest_canons/,0,2020-03-15

"[M4F] I’m on the hunt for a woman who’d be interested in crafting a long term celebrity story. This won’t be sunshines and rainbows all the time. We may have disagreements, we may fight, but when push comes to shove we’ll always find our way back to each other.","Hi there, thank you for taking an interest. No matter how late you think you are, send something. All, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, **all** messages earn a response. Comments, questions, other ideas, anything is welcome. I know this is a lot but please don't feel pressured to match as much as I have.

An odd way to begin but I’d rather not waste time getting your hopes up only to realize we won’t mesh at all. If you’re looking to be treated like a Thai two cent crack whore dumpster fire, this won’t work out. I will not abuse you. I will not hit you. My arm won’t find its way up your pussy or ass. Bathroom business is one hundred percent out of the question. Incest is out of the question. Taboo in general makes me uncomfortable so I hope you can respect that. I am not poo pooing your kinks, be into whatever you want. **Now with that being said** if you yourself want that to happen to your character, by all means please do just know that I won’t. That would make an interesting plot point if we come to that arrangement. I walk into your trailer on set to surprise you and there you are getting railed by your brother?! Words will be had. I’m rambling, gonna stop now. 

Thank you for giving this a chance and a hopeful read through. Let's get to it shall we? None of the ideas or suggestions below are *we HAVE to do this this and this or I’m bored*. Suggestions, that’s all. Something that I think I should say right away is we don’t have to hit everything beat by beat or even stick to their career path. Should someone else have been WW? Black Widow? Maybe it’s Margot Robbie in True Detective and not Alexandra Daddario?

If my title isn't obvious enough I want us to create a living, breathing world full of people, places, and scenarios we overcome as a couple. Best friends, toxic friends, family members, coworkers, the fappening, #MeToo, a rape, a break in, and so on and so forth. If you'd like me to play someone of your own creation I'll happily do that, it's only fair that I be someone you desire as well.

When it comes to our starlet in question, please play them pretty close personality wise with some altercations if that interests you. Gal Gadot isn't going to be a bitch but maybe smokes, swears like a sailor, and has D's. Emma Watson isn't going to put out the first date, but is known to be a huge flirt. Jennifer Lawrence won't call me a cock out of nowhere. Scratch that, she totally would. An attitude is welcome of course but don't be a pain in the ass for the sake of being a pain in the ass. Yell at your manager for not getting you into the room for an audition, not me. I get called a useless asshole in my normal life, why would I want that here too 🤷🏻‍♀️? *Squeal little piggy man child!* N-no. Maybe that's something we work with together. ""Babe, it's just your Wendy’s order, they're not engraving your Oscar.""

Sexy time, let's talk about it. Should we tell each other our kinks now or learn about each other throughout our time together? Maybe one day we're going at it and out of nowhere you say *Pull my fucking hair daddy!... Get the zip ties baby.... Call me your fucking cock slave!.... Can I put my finger in your butt?* It doesn't have to be during sex of course, this can be something you bring up one day out of nowhere. Fantasizing about a threesome with a girlfriend of yours? Been wanting to watch me fuck one of your friends? One of my friends? Some ideas will be welcome, some won't. This could become a jealousy/cheating angle if we go down that road.

In bold are who I'm leaning towards but all are up for play time. Someone missing? Feel free to ask or suggest:

Celebrities, pornstars, wrestlers, internet personalities: Adriana Lima, Adrianne Palicki, AJ Lee, Alektra Blue, **Alexa Bliss (WWE), Alexandra Daddario**, Alice Eve, Alicia Vikander, **Alison Brie, Alison Haislip**, Allie (AEW), Allison Parker, Amanda Seyfried, **Amber Heard**, Amy Adams, **Angelina Jolie, Anna Kendrick, Anne Hathaway**, Anya Taylor-Joy, **April O'Neil, Asa Akira**, Aubrey Plaza, Ayumi Anime, Bella Thorne, **Blake Lively, Brie Larson**, Britney Spears, **Brooke Adams (Miss Tessmacher)**, Bryce Dallas Howard, **Caity Lotz**, Carice Van Houten, **Carrie Underwood**, Carter Cruise, Charlize Theron, **Chloe Bennet**, Christian Serratos, Christina Hendricks, **Daisy Ridley, Dakota Johnson, Deborah Ann Woll, Elizabeth Olsen, Emilia Clarke, Emily Bett Rickards, Emily Blunt**, Emma Dumont, Emma Stone, Emmy Rossum, Esperanza Gomez, Eva Green, **Eva Lovia**, Farrah Abraham, **Gabbie Hanna, Gal Gadot, Hailee Steinfeld, Hayden Paneteirre, Hayley Atwell**, Jaimie Alexander, Jamie Chung, Janina Gavanker, Jasmine Jae, Jenna Marbles, **Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lopez, Jessica Alba**, Jessica Biel, **Jessica Chastain, Karen Gillan**, Kate Beckinsale, Kate Mara, Kate Upton, **Katie Cassidy, Katrina Law**, Katy Perry, Kelly Kelly, **Kelsi Monroe, Kendra Sunderland**, Kristen Bell, **Lady Gaga, Lana (WWE), Lana Rhoades**, Lauren Cohan, Lea Michele, Lena The Plug, Lily James, Lindsay Lohan, Lizzy Caplan, Madison Ivy, Malin Akerman, **Mandy Moore, Margot Robbie, Maria Kanellis (WWE)**, Marisa Tomei, McKayla Maroney, **Megan Fox, Melissa Benoist, Mia Malkova**, Michelle Jenneke, Mickie James (WWE), Milana Vayntrub, Monica Bellucci, Naomi Scott, Natalie Alyn Lind, Natalie Dormer, Natalie Portman, Nathalie Emmanuel, Nicole Aniston, Nicole Scherzinger, Noelle Foley (Mick Foley's daughter), **Olivia Munn**, Oona Chaplin, **Paige (WWE), Peyton Royce (WWE)**, Rachel Brosnahan, Rachel McAdams, Reese Witherspoon, Ronda Rousey, Rose Byrne, Salma Hayek, **Sara Jean Underwood, Scarlett Bordeaux, Scarlett Johansson, Shakira**, Shantel VanSanten, Sophie Turner, Stacy Keibler (WWE), Summer Rae (WWE), Tatiana Maslany, Taynara Conti (WWE), Tenille Dashwood (WWE), Toni Storm, Torrie Wilson (WWE), Whitney Cummings. **ALL WOMEN AND CHARACTERS WILL BE 18+**

I’m very, **very** aware this post is quite vague but I’d rather give you options to play, not hogtie you down to one idea. 

Below I have some questions for you that I’d like answered. Feel free to ramble as long as you want. What’s most important is I want to know about you so if you decide *Fuck your questions I know how to introduce myself*, go for it:

1. Whom would you like to play as? Can’t nail down one celeb? Give me your top ten and we’ll go from there. Have your heart set on one name? Put her name in the title. Do you even have setups for people ready to go? Show me, I'd love to see and discuss.

2. When do you envision our story taking place? Very beginning, at your peak, or somewhere in the middle? Have we been dating or married for some time? If we're already dating I'd like to chit chat a bit about that, come up with some references so we have stuff to call back to. *Remember, remember when I fell into the pool?.... Wanna, take the limo around the corner like we did that one time?* And so on and so forth.

3. Who am I to you if not a complete stranger? Friend of a friend, blind date, neighbors, etc. Hell, am I about to get married and you're the one that stands up?

4. Kinks now or kinks in RP? If now, tell me yours.

5. PM’s here, Kik, or Discord?

6. Any movies lately? What’d you see?

7. How do you envision me? Shredded with a horse cock? Do I have a dad bod with an average dick who should be thankful he’s funny?  Am I a beautiful busty brunette or do I need a makeover at some point? What’s my job?

So what do you say? Let's get to brainstorming. If you've read this and have a setup you've been dying to get off the ground, lay it on me.",dirtypenpals,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fj8g3m/m4f_im_on_the_hunt_for_a_woman_whod_be_interested/,Long Term RP,Ricklaneng,fj8g3m,/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fj8g3m/m4f_im_on_the_hunt_for_a_woman_whod_be_interested/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/fj8g3m/m4f_im_on_the_hunt_for_a_woman_whod_be_interested/,0,2020-03-15
"Once and for all, Black Widow is not going to be released on Disney+","I know many people keep parroting but you guys have any idea how much money is placed for a theatrical film? Why would they dump BW on streaming while delay New Mutants three times? Marvel is not going to do that. They're waiting to see what happens and like Mulan, will probably delay the movie at the last minute. If they choose to release the movie on Disney+, which won't happen, they'll lose millions of dollars.

Could Phase 4 still be on schedule?,"So I know Black Widow could potentially get delayed and I’m also aware that all of these movies and shows are currently not in production, but can Marvel Studios still be on track for the 2021 releases? For instance, I’m sure movies such as Thor 4, Doctor Strange 2, and Spider Man 3 will release on time due to the fact that they’re far into 2021. Then we have Shang Chi in February which sorta looks iffy since they’re currently filming right now and treats post poned so it could be a different due date. The animated show What If should release on schedule. The Loki show could potentially have a different date since that show is currently filming at the moment but is now stopped due to the disease. Then Hawkeye should be fine seeing how they haven’t started filming yet. Falcon And The Winter Soldier could get a September or October release now due to their production being stopped. And seeing how Wandavision has finished filming, it could still come out in December since I’m sure reshoots will happen in the far future.

Marvel Phase 4 Updates (From 4chan),"http://boards.4channel.org/co/thread/113680728

Again, it most likely could be fake but I thought it was worth sharing on here anyway. 


&gt;Black Widow is getting pushed back due to Coronavirus. End Credits scene includes Jeremy Renner. 

&gt;Ajak and Sprite die in Eternals. The Phastos kiss scene has been discussed being cut but no final decisions. 

&gt;Shang Chi will introduce Fin Fang Foom. Jospeh Fiennes, Sam Claflin, and Zhang Ziyi are cast as Reston, Jack Tarr, and Leiko Wu. Michelle Yeoh plays an evil scientist named Zhang.

&gt;Cillian Murphy is in negotiations to play Nightmare in Multiverse of Madness. Emma Watson is being looked at for Clea, with Malachi Kirby in negotiations for Voodoo. Isabela Merced is cast as America Chavez. Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell have cameos. 

&gt;Spider Man 3 will be titled Home Run. Scorpion and Kraven are the main villains. Joe Keery and Jane Lynch are being looked at for roles. Henry Cavill or Jason Mamoa wanted for Kraven, but have to sign a non compete clause if interested. 

&gt;Christian Bale is playing Dario Agger in Love and Thunder. Groot and Rocket have supporting roles. Jodie Comer and Ryan Gosling are in final negotiations for roles. 

&gt;Ant Man 3 will be about Cassie leaving her family to be an Avenger, with Scott and Hope trying to stop her. MODOK is the villain. 

&gt;Micheal B Jordan is back in Black Panther 2. A List actor wanted for the villain.

&gt;Captain Marvel 2 will introduce Nova. Abigail Brand will appear. 

&gt;Blade is looking to cast many Oscar Nominees as the cast.",MarvelStudiosSpoilers,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/fj9pxm/marvel_phase_4_updates_from_4chan/,4Chan,calebcold3,fj9pxm,/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/fj9pxm/marvel_phase_4_updates_from_4chan/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/fj9pxm/marvel_phase_4_updates_from_4chan/,116,2020-03-15
No confidence in Disney to handle the legacy - Phase 4 is going to bomb,"As a geek who grew up with less than a passing interest in comic books, can a crowd of marvel lovers convince me that I have anything to be excited about for phase 4 onward?

For context, for me the real superhero will always be 80s superman form the movies. (I also loved as a wee boy all the 80s superman movies, superboy, Louis and Clark, Smallville, Superman Returns,  I was even watching the Flash and Supergirl and binged and loved the recent DC Universe Crisis crossover...)

I am still surprised at myself how much I enjoyed the Marvel Universe. Iron Man as a physics undergrad at the time as amazing, and that hooked me in for a wild ride. Shield delivers (despite repeatedly reneging on the promise to link to the MCU) and Netflix up to the Destroyers was interesting, again with the hook that these shows connect to the MCU (only for that to be dropped later on as too ambitious - this probably explains why I am only on S2 Jessica Jones, and didn't even make it to the last episode of Punisher).

The whole Phase 1 to 3 feels like it was a complete fluke that it played and paid off so well. An amazingly entertaining set of films with enough hooks to keep us (me) wanting more, including the TV shows.

After Endgame and Far from home, and the lack of pay off from Netflix and Shield connection to the MCU - it feels as though the journey with Marvel will be over.  

Reasons to say goodbye...

- Captain Marvel seems to hit the peak 'comic book' type of scifi that turns me away. Science not far enough away to just be magic, it is still selling itself as science and technology... , but it is so unrealistic/plot convenient there is no suspense. This is where the comic book legacy becomes its own downfall... so much lore and history that it becomes very much ""yeah, you are making this up as you go along now aren't you"".   With Iron Man 1 you could stretch your belief...   but by the time you have super woman/not super woman flying through spaceships with ease due to ""science"", it kinda makes the rest of the universal dangers seem pointless...  they had to basically send her away for most of Avengers Endgame otherwise she would have ruined the plot!

- Dr Strange is not out until 2021 - but there is stuff I am very likely to miss before that, so links to the MCU will be missed and I am unlikely to notice/appreciate them. Same with Spiderman 3

- I can't even remember the name of that rubbish show with heros living on the moon with a big dog or whatever it was - is that what ""The Eternals"" will be? Either that or a strained link to Thanos/Star Lords Dad  = no interest. Seems like it will be very much in the comic scifi realm where there is a huge big pitbull dog just... because.  I was astounded when Guardians of the Galaxy managed to succeed with two entertaining comedies, dialing into how ridiculous the racoon and talking tree are...  my fear is the Eternals will be like Captain Marvel and it will just expect me to take this seriously, unlike Guardians which had to work hard to earn my affection for the characters! I have the feeling that they will just expect us to care about it in the Eternals. This actually was the failing of Man of Steel/Batman vs Super Man and Justice league, also Green Lantern and the Fabulous 4...  no we (non comic book loving viewers) have no reason to care for or believe in your silly men in tights - not even Superman, so don't you dare take our connection to the characters for granted (or you will end up with a BvS and JL complete mess!).

- Black Widow is dead, so it seems strange why I should care about her back story. 

- New MCU TV stuff will be behind disney paywall and will be released weekly/monthly to bolster their subscription model - drastically decreasing my interest to follow their laboured tale.

- already the extended MCU other shows were of very poor quality., Runaways was it? and light and shadow? had extremely weak connections to the MCU and were extremely tweenie based shows as well - the fact I can't remember their name or be bothered to look them up speaks volumes.


So yeah - pretty much time to say thank you and goodbye to the MCU I think. I have my bluray discs I will rewatch at some point I am sure...  and will likely catch the new movies in 4 or 5 years time on a bundle package maybe... but the chances of me caring about Loki / Falcon / Wanda and the rest of the B teams seem very very slim. 

Or am I wrong and is there actual reason to be excited for phase 4 onward?",marvelstudios,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fj0d59/no_confidence_in_disney_to_handle_the_legacy/,,Someone2345678,fj0d59,/r/marvelstudios/comments/fj0d59/no_confidence_in_disney_to_handle_the_legacy/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fj0d59/no_confidence_in_disney_to_handle_the_legacy/,45,2020-03-15

M4F - A Super Heroines Play-Thing,"Black Widow had a secret. None of the men of SHIELD knew about it, nevermind the population. Only a few of her fellow female partners-in-crime, and surprisingly enough, some of her most outright enemies, knew.

Natasha often baited some of the younger SHIELD recruits. Once gaining their trust, she turned them into her personal play things. But only one special recruit, one who she has kept at her side for some time now, had become her permanent play-thing. One that she couldn't help but share with her closest friends. And even with the most attractive of villains that she'd come across.

The Avengers may have many enemies, but when a size queen, cock obsessed woman like Natasha meets a young SHIELD recruit cutie that knows how to satisfy, tease, and get her off in just the right way, there is no such thing as an adversary in bed who can enjoy that dick as much as her. 

She loves to share, and he loves to be shared.

Fandom Gender Changing Machine!,"I am 18+ and all partners and characters must be 18+ 

So I had an idea recently involing a rather weird kink but it would invole lots of action and adventure!  Romance and lots of smut!. 

And no you cant use ocs stop asking. 

I will stricly play male and you will play the female former male. Which means and I cannot stress this enough!  (I will not play female you will.) No futas or shemales. 

(I really want to focus on the romance as well cus I'm kind of sad and dealing with a ton.) 


The kink is feminzation transforming a gruff male into a beatiful female!. 


Plot idea: You are my male bully a mean and callus young man.. Who enjoys tormenting and pushing me around.. I am a geeky sciance nerd in love with the concepts of video games and comic books.  Almost to an insane point.. Where it prompts me to create something that could change the world.. A machine that can change and alter gender.. Thats right!  This device I have created it can alter the world we know it.. And I had created for my school sciance fair,  at least I had till one faithful day within the school gym. It was a gender changing device but I had programed it with only four apearnches.. That of my favorite all time fictional characters.  I sit within the gym tinkering with my amazing device that was until you came the local meat head.. My bully.. You began pushing me around and before I could make my adjustments you took the device turning it on causing it to explode transforming you into one of these characters.  The hearts are who I like the most.

Black widow or Huntsman? (Elites),"So I've got three usb ports I can use and I have the Basilisk Ultimate, Goliathus Chroma mouse mat and the Kraken TE so as it stands I use all the ports.

But I want to get a keyboard as I play on laptop and it would be useful for me to have a not ten keyless keyboard for general productivity and uni work.

So my question is should I go for the Blackwidow elite because it is the cheaper and I get the USB pass throughs so I would effectively have a free usb spot (is that how it works?). Or should I go for the Huntsman because either way I'll have to give up a USB port

CMV: Black Widow And Captain America Should Have Switched Endings (Avengers: Endgame Spoilers),"I think that Captain America should have sacrificed on Vormir. Maybe Falcon doesn't get dusted, he and Cap go to Vormir, and they do that same trying-to-sacrifice-themselves dance. I think this fits in really well with Cap's rule of not trading lives except for his own.

Meanwhile, Black Widow would have been perfect to lift Mjolnir. In Age of Ultron, she's the only Avenger who doesn't try, saying that's not a question she wants answered. How awesome would it have been for her to be worthy this whole time?

Rewatched endgame here's some questions I had after rewatching it!,"Some of these things are mostly just things that bother me and I already know the answers but would like your opinions on them too 😊

1 - Why wasn't Bruce/hulk in the hologram meeting with black widow. I understand this scene comes before the smart hulk reveal and wouldn't of made much sense but I also can't imagine that hulk wouldn't still be a part of the Avengers in the 5 year gap. 

2 - Why did black widow let clint/ronin kill the Asian people. She Litterally stood there and let him do it. I know the Avengers have probably killed people before especially in that age of ultron opening scene. But like this just felt weird to me. Difference between a murder spree and an Avengers mission I guess

3 - Why didn't nebula tell them about how to get the soul Stone and the sacrifice. Now I've thought that maybe she didn't know how he got the stone and about the sacrifice but later on she's like he came back with the stone and she didn't that to me hints that she at least put 2 and 2 together 

4 - Why would they think the time Stone was in new York. Now I understand they played it on a hunch but no they like seriously played it on a hunch. They thought Dr strange had the stone at that point and was in new york. I mean if Dr strange was even the famous doctor he is it wouldn't of been hard to Google or ask a hospital his whereabouts that year and realise he was still a normal doctor. Or heck even ask 1 of the sorcerers the history of the time Stone. 

5 - If going to the past created a new timeline and they travelled to 3 different pasts plus cap and ironman going again. Then wouldn't that have created 4 different time lines? Not really an issue just a thought? 

5 - If going to the past makes a new timeline then when cap returns the stones he would be doing so in a new timeline. Meaning the timeline that the ancient one says to hulk return the stones is still ruined? Hopefully that question makes sense. The time travel rules are tricky in this but from what I gather once you go back in time and change something you create a new timeline so really going back in time again wouldn't put you in the same timeline you was in before. Honestly they should of established more the multiverse theory rather then just time travel. 

7 - How does Tony know to go to 1970. He even says I know how I know. And to me that's like there's something to this?

8 - the soul Stone sacrafice. Infinity war it feels like you have to sacrafice the one you love. Like you have to be the one to push them off that cliff and actually sacrifice them. But then in endgame it's more of a you can sacrifice yourself. Now in infinity war if gamora jumped off the cliff willingly would thanos have still got the stone? I don't think so. So why does clint get the stone when black widow sacrifices herself. I understand that hawkeye kind of let's her go but she also kicks off the wall. 

10 - How did thanos get pym particles for his entire ship? I'm going to assume that one of his alien scientists managed to replicate the pym particles. 

11 - Thanos said he was gonna destroy all of the universe and then said he would enjoy earth. Like what was he planning on destroying the entire universe and just be the last survivor?! 

12 - why didn't Dr strange bring captain marvel through the portal in the end battle. Now you could say that he didn't know who she was or where she was but he wouldn't of known who the people in wakandan were or the asgardians on earth he clearly seen the future and was like right these are the people I need to bring to this battle. And he would of seen cap marvel be a key player in this fight now that makes you wonder why he didn't bring her straight away. Did he see a possible future where they lost because captain marvel was at the start of the fight? If so what messed that up. I have a theory that thanos' ship instantly stops firing on the ground and fires captain marvel. If cap marvel was there at the start she would of either took out the ship straight away or they would of fired straight at captain marvel and not the ground. Now something about that would of made them lose in a possible future. 

13 - Clint Literally says I wish I could go back and tell her it worked and I'm like you can and you can bring her back. Like that line was so stupid because he could Litterally go back in time to just before she jumps off the cliff and say it worked come with me but I guess that would mess up that's timeliness events. But still gamora is running around and I know they wouldn't do the same for the character but the fact that not one character brings it up is silly. even a throwaway line of let her rest or shes now at toned for her past she's the hero she always wanted to be. 

14 - If they needed hulk to bring back cap at the end who stayed at the base to bring back all of the Avengers from the time heist. Like it's clear during that final scene when cap goes to the past that hulk has to stay and work the machines so who did that when they all went into the past. Even past evil nebula had to use the controls to bring thanos and his ship back. But then again at the same time it's clear them controls are obsolete because the whole team travels from the past to the future without a machine in the past. I guess you could say its the anchor and you either have to be going to or from the machine but then how would Tony and cap go from 2012 to 1970 - _-

15 - If cap goes back in time and therefore creates a new timeline how does he end up in the main timeline as old cap? 


Finally this isn't really a question but the most stupidest thing in this film is that bloody Rat!!!

The fact that the only reason scot got out was because a rat accidentally presses a keyboard loses me. I can forgive all of the time travel shenanigans because they at least try to explain it but the rat is too much of a coincidence. Like way too much. It should of been cassie going through her dad's stuff maybe hinting that she was making a stature suit.

Anyway do you agree with my list. Did anything stick out for you.

"Something is slowly coming for me, and it has been more than a year.","After my grandpa's death back in November, the only thing that kept me in one piece was my last year at uni. I finished uni in December 15th, and in the subsequent days depression, grief and anxiety attacks were slowly but surely becoming more frequent. 

I had this custom of having a little 20 min nap at 4pm to get more energies for the night. Usually I woud go for a walk in the steets, have a beer or two, call out a friend to talk, anything to keep my mind off the anxiety, sometimes I'd play Pokémon GO just to not be at home.

December 29th, 2018

I had just gotten back home at 11pm. Said goodnight to mom, asked her about my brother, he was going to be at a friend's house after work (he works from 2pm to 10:30 pm at a gas station). I went to my room and jumped into bed, hoping that the two beers I had would be enough to make me sleep quickly. I did.

December 30th, 2018

Hours later, 2:00 in the morning to be precise. I feel very uneasy, like some sort of pain you have when you get the flu, I slowly wake up, and the weight from my own body makes me roll over face up. The only thing I remember is looking at some dark figure in the empty corner of my room. I keep looking at it, and I fell asleep again. 

Hours later, I remembered this encounter, I told my mother, she dismissed it but I wasn't ok with the answer. I thought for a second I could ask my granny, but it would've been in bad taste to ask a widow about this more than a month after his husband's (my grandpa) death. I keep it for myself.

Some friends call me at night, telling me they have a lot of beers, I invite them over. We have a good time, we finished all the beers, I give them money to get more, almost all of them go outside to buy, except for a girl. I make small talk with her, she reluctantly responds, we were talking about a movie she saw, but in a moment of clarity, she puts a straight face and tells me that she feels something uneasy (she likes spiritual thingys, planet alignment and shit), then she points at my room, more precisely, the direction the empty corner would be. I was taken aback, but my friends rang the doorbell. We exvhanged looks, I tell her that I wanted to talk about that with her afterwards. Of course we couldnt because I got hammered.

Hours later, I get to my room. I barely make it to my bed, and I slept.

December 31st, 2018

I woke up with an awful hangover. I change my clothes, put on some fresh underwear and some gym shorts. I go to my mirror to admire the piece of shit state I was and I notice a bruise in my chest, close to my shoulder, asked my friends if I fell or had a fight, they told me everything was fine with me. They asked if I was up for a New Year's dinner later that day. Told them my brother was going to be out and my mother too, so we could have drinks at my place right after. They accepted. 

Throughout the day I felt some pain in the area where the bruise was. It wasnt the regular pain you get by pressing. it was pulsating, like it was in sync with my heartbeat or with every step I took. I dismissed it as just the motion of my arms or body.

The big night came up, we had dinner at my friend's house, which is two blocks from mine, we had a good time, we talked a lot, for a moment I forgot about the pain, I forgot about the figure. I sat next to the girl, we will call her Kelly. Kelly was a little more open to me, she was laughing while we talked about random stuff. We finished the meal at 10:30, and my friends decided to go get some snacks, booze and the New Year's paraphernalia they had, I told them I was going home to get it ready. Kelly agreed to help me, and we went home. As soon as we got home, she asked me if I wanted to talk about last time, I said yes and sat on the couch, she basically told me that she felt some sort of black entity in the spot that she pointed at. I told her about the night I saw the figure, she told me to be very careful with it, that she would help me in case things got bad, I thanked her, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, then smiled, she said it was for good luck. Minutes later my friends arrived, we got it ready for 12:00 am.

January 1st, 2019

The amount of booze amazed me, I was drinking moderately, but my friends were drinking their souls out. I went to my room to change clothes, got some shorts and a tanktop. When I was putting my shorts in one feet I feel a soft push, right in the area the bruise was, it made me fall onto the bed, I panicked, finished putting my shorts and grabbed the tanktop, while getting out of the room quickly. Kelly was about to go up the stairs, she asked me if anything was wrong, then she pointed at my chest, she got closer to me and the bruise was strongly pulsating, she put her fingers on the bruise and I felt it burning, I groaned a little bit, she told me to close the door to my room, I obliged. We got back to the party. 

Two hours later, everyone was hammered, I told my friends that they were welcome to stay the night and the morning if they wanted, I turned off the music and went to talk with Kelly while we made some chicken nuggets. She told me that she felt my fear, I broke down and hugged her, asked her if I could crash at her place until 6 am. She told me that she couldnt, but she could spent the remainder of the night with me if I wanted. 

We went into the guest room (which I had never used before, only to store my bike), we slept in the big bed, nothing sexual happened, she was only rubbing my chest, telling me to calm down, I told her about my anxiety attacks, my depression, she told me this entity could be feeding off it, feeding off my dread, because all she felt when she got into my housefor the first time was pitch black. We fell asleep together. 

It was 6:30 am, we got up and started picking everything up, cleaning the living room. My friends started waking up one by one, we said goodbye to every one of them, until we were alone, Kelly told me to get some sleep in the guest room, she kissed me good luck again. I was in the living room, walking to the guest room to get said rest, but decided to go to my room, I liked my bed better than the other bed. I fell asleep like never before, thinking I would be left alone.

Hours later my brother came home, he told me that all he could hear were moans, deep moans from my room, he though I was with somebody when he saw something in top of me, but then he noticed the pitch black thing with one hand in my chest, all I could feel at that moment was the burning sensation, like being branded. My bother came up to me because the figure was gone in the blink of an eye, he woke me up, I came to my senses, asked him what happened, he told me what he saw, then he pointed at my chest, the bruise had a more intense dark purple color.

We told mom when we got home, she said she would ask somebody for help, fyi she is Catholic. Hours later she comes back with a wooden cross depicting a cucified Jesus Christ, she told me she got it blesses at the local church, and that, if things got worse, the priest would come here to check things out. I'm an atheist, but at tyhat moment I told her 'whatever it takes', she put it in a concealed space in my room, to not bother me because of my lack of belief in religion.

Fortunately, things got better that night, and the next, and the next. I eventually told Kelly what happened, she was pleased that everything was fine, I noticed that the bruise was beginning to fade. Kelly told me she wasn't feeling uneasy when she came to my home. We became good friends.

March 14th, 2020

I woke up at night, my puppy was crying, I grabbed him and laid it next to me so we could sleep together. Hours later I woke up, but I felt some sort of pressure in my chest, fearing the worst I looked where the cross was supposed to be at. It wasn't.",nosleep,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fj79s9/something_is_slowly_coming_for_me_and_it_has_been/,,DreamGenie345,fj79s9,/r/nosleep/comments/fj79s9/something_is_slowly_coming_for_me_and_it_has_been/,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/fj79s9/something_is_slowly_coming_for_me_and_it_has_been/,0,2020-03-15

Update on where all MCU Production stands as of now,"Black Widow- 

Still Scheduled to come out May 1st. It is uncertain wether or or not it will keep its release date. I wouldn't expect Disney to move it until sometime in April. As of right now, expect it to move. Now the question is where. For some reason people think that they will put it on Disney Plus and people can pay like 50$ to watch it, honestly I'd be down and the way things have been this crzy week a wouldn't rule it out. I have a strong feeling that they could push it to July or August. July is pretty crowded with Minions 2 and Free Guy the first weekend July 3rd,  Ghostbusters Afterlife and Purge 5 on the 10th, Tenet on the 17th, Jungle Cruise and French Dispatch on the 24th and on the 31st is Morbius. If they were to to drop it in July it would be on the 3rd or 10th, Disney doesn't want Jungle Cruise too close to it. August is a but safer, just has to be a little after Morbius. Also could help with F&amp;TWS coming that month, speaking of that..

The Falcon and the Winter Soldier- has maybe like 2-3 weeks left of shooting, They were shooting in Prague but got sent back after a week. Marvel is reportedly taking at least a 2 week pause on production which will likely be more than that. It is unclear wether they will go back to Prague or just shoot on a soundstage in Atlanta. Still Scheduled to come out in August, I would say it's safe to say it will stay or maybe go moved back to September. Can't get moved back too far because it finishes airing when Mandalorian debuts in October and that finishes airing When WandaVision airs in December. 

Eternals

Will highly likely stay for November release. Unless Disney decides to push each film back a bit and BW comes out then which won't happen. As with all Marvel Films, they have reshoots and additional filming, it is unclear if and when these will occur and in what capacity. They filmed in Europe, in England, Canary Islands and Spain. My guess if any reshoots do happen, it will be in Atlanta or LA.

WandaVision

This is weird. There were pictures of a Wrap party but i guess they are still apparently in production? Maybe additional or reshoots but anyway. The production in Atlanta has been delayed for at least 2 weeks. Series is supposed to air in December. It WILL come out then. 

Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings

Has been shooting for about a month and half or so down in Australia. The director isolated himself after testing for the virus (no word on it yet) suspending the first unit but the secondary unit has continued to shoot. It will probably be put on pause. I think that it will Stay in for February 2021 release unless Disney decides to move Mulan into that slot which I doubt

Loki

Has been shooting for a bit now in Atlanta. Its production was put on pause, I saw on a report for 4 weeks. The series is supposed to air in early 2021. Should stay on track for that.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness

Will Start shooting in May in London. No changes as of yet.

Spider Man 3

Tom Holland recently said that the third movie will start in July in Atlanta, they are also supposed to shoot in New York, Los Angeles and Iceland. No changes as of yet. 

What If..?

Will Stay on for 2021 release. I put it on here because of this. I think Disney should release something just to help us through this time. I think releasing an episode of F&amp;TWS is a little to much. How bout they release one ep of this show? Disney has been making moves to help us out like they moved up Rise of Skywalker home release and Frozen 2 wasn't supposed to come to D+ until the summer but they added it last night. Honestly it isn't t crazy to think they could do this

Hawkeye and Ms. Marvel

These shows are supposed to start shooting in Atlanta in July/August. No changes as of yet

Thor Love and Thunder

Will begin to shoot in August in Australia and will also have some filming in Vancouver. No changes as of yet

She Hulk and Moon Knight

Will likely start shooting late 2020 when both Ms. Marvel and Hawkeye wrap up production maybe like October/November. Unclear if they will be 2021 releases or not but don't rule them out

Phase 5 alleged production starts

Micheal Douglas said in an interview that Ant Man 3 will film in January, said shooting will be in London

Martin Freeman said in an interview that Black Panther 2 will film in Early 2021, some reports said Australia

There were reports that Gotg vol 3 will film in early 2021 once Gunn gets a pretty much finished cut of Suicide Squad by Oct/Nov. Gunn would finish production in May and finish up anything left to do on SS which releases July or August 2021",marvelstudios,1,,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fj2bem/update_on_where_all_mcu_production_stands_as_of/,,jackramz,fj2bem,/r/marvelstudios/comments/fj2bem/update_on_where_all_mcu_production_stands_as_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/fj2bem/update_on_where_all_mcu_production_stands_as_of/,18,2020-03-15
Hypothetically what would an updated MCU slate look like following a Black Widow delay?,"Assuming Black Widow gets pushed back 6 months minimum. If not more. I could see something like this.

Black Widow - November 2020

The Eternals - February 2021

Shang-Chi - May 2021

Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness - July 2021

Thor Love and Thunder - February 2022

Spider-Man 3 - July 2022 - Spider-Man is a tricky one. Any delay would require co-ordination with Sony. They could in theory take Thor's release in November 2021.

Imagine if Endgame was releasing this year in April? :o,"I bet every single one of us would of been pissed of if that was the case. Endgame would of been delayed for sure and that would of been bad for the fact that it was the most anticipated movie of all time. To add on to that, Endgame wouldn’t of been number 1 in the box office due to the corona ruining the sales. Even if Disney were to release the film on schedule, Corona still would of been bad so most of the MCU fans or the casual audience wouldn’t go out to see the film.

[Futa4A] Meeting a futa celeb,"This is intended for a short term, celeb futa, one off RP. 

**Settings:**

**1**. You and I are long term friends that meet up after a long time. I come back to your place in our hometown right as a snowstorm begins and I end up having to spend the next day or two in your place as the roads are out of operation. It is only after a few hours that you come to learn of my secret, the one that I had been hiding from you for a long time. Your character can have a secret too, whatever it may be, regardless of your gender that you have long hidden from me and comes into the open only now.  

**2**. You are staying at a motel for a single night and you cannot sleep because of the loud sounds of sex coming through the thin walls. Frustrated, you get up and think about walking over to ask them to keep it down but it ends just as you get out of your door. You see a man leave the next room and a very familiar face peek through the gap in the door, pay him and wave goodbye. You know that face well enough and suddenly, you cannot sleep at all. You just need to find out if you would be able to get your favorite celeb, sloppy seconds though she may be. Surely, it is worth a shot at least.

**3**. You find yourself in a small but very lively bar in a rural area as you are making the trip from one city back to your hometown for Christmas. Things do get a little surreal when you think you spot me dancing in the crowd with no one else seeming all the wiser to my presence. After all, the presence of a celeb in such a rural area was not quite realistic. But when I take a break from the dancing, you see an opportunity to come over and see for yourself if I am just a look alike that is fooling your eyes in the strobing lights or I am the real deal. I am thinking of this a quickie in a back alley type situation between a celeb and a fan.

**4**. Costume party where everybody is wearing one of those fancy eye masks that do not fully conceal the identity. It is supposed to be a secretive club of sorts in a mansion. Think of something similar to the scenes from Eyes Wide Shut. When you recognize who I am, you decide to make an approach and see if the night will work out.

**5**. You play the part of a new hire at the celeb's place and end up finding out about her secret while doing your job. Or the alternative would be to play a housekeeper in a resort/hotel that she is staying at. Either way, a chance discovery leads to awkwardness and a quick roll around in the hay sack.

Why does MCU Task Master shoot so weird?,"In the trailer for the upcoming Black Widow movie, it introduces the supervillain Task Master, and in the trailer you can see him drawing and aiming a bow. At first look everything seems fine, hes holding the bow in his left, and hes got an ok anchor, but if you look close, the arrow is on the right side of the bow, not the left.
