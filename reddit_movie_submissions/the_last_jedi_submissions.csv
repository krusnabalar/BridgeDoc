The Last Jedi Tickets Presale Megathread,"**TICKETS ARE LIVE!! BUY!! BUY!! BUY!!**

It’s almost that time fellow fans!
This is the official ticket MegaThread that the mods have been awesome enough to help put in place.
Throughout the evening Ill do my best to post any new and relevant information or summaries of updates provided by everyone else pertaining to the ticket release here, including:

- Actual time the tickets go online for the masses
- Tracking what apps/services are up, which ones are slow, and which ones are just plain dead
- Areas sold out and % of tickets left overall

Etc etc....

I cant do it alone, so please don’t hesitate to post your experiences and tips that may help others!
Good luck to everyone!

BE AWARE THAT IF YOU WANT AN OPENING SHOW THERE ARE MULTIPLE OPTIONS! Check your theater for all of these listing types to make sure you're getting the opening/premiere showing you want.

There's currently the standard THE LAST JEDI listing, the double header (episode 7 and 8), marathons of all films, then the Last Jedi Fan Event.

**WHAT WE KNOW NOW:**

Tickets go on sale after the trailer premieres. There is no set time for this but the game will start at approximately 815pm EST.
Be aware that last year, tickets inexplicably went online a full hour early. I personally had mine purchased at 730pm EST. So be vigilant.

Also as requested by the mods, here is a link to the Haircut of the Month club!

**Update curtesy of droidroid**

UK People
My info applies to Cineworld only. Officially we're stating that tickets go on sale at 7am but we were instructed to put them up for sale from 23:30 tonight. Expect to see tickets for some sites appearing soon online. 

**UPDATE 2**
Warning!! Director of TLJ warns there are minor spoilers in the newest trailer playing during the game - I know this isn't the trailer thread but fair warning.

**UPDATE 3** *Fandango tickets are ""live"" and allow you to select seats but don't allow you to check out!*

**UPDATE 4** *Fandango and Regal Websites/Apps are holding strong! We haven't given them the hug of death this time it seems.  Both sites are still loading for me.  No word on areas sold out yet.*

**UPDATE 5** AMC THEATER USERS! Use the AMC service! Fandango doesn't appear to be properly servicing that theater chain!!

**UPDATES 10 Oct**

Word on fandango fan shop? Store appears down.

Is this a safe place for a nervous EU fan to confide in others?,"Hello friends,

I am nervous about Eposide VIII. I don't want to rant, or complain, I just want some other old score Star Wars fans to talk to. Some people who understood what it was like when Star Wars stopped being in the pop culture and lived on the page, a few windows 98 games, and in our imagination.
  I am nervous for two reasons. The ethics of Star Wars, and my boyhood hero and idol Luke Skywalker. Since the closing moments of VII I have waited to see Jedi Master Luke in his full power. Standing up for harmony, tranquility, and the Jedi and returning balance and justice to the universe. I followed his exploits in Heir to the Empire, Shadows of the Empire, even all the way up to Star Wars Legacy when he was a force ghost.  I loved all these things, but of course, i yearned to see him on the screen. The lv 20 mythical leader Luke - the one who brought balance to the force after all. 
  What I fear - is Star wars will become postmodernist. The Jedi will be treated like a dogma, instead of a metaphysical order. Luke will be jaded and cynical, and things will turn a faded shade of grey. Will they even give him a death worthy of his nature - or will it be a simple cliche ""if you strike me down"" moment? 
  This hurts my boyhood visions, but it also makes me sad for Lucas. He made Star Wars to combat the cynical 70's films, and show that the old hero myth could be reforged into something bright and inspiring. And he sure fucking proved his point. 

I just don't want that to die. In Star Wars legacy it was hard for Cade to see the light. It was hard for him to understand that the dark side was malicious and that it really mattered if you listened to the Jedi Code or not. It was hard for him to see past the darkness, cynicism, drugs, hate, and death..but he did. And that is what Star Wars is about in the end - the light shining in the big blackness of Space.
.....I just want to see Luke holding the torch one last time...even if he is only there to hand it to Rey.

Thanks for listening friends.

"How bad can a despair be, anyway?","So, ive been GMing for a group for about 10 months now, and we just had a very interesting couple of sessions that were kicked off entirely from just one very, very bad roll.  I figured id tell people about our interesting story, and see if anyone else had some to share as well!

For background setting - takes place in 2000BBY, 3 characters are members of the jedi order, one is a loner survivalist, one is a bounty hunter and the last is a th0t (former twilek slave dancer who is force sensitive).  The sith have risen up, made an alliance with several Hutt cartels, and have launched a multi-front invasion of the Republic.

Our Twi'lek, Shaida, had her sister kidnapped, and our group finally had the means and story opportunity to track down the sister and rescue her.  One character was using seek, and the NPC astromech was making astrogation checks.  Since this was a complicated way of trying to narrow down where this kid was in the whole galaxy, and i was trying to wrap several weeks of hyperspace jumps up into one roll, i decided to make it just one fairly difficult roll.  2 yellow, 2 green vs 3 red 2 purple.  Poor little astromech rolled 2 despairs, but -succeeded- on the roll.  Note that this will be a common situation we find ourselves in.

So, they passed but something awful happens.  Well, i decided that now would be a fantastic time to drop some PLOT in, and our group finds themselves in a bizarre system made of one star, two black holes, and their hyperdrive system completely blows out. Nestled right in the middle of all these competing gravity wells is a single dwarf planet, barren of all life, covered in a fine dust, but somehow still managed to hold an atmosphere.  Cue extremely difficult piloting check for our bounty hunter to fly their medium freighter in.  5 yellow and 1 green to 4 red 1 purple 1 black (handling).  Bounty Hunter gets a despair, but passes the roll.  They manage to make it into the planets atmosphere but burn out their thrusters fighting the gravity from the star and two black holes.  Freighter is flying in, unpowered, everyone is thinking its about to be a team party kill.  Loner survivalist (with 4 force rating), uses Move with pretty much every point, light side and dark side, going into silhouette increase.  Manages to stop the ship meters from a deadly impact.  Tensions are high but the party is ecstatic.

Party starts investigating bizarre planet.  Find massive, starship sized trap door in the planets crust.  They descend into the planet to find it is a Rakatan factory, and the Guardian jedi character decides to plug his computer brain into said factory.  Factory is being controlled by Rakatan AI/Holocron personality, and was used to build a large, planet killing device that the Sith had stolen several years previously.Several incredibly difficult Discpline checks are made between the Guardian and Rakatan AI, of which he passes ALL, but gets a despair on his last check when he unplugs.  We decided the most logical course of action was a fragment of the AI's personality was now permanently residing inside the Guardian, and he would gain 1 conflict per game just from its corrupting influence!  The story/humor opportunities from this despair just keep on giving.

They decide to destroy the planet, after forcing the AI (out of sheer personal preservation) to build them a new hyperdrive for their freighter.  They plant proton torpedoes inside the AI matrix and inside power plants, get in their freighter, and one last, really awful roll for the bounty hunter to make to fly them out of there.  Three despairs, but he passes the roll.  As the planet is exploding around them, they collide with a mountain of rock and take 5 damage per despair to the ship but manage to make it out of the atmosphere, and on to the rest of the galaxy where they will more than likely continue hunting Sith in a failing-up sort of way!

Predicting the 2017 Studio Total Gross,"**7th: Paramount (Viacom)** with $520M-$550M and 5.5% of the market share

-So far Paramount made $407 million with 5% of the market share and their top 5 films are: Monster Trucks ($33 million), Ghost in the Shell ($41 million), xXx: Return of Xandar Cage ($45 million), Baywatch ($58 million), and their supposed billion dollar franchise movie that blew up in their face and under-performed, Transformers: The Last Knight ($130 million)

-Their upcoming films are Suburbicon, Daddy's Home 2, and Downsizing

-Suburbicon and Downsizing should each make at least $20 million while Daddy's Home could make at least $70 million. 

-2017 is Paramount's worst year since 2004 (Paramount made $628 million in 2004) and their worst year for the last decade (their lowest besides 2017 was in 2015 with $675 million). Comparing 2017 to 2016 for Paramount, Paramount did a lot worse this year than last year since Paramount had Jack Reacher: Never Go Back ($59 million), 10 Cloverfield Lane ($72 million), TMNT 2 ($82 million), Arrival ($92 million), and Star Trek Beyond ($159 million) last year which performed better than this year's top 5.

**6th: Lionsgate** with $850M-$880M and 8.7% of the market share

-So far Lionsgate made $650 million with 8% of the market share and their top 5 films are: The Shack ($57 million), The Hitman's Bodyguard ($75 million), Power Rangers ($85 million), John Wick: Chapter 2 ($92 million), and La La Land ($120 million)

-Their upcoming films are My Little Pony: The Movie, Tyler Perry's Boo 2! A Madea Halloween, Jigsaw, Last Flag Flying, and Wonder

-Tyler Perry's Boo 2! A Madea Halloween could make about $80 million. Jigsaw and Wonder could each make about $40 million. Last Flag Flying could make about $20 million. My Little Pony the Movie could make about $20 million.

-2017 could be Lionsgate's 3rd best year since their rise in popularity in 2012 as a film studio with the release of the Hunger Games and Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2. While the results won't be as good as their results from 2012 and 2013, it should be better than how they were faring from 2014-2016. Comparing 2017 to 2016 for Lionsgate, Lionsgate did a lot better than last year since Lionsgate had Now You See Me 2 ($65 million), Allegiant ($66 million), Hacksaw Ridge ($67 million), Boo! A Madea Halloween ($73 million), and La La Land ($151 million) last year which performed worse than this year's top 5.

**5th: Sony/Columbia** with $980M-about $1B and 10.1% of the market share

-So far Sony made $795 million with 10% of the market share and their top 5 films are: Smurfs: The Lost Village ($45 million), The Dark Tower ($51 million), The Emoji Movie ($85 million), Baby Driver ($108 million), and their billion dollar franchise movie, Spider-Man Homecoming ($333 million)

-Their upcoming films are Only the Brave, Roman J. Israel, Esq., The Star, All the Money in the World, and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle

-Only the Brave, Roman J. Israel, Esq., and All the Money in the World could each make at least $20 million. The Star could make at least $60 million. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle could make at least $100 million. 

-2017 could be Sony's first year since 2014 (Sony made $1.3 billion in 2014) where they could make at least $1 billion (or barely cross it in this case). Comparing 2017 to 2016 for Sony, Sony did a lot better than last year since Sony had The Magnificent Seven ($93 million), Sausage Party ($98 million), Passengers ($100 million), The Angry Birds Movie ($108 million), and Ghostbusters ($128 million) last year which performed worse than this year's top 5 (mostly because of Spider-Man Homecoming, Baby Driver, and the Emoji Movie).

**4th: 20th Century Fox** with $1.2B and 12% of the market share

-So far Fox made $1.1 billion with 13% of the market share and their top 6 (since 5 and 6 are very close to each other) films are: Captain Underpants ($73.9 million), Alien: Covenant ($74.3 million), War for the Planet of the Apes ($146 million), Hidden Figures ($167 million), Boss Baby ($175 million), and Logan ($226 million)

-Their upcoming films are Murder on the Orient Express, Ferdinand, The Post, and the Greatest Showman

**3rd: Universal (NBCUniversal)** with $1.6B and 16% of the market share

-So far Universal made $1.36 billion with 17% of the market share and their top 5 films are: Sing ($117 million), Split ($138 million), Get Out ($175 million), and their two biggest franchises with their own movies, The Fate of the Furious ($226 million), and Despicable Me 3 ($262 million).

-Their upcoming films are Happy Death Day, The Snowman, Thank You for Your Service, and Pitch Perfect 3

-Thank You for Your Service could make about $20 million. Happy Death Day and the Snowman could each make about $30 million. Pitch Perfect 3 could make about $200 million

-Comparing 2017 to 2016 for Universal, Universal did better this year than last year since Universal had The Purge: Election Year ($79 million), Ride Along 2 ($91 million), Jason Bourne ($162 million), Sing ($270 million), and The Secret Life of Pets ($368 million) last year which makes it possible that 2017 Universal can surpass 2016.

**2nd: Warner Bros (Time Warner) (currently in 1st place)** with $2.1B and 20.9% of the market share

-So far Warner Bros made $1.6 billion with 20% of the market share and their top 5 films are: Kong: Skull Island ($168 million), The LEGO Batman Movie ($176 million), Dunkirk ($187 million), It ($291 million), and Wonder Woman ($412 million).

**1st: Disney (currently in 2nd place)** with $2.7B and $25.9% of the market share

-So far Disney made $1.4 billion with 17% of the market share and their top 5 films are: Rogue One ($124 million), Cars 3 ($152 million), Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Men Tell No Tales ($173 million), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ($390 million), and Beauty and the Beast ($504 million).

-Their upcoming films are Thor: Ragnarok, Coco, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

-Coco could make about $130 million. Thor:Ragnarok could make about $320 million. Star Wars: The Last Jedi could make about $850 million.

-Comparing 2017 to 2016 for Disney, Disney did slightly worse this year than last year (Disney made $3B last year) since Disney had Zootopia ($341 million), The Jungle Book ($364 million), Captain America: Civil War ($408 million), Finding Dory ($486 million), and Rogue One ($532 million) last year which performed better than this year's top 5 (though none of them can beat Star Wars: The Force Awakens with $937 million).

EDIT: Forgot about Blade Runner 2049 and My Little Pony the Movie.

Reviews seem to suggest Regal's Maui Mall is the best theater, but checking the seat maps on fandango, it seems kind of small.  

We'd prefer to see the movie on the largest screen possible, as long as the theater is in reasonable shape. 

Thanks for your help!",maui,4,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/75bmoo/hello_all_whats_the_best_movie_theater_to_watch/,,pleasefeedthedino,75bmoo,/r/maui/comments/75bmoo/hello_all_whats_the_best_movie_theater_to_watch/,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/75bmoo/hello_all_whats_the_best_movie_theater_to_watch/,8,2017-10-09

Say Something! Hurts to say this...,"After seeing TB's video about the progression system. It made me realize that EA is EA. A company, a company that makes money. A lot of illusions under the hood of the game through its marketing and trailers is one the smartest and impressive things I've ever seen.

I want this game to succeed, the gameplay is really fun, but everything business around it is one of the shadiest things I'ver ever seen. I want the community to give feedback rather than accept this.

Marketing:
We all knew Battlefront I was going to be a success. Being released aligned with ""The Force Awakens"" is a really smart business decision. No amount of maps or the amount of content wasn't really spoken of. One of the most hyped games I remember during that year, it sold around 12 million copies: Reaching almost a billion dollars. 

Battlefront I:
Dice Games on average are around 120 million dollars to make. So with this money being chump change, there are no excuses for having a season pass or microtransactions for long-term development. It's just to keep those investors investing baby. Battlefront II (2005) being one of our many nostalgia boners, couldn't resist. With so many people buying into the really impressive graphics and trailers, it sold extremely well. But for us most of us consumers, it fell flat. (For the general public, good for you if you enjoy it)

Battlefront II:
""Improving on the last Battlefront""
The Trailer really got me hooked on this next game, but when you compare the second game in the series, what do you compare it to? The first one. Align with the Last Jedi, and showing off the impressive trailer really got people talking.

""What is EA doing this time, since they have no season pass?""
Get crates and use them to get star cards for upgraded abilities, Mr. Boyega didn't say BUY them which would be extremely stupid, and he added: you can craft them while playing. Not the cards: but CRATES

So if your lucky enough if you get something useful or maybe a rey mvp stance. I have browsed the subreddit and when people get worried about them, a majority of people would say,

""There not that overpowed. And you can craft them. Plus, its better than a season pass.""

Gaining scrap to get weapons to get a weapon(According to the beta) takes a tremendous amount of time and luck. It bothers me that all weapon, hero unlocks are all based on luck. I  mainly play specialist, but my officer is level 10 based on the star cards I get, not if I played him or not. Through crates.

Removing the Season Pass, made me hyped for Battlefront II again, but that is all part of the plan. One star card made Boba Fett INVINCIBLE when using his jetpack. And with more cards upon release, it worries me.

With EA being a major slice in the games industry and making BILLIONS, they have no excuse to put in these business models but for plainly just business. 

Seeing Freemium Mobel games slowly seep into full 60 dollar Triple AAA titles is extremely worrying for the industry in the future. I hope EA changes this since people are finally realizing that is P2W. 

Microtransactions for Long Term development is complete utter nonsense in a 60 dollar game, especially in this calibur, P2W. Overwatch with crates is kind of bullocks too but at least it doesn't effect my gameplay, since its cosmetic. But with Battlefront II, and seeing the amount of buffs you get really worries me. When EA is making this type of money there just isn't an excuse.

Don't just accept this since you love the game. If you truly want this game to succeed. 
STAND UP AND TELL THEM, NO EXCUSES 

24:25 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMDGPSWWA18 A great game made by passionate artists and creators. Ruined by people who need that extra money.

"Can people with more knowledge explain the relationship between studio and marketing, especially with tentpole franchises.","It is one aspect of filmmaking I've never really knew much about but with the recent tweet from Rian Johnson advising people to not watch The Last Jedi trailer that will be released tonight due to spoilers, it has made me think about how far removed filmmakers are from how their film is marketed.


For Star Wars, who is in charge of marketing? Is it Disney's marketing department? Is it Lucasfilms? Do the producers/directors have any input into trailers?


I know it clearly works differently with how big of a movie is expected to be in regards to how marketing is handled but with a tweet like that I can't help think of trailers for films like Super 8 or Finchers Dragon Tattoo.


JJ made that trailer himself. I know the production company was his own so he probably had more control over how the marketing worked for it but it still got people excited.


Fincher even cut his trailer himself. Again, it isn't star wars but it was a studio film, right?


More than anything I was just wondering how these dynamics work in the industry. Rian Johnson likes the trailer that will be released tonight but his comments also show he has very little if no input at all.",movies,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/75bu65/can_people_with_more_knowledge_explain_the/,,ED_ofthe_DEAD,75bu65,/r/movies/comments/75bu65/can_people_with_more_knowledge_explain_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/75bu65/can_people_with_more_knowledge_explain_the/,2,2017-10-09

**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Furi, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

"[H] Games on Demand (PUBG, Divinity OS 2, Cuphead), Rocket League, Life is Strange, Metro Redux, Rust, Wolfenstein Games, Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Darkest Dungeon, FTL, Rogue Legacy, Portal 2, Over 900 games/DLC/Software [W] Rise of the Tomb Raider, Any Humble Gift Links / Steam Gifts Offers","----  
**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Furi, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Furi, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

The Legends of Luke Skywalker Summary,"The book doesn't come out until the end of the month, but it got an early release at NYCC. I thought I'd post a summary of it for anyone who doesn't want to wait.

The book opens with the Rey quote from TFA about her thinking Luke is a myth. On the Wayward Current, bound for Canto Bight, crew members tell stories about Luke Skywalker. The first one is about an engineer in a bar on Xu’hu giving a comical ‘truthful’ retelling of A New Hope after being prompted by a hooded figure. After the story is finished, the hooded figure turns out to be Luke. It’s set some time after he disappears from the public eye, but it isn’t specified when.

The next story is Luke on Jakku from the point of view of an Imperial who served on a Star Destroyer. He tells an impossible story of Luke dispatching capital ships in space with his lightsaber and the Force. After the Imperial’s Star Destroyer crashes, he is recovered from the wreckage by a mysterious figure who drags the wounded Imperial across the desert, picking up salvage from the battle and searching for other survivors. The Imperial begins to suspect that it’s Luke and attempts to escape, but the figure finds him and tells him that if he tries to run he’ll die in minutes. The figure wears clothes noted to look like Luke’s and talks about growing up in another desert. The figure tells the Imperial that he plans to deliver the Imperial to an Imperial stronghold beyond the dunes. They reach the stronghold, but it has been cleared of all traces of Imperials by now. The Imperials abandoned it during the battle and blew up everything, including laboratories, to erase all traces of what the facility had been. The two stay there, trading with passing scavengers. The Imperial becomes certain that the figure is Luke after he rescues the Imperial and a group of scavengers from a disaster caused by a reactor leak from a crashed Star Destroyer, but the man doesn’t confirm the theory and gives the Imperial a homing beacon to call the Empire before leaving. The Empire tells the Imperial that Luke Skywalker wasn’t anywhere near Jakku and throws him out for being a traitor, so the Imperial returns to Jakku and becomes a scavenger, now having faith in Luke.

Next, an escaped stowaway slave tells a story set on the faraway oceanic world of Lew’el. A young pair of twins, native Lew’elans, hunt for food to feed their village. A strange foreigner saves the girl, Aya, from a storm that kills the girl’s mount. The man had come to Lew’el to study with the natives, having heard ancient tales of their strange connection to the ‘Tide.’ The man quotes Yoda’s “Do. Or do not. There is no try.” to one of the elders. He says that he has traveled the Galaxy seeking others sensitive to the ‘Tide’ and understanding of its ways. The elder tells him he can stay for the night, but must leave in the morning. The man, called Seeker, tells stories of the Jedi and the Force, and about asteroids belts that house giant slugs, and cantinas, and jungles, and city-worlds. The children are sent to bed and Seeker and the elder discuss the Tide and the Force. They debate and Seeker quotes Yoda again. Seeker passes trials to prove himself worthy of knowledge about the Tide. He continues to indicate that he is Luke by talking about things like X-Wings and Beggar’s Canyon. Seeker barely fails the third trial, but learns as much about the Tide as he would have learned if he had succeeded. He says his farewells, gets into his X-Wing with a blue-and-silver dome chirping on top, and flies away to seek out other aspects of the Force he can learn from. 

The ship’s custodian droid then tells a story that has been passed from droid to droid around the galaxy without change. On Cro-Akon, a construction droid is stolen by slavers. The droid, Zeta, awakens on a ship filled with other captured droids, bound for the Unknown Regions. They dock on a space station called the Gem, where the captain tries to sell them to the station. One white, silver, and blue astromech manages to slice through one of its restraining bolts and catches the interest of the buyers. The world below the station, just called the Deep, has valuable materials in its interior, but the surface is inhospitable. In order to maintain their lifestyle, the nobles of the Gem put droids to work on the Deep. Because of acid and heat, even construction droids don’t last more than a few months. Zeta is put to work as an enforcer to make the other droids work, with an override chip forcing her to do her job. R2-D2 tries to cheer up the other droids as they are brought down to the surface. They are put to work and Artoo refuses to give up hope that his master will rescue him. One day, a strange, bulky protocol droid is delivered and put to work. The droid turns out to be Luke in disguise, there to rescue Artoo. Luke and Artoo get the override chip out of Zeta and lead the droids in a revolt. The nobles are overthrown, all of the droids are returned to their homes, and Luke and Artoo leave.

The fifth story is told from the point of view of Lugubrious Mote, a mole-flea who lived on Salacious Crumb. We read the flea’s exaggerated telling of Return of the Jedi, starting with Luke’s hologram to Jabba. The flea speaks with Leia the night before Luke shows up, and jumps into the rancor pit to help Luke and prove to Leia that she can be an ally. In the flea’s telling, Luke is much more useless and relies on Mote’s help to defeat the rancor and escape the sarlacc. After the escape, Leia transfers the flea to a woolly hopwell beast and the flea travels around the galaxy before joining a circus.

The final story is told from the point of view of a scientist, then a biology student trying to do fieldwork in the Agoliba-Tu system. She catches a ride to the system in an A-wing piloted by Luke. Luke asks her if she had ever seen any ancient Jedi ruins, as he is trying to learn as much as he can about them. The two of them accidentally wander into an exogorth, the same species as the one the Millennium Falcon had been stuck in years prior. They wander deeper into the slug, encountering a variety of unique creatures that live inside of the beast. They get out with the sacrifice of ancient beings known as Mist-Weavers who had been stuck in the beast themselves for an eon. Luke and the scientist part ways.",StarWarsLeaks,169,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/75jwsp/the_legends_of_luke_skywalker_summary/,Leak!,marvelstarwars,75jwsp,/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/75jwsp/the_legends_of_luke_skywalker_summary/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/75jwsp/the_legends_of_luke_skywalker_summary/,62,2017-10-10

"[Spoilers] A tidbit from ""A Certain Point of View"" that added to a season 3 episode","First up, if you haven't read ""From a Certain Point of View,"" I highly recommend it. I've been digging the stories about the Jawas and Tusken Raiders. Tatooine is a lively place. 

Anyway, there's a part in one of Obi-Wan's stories  I noticed yesterday (Time of Death) that goes through a bunch of flashbacks of his life. One of them is him giving Maul a funeral pyre after killing him in Twin Suns.

I know I've been down on that episode and Obi-Wan's involvement in the past, but this really hit me in the feels and changed my perspective of that scene.

So, not only is Obi-Wan reluctant to fight Maul and ignites his lightsaber at the last minute when there's no other way out. Not only does he hold him as he dies and feels sad about it. But, he also gives him a proper funeral pyre??

That's some A+ character development. He's incredibly sympathetic and compassionate. Aside from Luke, I don't think I've seen a main Jedi character show such kindness toward a major villain like that.

One thing I hope to see in the last two movies of the sequel trilogy,"Despite the technological advances SINCE the prequels, I want the lightsaber duels to look and feel different, and here's why.

At the end of Return of the Jedi, all force-users who were trained in **classical** [lightsaber combat](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat/Legends) (Forms I-VII) were either dead (Yoda, Darth Vader, Palpatine, and Obi-Wan Kenobi and many others) or were in exile and irrelevant. 

Yes, Luke was instructed by both Kenobi and Yoda, but mostly in the force. Luke's lightsaber skills are still very much unrefined from the perspective of a classical lightsaber duelist after RotJ.

Luke did go on to find holocrons that detailed the forms of classical lightsaber combat - Shii-Cho, Makashi, Soresu, Shien/Djem So, Niman, Juyo - but he was not instructed in them. Instead, he pulled elements from all 7 forms to create the three new styles of lightsaber combat for the New Jedi Order (Fast, Medium, Strong). 

Basically classical lightsaber combat lives on through the new three styles, but since each style borrows from different forms, they look and are utilized distinctly differently from the Jedi and Sith of the prequel era and before. 

I want the lightsaber duels to be awesome and fast like the prequels, but I also want the new duels to show the progression of lightsaber combat, starting with its death in RotJ when Yoda, Vader, and Palpatine die, and its revival when Luke creates the three new styles. I want the choreography to look different because of this.

Thanks for reading. :)

EDIT: Yes, I know that Kylo and Rey's duel looked different, but that was because they both suck at lightsaber combat, not because they were both heavily trained in the new styles. Kylo was, but he evidently was not that good.",StarWars,42,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/75igyf/one_thing_i_hope_to_see_in_the_last_two_movies_of/,General Discussion,EnderVex,75igyf,/r/StarWars/comments/75igyf/one_thing_i_hope_to_see_in_the_last_two_movies_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/75igyf/one_thing_i_hope_to_see_in_the_last_two_movies_of/,9,2017-10-10

"Because it might interest some of you: for the french release of The Last Jedi, the ambiguity has been lifted as it was translated as A PLURAL","the french title is ""les derniers jedis"" (""the last jedis"") so any ambiguity on the subject is gone. And i know some people might think the distributors are wrong, but the producers (especially Disney) would make extra sure not to have such a high profile movie release under a stupid title.

But then again, die hard 2 was released as 58 minutes to live, and i can't even remember if this has any connection to the plot. Still less stupid than Die Harderder, though.

Sohere you: have i reached 300 words, yet? I sure hope so.

Maybe i should use a word counter. What are those, though?

Apart from counting words and characters, our online editor can help you to improve word choice and writing style, and, optionally, help you to detect grammar mistakes and plagiarism. To check word count, simply place your cursor into the text box above and start typing. You'll see the number of characters and words increase or decrease as you type, delete, and edit them. You can also copy and paste text from another program over into the online editor above. The Auto-Save feature will make sure you won't lose any changes while editing, even if you leave the site and come back later. Tip: Bookmark this page now.

Knowing the word count of a text can be important. For example, if an author has to write a minimum or maximum amount of words for an article, essay, report, story, book, paper, you name it. WordCounter will help to make sure its word count reaches a specific requirement or stays within a certain limit.

In addition, WordCounter shows you the top 10 keywords and keyword density of the article you're writing. This allows you to know which keywords you use how often and at what percentages. This can prevent you from over-using certain words or word combinations and check for best distribution of keywords in your writing.

In the Details overview you can see the average speaking and reading time for your text, while Reading Level is an indicator of the education level a person would need in order to understand the ",movies,16,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/75j62m/because_it_might_interest_some_of_you_for_the/,,largerpenis,75j62m,/r/movies/comments/75j62m/because_it_might_interest_some_of_you_for_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/75j62m/because_it_might_interest_some_of_you_for_the/,91,2017-10-10

[SPOILERS] My Theory After the New Trailer,"I marked this as spoiler, but really this is all speculation. Only possible spoilers are the discussion of certain trailer clips. Anyway... based on Luke saying he experienced this power only once before, and Snoke saying he saw raw power, and beyond that, something truly special, I have a feeling the flashback to the Jedi temple will go something like this: 

Snoke, bearing no scars, will show up at the Jedi temple to kill Luke/his padawans. In the process a young Rey will have a Gohan/Harry Potter-esque explosion of emotion and power that wipes everything out, injuring Snoke. This also causes her to lose her memory of these events. One of those left standing will be Ben Solo. Seeing this, Snoke will abduct Ben thinking he caused the explosion, then raise him believing he was the one with the explosion of power that killed so many. This lead Ben down the dark side, becoming Kylo Ren, because he believes he killed so he must be evil. Luke, out of the shame of not being able to save his padawans and not being able to contain Rey, hides her from Snoke and goes into hiding himself. In The Last Jedi, he is actually resuming his training of Rey. Kylo will realize he didn't do what he was originally told.

"[Star Wars] A Prophecy Misread, Could Have Been. Luke, Kylo, and Snoke","I was reading a few of the other star wars theories and it got me thinking. The force being in balance never had anything to do with the number of dark and light side wielders.

The force was naturally in balance throughout all living things. Then some super force sensitive creatures come about and start manipulating the force. From that perspective, ~~the jedi are evil!~~ the dark side users aren't the only ones throwing the balance through a loop. ANYTHING that is manipulating the force strongly is unbalancing it within life forms. I think Luke realized this, and that's what he meant by the Jedi must be destroyed. After reflecting on the previous century's events, he concluded that force users inherently unbalance the force by manipulating it, no matter how they do so.

Things get crazier when you put Luke's realization into context with the destruction of the new Jedi temple. What if Luke concluded that force users were the problem after having restarted his school. Perhaps he tried to dismantle it there. Perhaps someone, maybe even a nephew, didn't take kindly to having his dreams of becoming a powerful force user taken away from him after being promised he would live up to his grandfather.

If that's all the case, then Luke is the first chain in the events that lead to the destruction of the new Jedi. Luke's refusal to train new force users created a power vacuum. And Snoke, watching it all from a distance, saw an opportunity to act.

That leads into the second part. I think Snoke is a former apprentice of a dark side user who, in accordance with the rule of two, attempted to assassinate his master. But he failed. Snoke features some pretty nasty battle wounds and losing a fight with a Sith lord would explain why. Snoke spent the last 50+ years licking his wounds after attempting to surpass Palpatine, Plagueis, or perhaps someone else to the Sith throne. This also explains why he only uses a projection to talk with his disciple! He knows first hand that sith apprentices will inevitably try to usurp their master. Snoke isn't taking any chances and keeps quite a few light years in between him and his new apprentice.",FanTheories,273,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/75mjiw/star_wars_a_prophecy_misread_could_have_been_luke/,FanSpeculation,NostraDamnUs,75mjiw,/r/FanTheories/comments/75mjiw/star_wars_a_prophecy_misread_could_have_been_luke/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/75mjiw/star_wars_a_prophecy_misread_could_have_been_luke/,59,2017-10-11

"So we see Snoke's face in the new ""The Last Jedi"" trailer....","I don't know what most of y'all are feeling, but I'm still hoping beyond hope that Snoke is our lord and savior Jar Jar, back to show us his true and magnificent self. Most of my reasoning was because of the hologram that Snoke was using, and that maybe he was taking on a different form in the hologram. But in the new trailer, we see Snoke's face with no hologram, meaning he actually looks like he does in the hologram and not like the beautiful gungan we all know and adore.

Still Feelin' Plagueis Theory Especially After the Trailer...,"I've posted on here on a number of different accounts. I was the guy who brought the mathematical analysis of Pablo's tweets using Baye's rule for probability of Snoke being Plagueis given Pablo's tweet and probability of Pablo's tweet given Snoke is Plagueis, and plotting it in MATLAB. And the musical analysis of Snoke's music using soundcloud:

https://soundcloud.com/user-55089240/plagueiss-theme-snokes-theme

So, those were my contributions earlier. The next thing that is just stoking my instincts is as follows. Whether or not he's Plagueis, there are two very interesting things to note in the trailer:

Kylo Ren looks a LOT like Anakin Skywalker post-Vader in the first shot, just as he says ""when I found you.""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJ36oNzD2zo

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b2/55/bb/b255bb06f0993f159ea96cca165a8bbb.jpg

This feels like forshadowing to me, like Snoke's relationship with the Skywalkers is actually pretty deep. It almost seems as if they're saying that Snoke found *Anakin...*

The more important thing is one of the key features of Plagueis: the ability to cheat death. Snoke looks like a zombie in The Force Awakens. In The Last Jedi, he's *noticeably improved.*

http://media.comicbook.com/2017/10/star-wars-the-last-jedi-supreme-leader-snoke-new-trailer-1036479-320x180.jpg

This is kind of bridging the gap on one of the key points of criticism towards Plagueis theory: its a little ridiculous to resurrect/reincarnate someone, or bring them back from the brink of death. But, now it looks like Snoke can restore life force to himself. And, Plagueis is the only other known canon character with that ability.

He has the murdered by Palpatine look. Nothing's really out of place with the theory.

And lets face it... If Snoke isn't someone big we're going to be disappointed: they made his backstory so cryptic. It's like ""we're going to be so cryptic and mysterious about this guy's backstory, and shroud him in mystery, piquing everyone's curiosity"" aaaaaaand he's just some new rando we made up.

Not buying it. His identity is important. It'll suck if it doesn't have a significance that is meaningful to the whole audience - and the master of the master of Vader is literally the only meaningful answer that doesn't feel like shit.",starwarsspeculation,16,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75sh84/still_feelin_plagueis_theory_especially_after_the/,THEORY,Xallios,75sh84,/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75sh84/still_feelin_plagueis_theory_especially_after_the/,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75sh84/still_feelin_plagueis_theory_especially_after_the/,36,2017-10-11

The point of it all.,"It occurred to me during my 100th(?) attempt at the Thrawn event: I keep asking myself what's the point in gearing characters for legendary events if you won't use them ever again - nor will you use said legendary if you have a better team that doesn't include them. This is especially true with Yoda, which many players will never level/gear up after unlockment - but still remains true for Phoenix if you don't like them as characters and as a team. Then I understood this problem is not limited to these unfortunate characters, but extended on the whole game. After finally unlocking the CLS of the moment or finally placing in tiers 1-50 of arena, you'll have no reason to power up anything if you don't believe you'll be easily pushed back to the last tiers. This has been clear after seeing Fleet arena was almost frozen. 

So I think there are two possible solutions for this.

1- an Achievements rework, that updates that section to a trophy room. When you get trophies, you get the usual rewards and a trophy in your Trophy Room, which will grow from empty to full as you progress in the game. This way we might get secret or special trophies too, like in ither games. I don't know. ""don't tell me the odds"": Win a battle using only Han Solo. These will not grant rewards, but will look worthy because they won't just disappear upon completion. On the contrary, they will appear.

2- This would be more of a long term change.

Inspired by Hero's Journey, we might get permanent 'events' for every character: like a Yoda campaign on Kashyyyk. required: yoda. Also accepted for the team: Wookiees, Jedi. You will NOT get any reward for completing it, but you'll be able to play it every day., and being fun, it will make every character worthy.

(You know The wrong Jedi, right? CUP (required) and clones campaign: Capture Ahsoka Tano)

Then after completing these campaigns once, you'll be able to make them more difficult. And then more and more until you fail.

Thoughts: I don't know if you like the idea. I do. I'll love something like a story mode. And I also think this will be a win for CG as well: Whales will compete with each other to set a record on beaten difficulty level. And while whales try to defeat a level 142 Maul in the QGJ campaign, F2P will have fun playing this without a limit, and the online time will exponentially increase (like the income from whales buying CUP shards)

What if Kylo Ren decided to take down Snoke on his own?,"transgressions, but I think his redemption ark is possible still.


The last trailer had me thinking that The Raw power that Luke was talking about was in fact Kylo. Since even before he was born Ben was inbetween the light and the dark side. In the canon book Star Wars: Aftermath-Life Debt, Leia already could sense this. 
*""...Her thoughts reach for her wayward brother like a living thing, like branches seeking he sun. I need you here. I need your help. Luke sometimes had a farm boy's naïveté, yes, but right now she feels she could use a little of that. Her mind is a tangle of thoughts. The complexities of politics, the love of (and anger over) Han, the loss of Luke, and above all else the ever persistent worry about the life she carries--- Her skin tingles. Her mind feels suddenly unmoved from the rest of her. Leia feels dizzy enough to fall over. Oh. Oh, my! There! There it is. Washing over her and through her---and awareness unlike any she's ever felt before. A pulsing glow, flickering and strong. It's not the plant. It's not Luke. It's not even Han. It's her child. This isn't just a mother's recognition of the life inside---that she already knows....This is something separate from her. It isn't a physical feeling*. *It is all around her.....As such, she is suddenly aware of her child's mind and spirit: She senses pluck and wit and steel blood and a keen mind and by the blood of Alderaan is this one going to be a fighter! Wait. He? It's a boy. It's a boy. Her hands fly in front of her mouth as she both laughs and cries at the same time. This, she thinks, is the light side that Luke always goes on about---the promise of light, the promise of a new life...and then, the black edging of the dark side encircles her bliss like a noose. Because what rides swift on the heels of hope but fear--a fear that stretches out far and wide like a growing shadow.....""*
 
Since He was young Leia and Han were aware of how much Vader was in Ben and his conflict with the dark side of the force, But busy as they were with their own personal missions they mostly left Ben to fend for himself. But something made them finally send Ben to his uncle Luke.
 I believe this might have been a raw demostration of his force abilities. Also, Leia already knew by this time that Snoke was targeting Ben.

During his time training with Luke, Ben doesn't made much progress because Luke training, solely based on jedi principles it's not the right tool to balance the light and dark inside of Ben.
What if Ben recognized the danger that Snoke possessed and tried to fight it, but he didn't have the strenght to do so, and Luke underestimated the situation?
*“If you really imagine the stakes of him, in his youth, having all these special powers and having your parents kind of be absent during that process on their own agendas, equally as selfish. He’s lost in the world that he was raised in, and feels that he was kind of abandoned by the people that he’s closest with. He’s angry because of that, I think, and he has a huge grudge on his shoulders.”* (Adam Driver about his Character)

The breaking point in Ben's life comes after Leia's lineage is revealed Throughout Bloodlines Leia expresses concern over Ben’s fledgling capacity to potentially do bad things with his power as one of the reasons she and Han have kept his grandfather’s legacy from him, except now the secret is out to the galaxy.
Leia leaves a holomessage for Ben that finally reveals the truth, but it’s not known if he receives it—either way, this betrayal of trust is likely to be one of the driving factors that pushes Ben to the edge.


What if the destruction of Luke's Academy was not really planned by Ben, but a consequence of a rage outburst of raw force after He found out about his connection to Vader, something which was hidden from him during his whole life and that could have easily explained his affinity to the dark side of the force. 

In the new trailer we see Luke's cybernetic arm coming out of rubble, I think that's not a scene from the Academy destruction, but from the hut destruction in Ach-to. Maybe Rey or Kylo...or even Luke destroyed the hut in a similar manner as Ben destroyed the Academy, or as Rey shattered that rock while meditating as we see in the second trailer.
 This would explain the whole change in character in Luke. As a light force user, trained as a jedi he didn't understand the true balance in the force, he underestimated the influence and importance of the dark side, and by doing so he failed his own nephew as a teacher. This sense of failure it's what drives him to lead an hermit's life away from the friends and family he feels he dissapointed.

After the destruction of the Jedi Academy, Ben realises there's no way back. He's made something unforgivable, but he can still redeem part  of his guilt by correcting some evils. He understood from the beginning the danger in Snoke, but he also knows nobody is going to help him, he has to do this by himself. He also understands that to find true balance, and to destroy Snoke he had to know the dark side of the force first. I think is possible Anakin Ghost presented himself to Ben at this time and showed him the path he had to follow. In TFA, Kylo says ""Show me **again** grandfather, and I will finnish what you started"". I think by he refers to Vader killing Palpatine.

So, Ben goes to Snoke and becomes his apprentice, in order to learn from him, but Snoke is aware of the ever present light in Kylo in the form of compassion, for his family, for the scavanger girl. We know that by TFA, Kylo it's still in training and he doesn't yet know true dark side techniques as a strong force choke or force lightning...he doesn't even know how to build a proper light saber.


**KYLO AND REY**

The connection between Kylo and Rey it's stated since before their first interaction (In Rey's force vision) and after they met in Takodana, Kylo shows interest in her instantly. By the time in the interrogation scene Kylo already felt the presence of the force in Rey and the same conflict he himself experiences between light and dark. That's what he means by ""Don't be afraid, I feel it too"". When Rey pulls back into his mind he's not shocked because she was able to do so, but because he read too much into his truth ""You are afraid you will never be as strong as Darth Vader "" (you are afraid you will never be able to defeat your own master)
He needs to prove himself in front of Snoke, in order to learn what he needs to know to be able to defeat him.
If you follow this line of thought, then these quotes had suddenly a new meaning: 
*""I will fulfill our Destiny"" 
*""Nothing will stand in our way. I will finish what you started"".
*""I'll show them the power of the darkness""
 *""Forgive me. I feel it again... the call from light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again the power of the darkness, and I'll let nothing stand in our way. Show me, grandfather, and I will finish what you started.""


To prove himself he has to do a great sacrifice, kill his own father. *""I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. I know what I must do. I don't know if I'm strong enough to do it. Will you help me?""* he said, talking to his father, Han Solo just before he stabs him through the chest.

But it doesn't go as planned. As it's stated in the script of TFA. Kylo is **weakened** by this act. He realised this in the same moment. 
But all is not lost, he has another option: The Girl. With her help he can defeat Snoke, but she's untrained. That's why he offers to be her teacher and show her the ways of the force. But she despises him and it's not eager to join him.

i think in The Last Jedi we will see Kylo trying to follow his original plan and to prove his allegiance to Snoke in order to get the ultimate knowledge to end his master, but after The Supreme Leader requests from him to kill Leia, and he's unable to do so, he will have to admit to himself he's not able to do this on his own. He need the help of every other force user in the galaxy, so he will go after Luke and Rey in Ach-to to try to recruit them to his cause.",starwarsspeculation,7,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75rs23/what_if_kylo_ren_decided_to_take_down_snoke_on/,THEORY,orevalc,75rs23,/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75rs23/what_if_kylo_ren_decided_to_take_down_snoke_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75rs23/what_if_kylo_ren_decided_to_take_down_snoke_on/,2,2017-10-11

[Theory] My theory about Rey's past and her future in The Last Jedi,"Hey everyone! After watching the official trailer for **The Last Jedi**, I've been discussing with my brother and friends a lot about the new information we see. After also putting on our tinfoil hats and discussing multiple theories, I thought of one relating to Rey's past and her future in **The Last Jedi**. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

**Rey's Past**

* Rey is born with a CRAZY amount of power in the Force. Might be the force manifestation itself again like Anakin was.
* Rey is taken into the Jedi temple when she is young and during her training, Luke realizes what immense power she has. At the same time, Snoke discovers Rey's power too and wants to utilize her for his will. Maybe at the start of The Last Jedi trailer during Snoke's monologue, he was actually talking to Rey, not Kylo.

&gt;When I found you I saw raw untamed power, and beyond that, something truly special

* Meanwhile, Kylo is still seduced to the dark side by Snoke. However, when it comes to the Jedi Temple ""incident"", Kylo's role is actually a little bit different: Kylo and the Knights of Ren went to go retrieve Rey from The Jedi Temple. During the process, Rey's power is triggered and **she becomes uncontrollable** out of anger/self-defense, destroying the new Jedi Order and the Jedi Temple in the process. Maybe her flashback in TFA, when she is in the rain in the middle of a field with bodies lying all around, was caused by her?

* Luke, in an attempt to save himself and to prevent Snoke from taking over/controlling Rey, **locks** Rey's power within her with his own force powers (since Rey is still a little girl then, her power is still at an infantile stage and manageable by Luke). Luke also wipes her mind to not remember the incident and then places her in Jakku. Kinda like burying a nuke in the middle of the desert hoping no one finds it.

**The Present/Future**

* During the events of TFA, Rey is now older and her powers (which are still 'locked' and unknown to her) have grown too. In the TFA, her powers start to reach a point where it is able to overcome Luke's ability to keep it contained (mind wipe is still working though... for now). This explains the Mary Sue fallacy in the TFA how Rey learned all of her abilities **SUPER FAST**. Her powers are starting to leak out very quickly. 

&gt; Something inside me has always been there, but now it’s awake and I need help.

* (Note: Not sure if Luke knows Rey's identity at this point but let's assume he doesn't) Now, after finding Luke at the end of TFA, he starts to train Rey in the ways of the force. During the process, however, after seeing the magnitude of Rey's power, he realizes who she is and refuses to train her. Probably because of the trauma Luke faced from her power and the PTSD it caused, it prevents him from training her to use it for good.

&gt; I’ve seen this raw strength only once before. It didn’t scare me enough then **(Jedi Temple Incident??)**. It does now.

* Rey is frustrated from Luke refusing to train her and she still wants to find out her potential and find out truly who she is and what she is meant to be. Now that one powerful Force figure refuses to train her, another powerful force user is offering the answers she seeks... Snoke.

26 F4A Dark side Rey gets some kinky powers,"Hey everyone, first of all how awesome was that last Jedi trailer?

I came up with an idea when I play Rey as she turns to the dark side becoming a slutty, kinky and horrible dark side mistress.

I want to abuse, torture and generally play with some people who can only be described as victims.

I also want kinky powers to alter people's bodies especially my own including futa, expansion, weight gain and perhaps some kinky Dark side induced hyper pregnancy.

SNOKE IS TENEBRAE/VITIATE/ VALKORION (THEORY),"This one, like many other posts in Reddit, is about Snoke. My theory is simple: I think Supreme Leader Snoke is Tenebrae/Vitiate/Valkorion. Now, the arguments in which I support this idea are many and would give the Star Wars Universe a huge twist in terms of coherence and cohesion between all its eras, from the Old Republic to the New Order.

First, we must acknowledge Tenebrae/Vitiate/Valkorion story. According to wookipedia, Tenebrae was a human bastard born at 5113 BBY from a peasant woman and Lord Dramath, ruler of the planet Medriaas. At age 10 he murdered his father and 3 years later was named Lord Vitiate by the Sith Lord Marka Ragnos, leader of the Sith Council.

He ruled the world of Medriaas for over a century, changing its name to Nathema. When Ragnos died at 5000 BBY, he decided to step back from the fight for the throne between the Sith Lords Naga Sadow and Ludo Kreessh and stayed in his world, safe from harm. Also, he refrains to participate in the fight between the Sith and the Galactic Republic, embarked by Sadow, known as the Great Hyperspace War.

 During all his reign on Nathema, Vitiate studied the Dark Side in search for power and he came back with a ritual powerful enough to make him inmortal. Since the plan required a heavy presence of the Dark Side and the Force Power of many living beings, he planned to take advantage of the Sith’s fear of defeat at the hands of the Republic, so he called all their remaining to his world to unify their forces against their common enemy, that was a lie. When they arrived, he put his ritual in motion and so he stole the Force Power of all Nathema’s living beings, transforming the whole planet in a void in the Force. With that he became immortal.

Later, he took all the spare Sith forces in the Galaxy that didn’t attended to his call and regroup them to create the Sith Empire. He blamed the Jedi for the destruction of Nathema and begun an exodus to the Unknown Regions of the Galaxy (and we know Snoke were hidden in that part of the Galaxy during the Clone Wars and the Empire) to finally base his new Sith Empire on Drommun Kaas. There he was known just as The Sith Emperor, and so he ruled for over 1000 years in secret. In parallel to the last centuries of this millennia, and thus is not precisely know when, he begins the construction of the Eternal Empire based on Zakuul, using the mighty technology of the long death Empire of Iokath, now ruled by droids, to bring prosperity to it. Later I will talk about this, for now let’s focus on the Sith Empire.

During all this time, Vitiate studied the Force even deeper, to the point he came out with a ritual the he thought was powerful enough to steal all the Force Energy of the Galaxy for himself, but to do so, he required the Galaxy to be surrounded by the Dark Side. To do so, he started to create conflict between the different factions of the Galaxy. First, with help of a Pureblood Sith emissary, Vitiate convinced Mandalore the Ultimate to rage a war against the Republic. This war, known as the Mandalorian Wars, started on 3976 BBY and lasted for 16 years.

In this conflict, the Mandalorians almost won, ultil the young Jedi Knight Revan took control over the Republic forces alongside his friend Malak. After Revan defeated Mandalore the Ultimate on Malachore V and the great weapon of the Emperor, the Mass Shadow Generator was activated, killing all around the planet, Revan and Malak begun a search for this mysterious Emperor. Finally, they meet him in Drommun Kaas a couple of years later and both were subdued and mentally controlled by Vitiate, who transform them in Sith. After this, he sends both Sith to search for the Star Forge, a super space station capable of creating “an infinite droid army” (according to the dialogues in the Star Forge Flashpoint on SWTOR, there were 3 super space stations: one to build and infinite army, another to build an undefeatable space fleet and a third one of unknown capabilities. This three space stations are products of the long death empire of the Rakata), to grow the scale of the Sith Empire’s army to start a war against the Republic, but in an unpredicted twist of events, Revan and Malak broke free. They took the Star Forge and they constructed a new Sith Empire with the mission to conquer the Republic and the Galaxy to protect it against Vitiate’s plan of utter destruction, so the Jedi Civil War started.

What they didn’t knew was that each war anyone rage was in direct benefit of Vitiate’s plan, because in war only the Dark Side grow stronger and spread across the Galaxy. So, in their attempt to fight against the Emperor, they were helping him.

Eventually, Malak betrayed Revan during a Jedi fleet attack. The first one became the ruler of this new Sith Empire, and the second one was captured by the Jedi, who wipe out his memory to reconvert him intro a Jedi. They manage to do it but his memories on Drommun Kaas quickly reappeared in his mind. With the company of his droid he retraced his journey to Nathema in search for the Sith Empire but is captured by Darth Nyriss and Darth Scourge “The Wrath of The Emperor”. Later, around 3950 BBY, his friend The Jedi Exiled, traced back the steps of Revan and found Drommun Kaas. There he infiltrated the Empire to find him. He was held prisoner for four years until he managed to convince Darth Scourge to help him defeat Vitiate and put an end to his maleficent plan. They plot against Nyriss, to let Revan free to fight the Emperor. Scourge told him that Nyriss was a conspirator against him and Vitiate started a purge against all the Sith Council. In the turmoil, Revan, his droid, The Jedi Exiled and Darth Scourge confronted the Emperor. He fought them back and tried to dominate Revan’s mind once again, but he resisted and opened himself to both the Dark Side and the Light, becoming a Force Wilder powerful enough to fight in equal terms against Vitiate. This alliance was short and Scourge betrayed both Jedi. Revan was re imprisoned in the Malestorm Nebula and Scourge regain his position as “The Wrath”. 

The Emperor fed on Revan’s Force Power and knowledge for over 200 years while advancing in his plans to invade the rest of the Galaxy. But the assassination attempt against him motivated Vitiate to study further in the Dark Side a way to be safe against future threats. Eventually he came up with a new power: The Force Essence Transfer, or the capability to pass his consciousness from body to body. This new power prevented him to die out alongside the death of his current body, and furthermore, to gain control over someone else body to continue to live. During this time, he realised his Sith Empire was doomed because of the rigid beliefs of the Sith, their constants internal fights for power and the flaws of the Dark Side. He divided his consciousness in several bodies and with one he went on a search for another civilization to rule and rise as a mighty empire capable of gain control over the entire Galaxy and in his endeavour, he found Zakuul and later a seemingly infinite fleet of sentient droids. He developed and unified the nomad communities of the planet onto a sophisticated society. Decades later, with the help of a Force Vision’s obsessed cult that he created, called the Scions of Zakuul, he found the fleet of which he gained control over with the technology of the Eternal Throne, capable of command the GEMINI units that command every starship of the fleet, and he created the Eternal Empire, with him at the head, as the Immortal Emperor Valkorion, and the Eternal Fleet as his hammer force.

The other bodies or “Voices of the Emperor” stayed at Drommun Kaas to oversaw the preparations and execution of the war against the Republic, that started at 3681 BBY, when he announced the return of the Sith Empire to de Galaxy. His strategies were flawless in the Outer Rim and his forces managed to press the Republic to the Core Worlds. But all this war effort where never meant to achieve a real dominance of the Sith in the Galaxy. The propose of this whole war was to grant Vitiate power and to spread the Dark Side all over the Galaxy, to prepare it for the ultimate ritual that would take out the Force Energy of the entire Galaxy for him.

Around 3663 BBY, Valkorion had an affair with Senia Tyrell. She had twin siblings: Arcann and Thexan. And some time later a young daughter called Vaylin. During this time, the war against the Republic was complicated to the Sith and Vitiate became absent from his family in Zakuul to focus all his attention in to maintain the ground and mighty of the Sith Empire. Time before Vaylin was born, the influence of Revan in the Emperor’s mind took part and peace negotiations begun between the Sith and the Republic. The Coruscant Treaty was signed at 3653 BBY. After this, all the Emperor’s attention went to the Eternal Empire and he let the Sith at the hands of the Sith Council. He took a special interest in his prodigy daughter who had heritage his father’s power in the Force. To control her at his will (and to make her a perfect vessel for his immortal consciousness) and to tame her power, he sent Vaylin to Nathema, to be conditioned to Valkorion’s mind control.

During the time of the Galactic Cold War that followed the Treaty, the conflict did not stop. With the help of a strike team, the Republic managed to free Revan from his prison on the Nebula and out of the Emperor’s mind influence. Later, he returned to the Star Forge and allied himself with the Republic once again. The Emperor, in the other hand, was almost ready to change the course of the Galaxy once again: The Cold War was just a big breath before the last steps of his great plan was fully executed. But something else gain his attention: He knew his current body wasn’t powerful enough to do the ritual and although he had been preparing his daughter as his new vessel, she was so reckless and untameable that the only way he managed to control her was with a strong psychological conditioning, but he knew that wasn’t guarantee enough that he could gain final control of her body in the Force Essence Transfer ritual. But a new hero that took relevance during this time was not only powerful but also had control of his/her power and a big reputation all around the Galaxy (the hero of the SWTOR game). The Emperor then put in motion a plan to test and drive him/her as close as possible to himself. This plan was later interrupted by Darth Malgus and his brief attempt to make an Empire of his own using the new stealth fleet, since he realized the Sith Emperor was neglecting and absent, and thus, the Empire was at the verge of collapse on itself, because of the vacuum of power and the ineffective government of the Sith Council. These rebellious actions lasted shortly thanks to the quick and effective response of the Empire forces. Alongside this time, Vitiate was confronted in the Dark Temple by a strike force during the Invasion of Drommun Kaas and the Voice that guarded his will there was destroyed, but his essence remained. Although the objective of the invasion was “successful” it wasn’t, the Empire retook the planet and the Sith Council took full control over it.

Shortly after that, Revan begun his own movement recruiting all his revanite followers across the Galaxy to build an army called The Order of Revan, to finally destroy Vitiate by rematerialize his body and kill in a way he dies completely. Both the Empire and the Republic considered Revan a threat because of his dreadful plan of bringing Vitiate alive again (what they didn’t knew was that he was fully alive as Valkorion in Zakuul and that all these huge galactic events where just a game for him and a way to get closer to this hero of the Cold War), so they formed a Coalition to fight him in Yavin IV, where he based his forces around the ancient Temple of Sacrifice that contained a mechanism to withdraw energy form living beings, but also, as Revan discovered, a way to bring back Vitiate, to finally kill him once and for all. The elite forces of the Coalition (in which the hero was the leader) confronted Revan in the Temple and defeat him, but the ritual to bring Vitiate back was partially successful. His Force Essence flee Yavin IV and travelled to Ziost, where he possessed every living thing, as he so many centurys ago did with Nathema, and as it did to that desolated planet, he took by himself all life in Ziost.

Later, the forces of the Coalition regroup to pursue Vitiate essence to its source intro the Unknown Regions of the Galaxy, after a mysterious army assaulted Korriban and Thyton. There the Empire and the Republic discovered the Eternal Empire of Zakuul and Darth Marr identified the essence of Vitiate in the ruler of this civilization: Valkorion. In this first encounter with the new physical form of the Emperor, the hero, with the help of prince Arcann, strikes down Valkorion, whom had planned this all along, and transferred his Force Essence intro this outlander’s body, but since the process was rushed by the mortal wound Valkorion suffered, he took place inside the outlander’s mind as a guest, not as the one in control of it and its body. The outlander was condemned by the crime and was frozen in carbonite.

Five years later he was brought back by Lana Beniko and Theron Shan. On that time, the Eternal Empire was in control of almost all the Galaxy, but without the direction of Valkorion, the Empire was stagnant in a defensive position after the Eternal Fleet won against both the Sith Empire and the Republic.

Valkorion, inside the outlander, deceive him to the point on trusting him to release his might against his new enemies: The Eternal Empire. With help of his friends alongside the Galaxy, the outlander made an Alliance against the tyranny of Zakuul. Many free joined it, including the Sith Empire and the Republic. The fight, at first, was to defeat Arcann, take the Eternal Throne and make the Eternal Empire retreat to Zakuul once again, but Valkorion’s plan was to make of the outlander a symbol of hope and trust all around the Galaxy: a symbol of the light. While, in the other hand, make of the Eternal Empire the tool of the Dark Side, to spread chaos and fear, and he knew there were no better rulers for his plan to be the way he wanted to be than his siblings: the son that killed his own father, brother and almost his mother for power, and the daughter with an incomparable power in the Force, so huge that is almost untameable without the right direction (pretty much like Kylo/Ben and Rey, since him is pushed by Snoke to kill his own father and mother to let go of the light forever, and Rey, who is the awakening of the Force), but since he never found a way to do so, he found a new use for her, as the most powerful avatar of the Dark Side he could find. So, both at the head of Zakuul were the heralds of the Dark Side in the Galaxy at this point.

Against Valkorion’s expectations, Arcann was brought back to the light by Senya, his mother (Valkorion learned about this mistake and that’s why he commanded Kylo Ren to kill both Han and Leia), but since Valkorion’s plan was wise, Vaylin was a perfect replacement. After all, she was more of a tyrant than his brother and she would be in power only long enough to increase to the top the Dark Side around the Galaxy while the outlander would be the ultimate avatar of the light, guarding all hopes and dreams of freedom of everyone in the Galaxy. The fight between these completely opposite forces would leave the Force in a perfect balance, and in that balance, that Vitiate learned long ago from Revan, he would find a power big enough for him to complete his ritual and drain all Force Life Power from the entire Galaxy, so he may become a god without bounds.

His plan was almost perfect, but he did never truly realise the willpower of the outlander, so after the final battle between him and Vaylin, were the outlander won, in the moment were Valkorion betrayed him/her and tried to dominate him/her, he lost and was cast out of the outlander’s body forever. 

This point is supposed to mark the final death of Tenebrae/Vitiate/Valkorion, but in SWTOR we never saw the proper Force Essence destruction ritual that Revan (the one who knew Vitiate the most, in all his plans and flaws) tried to perform in Yavin IV, so it’s more than possible that the Force Essence of Valkorion may had used his remaining strengths to hide himself in the Unknown Regions of the Galaxy once again, to rebuild himself and await until the state of the Galaxy where once again as dark as it was during this times.
We must not forget that, although there were wars and conflicts before these events, none of them were as wild and dreadful as the war between Zakuul and the Alliance, until the Clone Wars. Along with that, Bane’s rule of two took place near 1000 BBY, and the Sith path took a completely different way towards secrecy. Having that in mind and thinking that Valkorion was not only slowly regaining his strength in some hidden planet, but doing what he does best: creating civilizations and amassing power in all its forms, he must have foreseen the new doctrine of the Sith and waited for them to seize control of the Galaxy once again and spread darkness all around as in the ancient times where he was known as Valkorion, to appear and try again to fulfil his desire to be a god once the galactic stage was ready.

As we know, the Dark Side started to grow bigger in the Galaxy before The Phantom Menace, with the corruption of the political system that affected several worlds of the Republic. Then, with the birth of Anakin Skywalker, a product of the most refined Sith Alchemy, a being created though the manipulation of the Force by the Dark Side, the interest of Valkorion over the rest of the Galaxy may have become bigger. Then, with the public reappearance of the Sith on Naboo, he may have started the final preparations for his comeback, helping the Sith plans by feeding them with his own power (the same power Sidious felted in the Unknown Regions and why he put an outpost in Jakkuu) and clear Force Visions. This may have been that way until the last years of the Galactic Empire were the presence of Valkorion, now called Snoke, may have had deceive Sidious into thinking the Rebellion wasn’t a big threat to his rule. Along with that, he may also had helped the Rebellion by over feeding the Emperor with the Dark Side so he may become ever more cruel and evil and thus, focused all the Light Side in the Rebellion and Luke. Then, with this ultimate confrontation between the light and the darkness, the Force should be in balance once again. 

As I have proposed here, that’s the perfect stage of the Force in the Galaxy for Tenebrae/Viciate/Valkorion/Snoke to perform his final ritual, and as we know, not long after the Empire was defeat, the First Order took its place with Snoke at his head. The reason why he had not performed the ritual yet is because of his weak body. For him, Anakin was the perfect vessel, but with the destruction of his body and his premature death on the Second Death Star, then Luke become his target. He felted Snoke, but he wasn’t afraid or tempted by him, because in that time, Snoke was not that powerful with the Force, since he fed so much of his own to Sidious, but he knew how to regain his strength so he commanded the First Order forces to strike the New Republic, to wage war and chaos, so he could drain all that Life Force Energy. Then, the young Ben born, and Snoke took interest in him, because he was young and full of potential. He seduced him, as he has seduced so many others in his long life. Ben was powerful with the Force, like his grandfather, his uncle and his mother and, even though he was surrounded by his love ones, Snoke could deceive him into become a Knight of Ren. He trained him in the ways of the Dark Side and commanded him to kill all the Jedi apprentices of Luke, to grew his hate and to focus the power of the Force in few people, like the Sith did with the rule of two. But even so, the light continued to pull inside him. Snoke knew of this because that was the same flaw of his son Arcann and the solution for that weakness was simple and horrible: to kill all his family. The reason why Snoke want Ben is to pass his Force Essence inside him, but the pull of the light means a willpower, a hope, a threat to him in the process of transference that he had confronted before and lost against it, and in his weak form, he is not going to fall for that again.

Then, years later, he felted a new presence in the Force. A new wielder so powerful its awakening was felted all around the entire Galaxy. Her existence may probably have been foreseen by Snoke time ago and he may be waiting for her to appear (and probably another reason he ordered the destruction of the Jedi was to prevent her from being indoctrinate in the light, and that’s the reason why Luke is so important during The Force Awakens). 

It was Rey. Snoke commanded Kylo Ren to bring her to him. She may be an even better vessel with such raw natural power of the Force in perfect balance, because she wasn’t influenced by the teachings of the light or the dark. He wanted her as unspoiled as possible for that same reason. 

During the events of The Force Awakens Snoke gave the order to attack the New Republic with the Starkiller Base not to make a political statement base on military power, but to feed on the huge amount of Life Force product of the destruction of entire planets. All this to be ready and strong enough to confront Rey and try to mentally control her as he did with Revan and so many others, or to at least steal all her Force Power and Life Force to be even stronger to control Ben.

Finally, regarding Luke, as I said early, he wasn’t afraid of Snoke at first, when he tried to seduce him, but as the time pass he noticed that his power grew stronger and darker to the point it was overwhelming, just before Kylo Ren was sent to destroy the New Jedi Order. He was so afraid of Snoke power that he become to study ancient texts and artefacts of the Jedi and the Sith, searching for knowledge about him or someone of similar power. In that search, he went on to uncovered ancient texts of the primitive ways of the Jedi and the true balance of the Force. For Snoke, Luke represents the biggest threat to his plan of performing the final ritual for the reasons explained before, and because he is afraid Luke may have uncovered his real identity and/or his true intentions for the Galaxy.

For all the reasons explained in this text, I think Snoke must be Tenebrae/Viciate/Valkorion. It would give the Star Wars Universe the most bad ass, evil and manipulator villain of all times. A villain who was the reason for the most tragic and dreadful events of an entire Galaxy for over 5000 years.

THE LAST JEDI trailer directly addresses the two most prominent complaints about THE FORCE AWAKENS (TLJ spoilers),"1. *The Force Awakens* is just a rehash of *A New Hope*

(""This is not going to go the way you think."")

2. Rey is a ""Mary Sue.""

(Luke actually agrees and his fear of her power seems to be a driving theme of the movie.)

They have crushed all the haters with one swift stroke.

What I expect to happen in Episodes VIII and IX after watching the last trailer,"Luke will start training Rey but will freak out once she manifests powers stronger than Kylo's.
PTSD will kick in as he remembers how he was not able to stop Ben from turning to the Dark Side.
Despite Rey's pleadings, he will kick her out after she kicks his ass in training.

Soon after, Kylo will manage to capture Rey and bring her to Snoke.
After Force torturing her, Snoke will convince Rey that he can be the mentor that she so desperately seeks and will turn her to the Dark Side.
Kylo will throw another of his patented Force tantrums out of jaleousy when he realizes that he is no longer Snoke's favorite pupil.

Kylo will then try to go further down the Dark Side rabbit hole by doing the only thing he can think of that will make him more evil (and powerful so that he can become relevant in Snoke's eyes again), e.g. try to kill his mom.
No matter the outcome of this project, this will prove to be a breaking point for Kylo, who will revert to Ben under the crushing weight of his guilt.
Kylo will then go find Luke (maybe Rey will have told Snoke where to find him) and will offer him his help to clean up the mess that they both contributed to make, Kylo by bringing Rey to Snoke, Luke by refusing to train her out of fear.
I imagine the last scene of the movie being Ben extending his hand toward Luke (as seen in the second trailer), mirroring the last scene of TFA when Rey hands the lightsaber to Luke.

Look at it from a script writer's point of view. 
Everybody expects Rey to become a super Force user who will kick the baddies' asses under Luke's tutelage. That's the story that we have been told a zillion times.
The best stories usually involve heroes overcoming impossible odds to triumph over what seems like unstoppable evil.
After defeating Kylo in TFA, there is not much for Rey to do to him that will give the viewers the satisfaction that they seek. It's already been established that she is stronger than him, and TLJ will be all about demonstrating by how much.
By turning things around, we have a much more interesting matchup. 
Two broken, traumatized and guilt-ridden Force users (Luke and Kylo) against the most unstoppable Force users that the galaxy has ever seen (Snoke and Rey).
Even though we can already guess the conclusion of this confrontation, it will be a more interesting journey.
TFA was all about introducing Rey as a hero, and TLJ will be about turning her into a villain. Like Michael Corleone in the first two Godfather movies.

Speculations on what will happen in the third movie.

One of the theories that I've read is that Snoke is an ancient (possibly older than the Jedi order) vampire-like Force user who needs to absorb Luke's life force (well, Force...) in order to regain his full power.
I have no clue why he can't do this to our two Force puppies (Kylo and Rey) though.

Luke will have made it his life mission to find how to defeat Snoke by looking for the first Jedi temple. The book that we see in the trailers is probably the one that holds the information on how to do that.

From what I've read, the first Jedi would have defeated Snoke by turning him into some kind of Force ghost. For some reason, Palpatine's Order 66 would have allowed Snoke to progressively escape his Force prison.

So Snoke would be looking for Luke both to absorb his life force and to eradicate the last remaining threat to his existence. This would explain why Luke went into hiding.

I see the third movie showcasing Rey's efficient training as a Dark Side Force user under the guidance of a very satisfied Snoke. While Kylo's conflicted mind would stop him from achieving his full potential, Rey's lack of significant emotional attachment to anyone would allow her to become the picture perfect ultra focused Dark Force user; she only got to know the characters in TFA for a short time, and Luke is likely the only do-gooder that she will spend (disastrous) time with in TLJ.

Furthermore, Rey's use of the Force in TFA, although done for the greater good, has been flirting dangerously with the Dark Side. While Jedi are all about using the Force in a peaceful state of mind, Rey has only used the Force when scared and angry in TFA. So the bridge to cross to reach the Dark Side is not a long one.

Here's how I imagine the third movie's final showdown. 
Luke and Kylo will faceoff against Snoke and Rey. Expect a few cool Rogue One Vader-like moments when Luke and Kylo slice their way through Stromtroopers to get to the final bosses.
There will of course be the inevitable ""it-is-not-too-late-Rey-the-Dark-Side-is-not-the-answer-see-the-errors-of-your-ways-I-am-so-sorry-for-letting-you-down"" speech.
At some point, Luke will sacrifice himself by letting Snoke absorb him so that Rey can return to the Light Side.
Then Rey and Kylo will kick Snoke's ass using the knowledge acquired from the mysterious book. And possibly Ghost Luke's help.
I don't expect Kylo to survive the battle. Letting him live after murdering his parent(s?) would never be approved by Disney.
 
---

I think that it makes some sense and fits what we've seen in the other two trilogies:

- The strongest Force using protagonist turns to the Dark Side (Anakin/Rey)
- A second movie with a darker tone and an unexpected twist (Vader being Luke's father/Rey ending up being a villain)
- The ultimate baddie is defeated by a pupil turning his/her back to the Dark Side (Vader/Rey/Kylo)
- Luke annoyingly refusing to do what needs to be done (fight Palpatine/train Rey)
- Redemption (Anakin/Ben)
- The bearded mentor sacrificing himself so that youngsters can live (Obi-wan/Luke)

Anyways, rewatching the trailers with these theories in mind works for me.

Theory - Has anyone theorized on the extrapolated parallels between the original Thrawn trilogy and new canon? Is there a nugget in there?,"I read 'Heir to the Empire' when it first came out as a teenager. Then got sidetracked and never finished the series. Then when it was no longer canonical after PT was released, I never went back to it. Last month, I finally read Thrawn. After that, I wanted to go back and listen to the original Heir to the Empire book again. 

Has anyone else found similarities and extractions to the new canon? I could be gripping here, but to me, its apparent that the new canon authors and screen writers may have taken a little inspiration. 

1) Leia pregnant - This leads to our current Ben and then Jaina and Jacen. Interesting parallel...are we all reading too much into the previews? Could it just be that Rey is light and Kylo is dark...period.

2) Luke - we know from the upcoming Legends of Luke Skywalker that he was likely on Jakku for the battle of Jakku. He obviously fought with the New Republic at least for a time. We also know that at some point he went off to locate teachings of the Jedi. This is paralleled in Zahn's books as well. We also know from those books that he dabbled in the darkside...even if at most points they weren't on purpose

3) A dark jedi/fallen jedi - C'boath is found after being a clone of a Jedi killed while travelling to the Unknown Regions. He seeks to train Luke, Leia and the twins. He's incredibly powerful and dangerous. He called to Luke similar to the way that (at least I perceive) Snoke called to Ben Solo. 

Beck and Call - Interesting that this is used in both the original Thrawn trilogy as well as Thrawn

Wayland / Jakku - The emperor left a guardian (dark jedi) at Wayland in the Thrawn trilogy. Wayland being a store house for such tech as cloning cylinders, cloaking devices, etc. Jakku housed a mysterious lab that was guarded by Gallius Rax. 

Here's my bit of speculation - Luke knows Snoke. Luke had Snoke as a sort of advisor on the force. However, Snoke's plans were more nefarious. Snoke is that power referenced by Thrawn in the new book as ""being far more dangerous  than the empire.""

Last Played During KotFE Chapter 9,"So a little over a year ago I started this game after playing KOTOR and KOTOR 2. I was mostly playing for the single player story continuation of those games, but I've been missing it. I only had one character, a Jedi Guardian.

I just went through the process of updating the game. I remember only up to Chapter 9 of KotFE had been released at that point. I was doing heroics to get alliance crates and I had almost all of them to rank 20.

I got my butt kicked in Star Fortresses and kinda just stopped playing. This time around I want to get more into the MMO aspect of the game though, RPing, grouping, PvPing, etc.

So I'm going to play through the remained chapters of KotFE and then start KotET. Is there any reason I should finish up the alliance level ups, or do the alliance alerts before moving on in the story? Or just come back and do them?",swtor,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/75lab4/last_played_during_kotfe_chapter_9/,Question,KingOfKones,75lab4,/r/swtor/comments/75lab4/last_played_during_kotfe_chapter_9/,https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/75lab4/last_played_during_kotfe_chapter_9/,5,2017-10-11

Your Last Jedi thoughts,"What do you guys think Supreme Leader Snoke's grand plan is? 

Besides the obvious motives of galactic domination and dark side powers. What are his main reasons for wanting power? I would love to hear everyone's input. 

I'm personally thinking he wants to have Rey for her force powers so he can ""drain"" it from her. He trains Kylo Ren to make his force powers stronger and once he gets to a certain level Snoke will try to drain him of his powers too.  I believe Snoke regenerates from absorbing it and that's why he looks the way he does. He had been severely damaged and absorbing force essence is the way he regenerates.
 
Sidious always had a plan so I find it hard to believe Snoke doesn't have something up his robe.

Do tell me what you think of my idea and let me know what yours is!

Luke is scared of Rey? Or afraid of Rey becoming a Jedi? Trailer Breakdown,"I have a feeling Luke is scared or afraid of what Rey might be. Trailer Breakdown: 
1. When Rey gives Luke his lightsaber, to me it looks like he is afraid that Rey has showed up.
2. When Rey breaks the ground behind her and Luke, he looks frightened by her power, or astonished on how much she has grown.
3. Luke says ""I’ve seen this raw strength only once before. It didn’t scare me enough then. It does now."" This could mean different things. It could imply that Rey's strength has done enough for Luke to get away back at the temple, then when she shows up to Luke and she shows Luke her power, it scares him more.
4. Following 3, After he says that, Rey looks like she is hanging over an edge of a cliff on the island, looking sad as if she might cry. This could be Rey, following 2, breaking the ground, Luke will get mad at her, and stop the training, hence her crying.
5. Luke says to Rey (I think) that ""This isn't going to go the way you think."" I interpret that as when Luke is training Rey, she does something to upset him, saying that ""its not all fun and games"" and that she has to learn this is serious. He doesn't want Rey to have so much feelings, as we know what happened to Anakin when he was trained.
6. Supposedly, at the end of the movie, Rey says ""I need someone to show me my place in all this"". To me that indicates Luke is no longer training her, refusing to train her. She is sad and depressed. By the time she says this she knows about Kylo Ren and their connection.

This is just a rough prediction on Episode 8 The Last Jedi.",StarWarsTheories,2,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/75qlp5/luke_is_scared_of_rey_or_afraid_of_rey_becoming_a/,,BrenJTW00,75qlp5,/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/75qlp5/luke_is_scared_of_rey_or_afraid_of_rey_becoming_a/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/75qlp5/luke_is_scared_of_rey_or_afraid_of_rey_becoming_a/,1,2017-10-11

The Last Jedi: Poster Theory,"So watching the newest Star Wars trailer had me thinking about how they will present the movie. This is all speculation based on some posters you see inside a movie theater for an upcoming movie. Rey will turn and Kylo Ren will be on the border between evil and good. This is better understood when you find the movie posters of the several characters wearing red hoods. Rey and Kylo are both looking towards our right while all other characters are mostly looking towards our left. Luke and Rey are both looking in opposite directions with their light sabers up and ready. Luke's facing towards a bright light while Rey is putting her back to said light that is being cast upon them. Princess Leia's face is also bright like Luke's and looking in the same direction. Kylo is not even looking back and this suggests his complete assimilation towards the dark side. Yet, his light saber isn't up like Luke or Rey's, Kylo's saber is horizontal. He might be at a border by the end of the movie where he might change sides or he is internally fighting with himself about the choices he has made. This would explain his temper he has shown in the trailer and in ""The Force Awakens."" He is also shown having an emotional reaction before firing at an enemy ship in the most recent trailer as well. Rey was seen asking where she belongs before Kylo Ren is seen next reaching out his hands. This scene might not exist in the movie because the light on Rey's face isn't glowing like she is near a fire. It would be as such because immediately after we are shown Kylo in a burning area. Rey might be speaking to someone outside while the sun is on the horizon. Finn and Poe are also looking towards the left like Luke is but they both are looking back. They might be questioning why Rey betrayed them all and they are in disbelief. 

Sorry about not providing links I didn't think they would work and you would be left reading a failed link. This is the first time I've posted anything on any website ever so apologies if the text wasn't focused enough and if i left anything out.

Last chance jump before next TB,"We are a seasoned guild of guys and girls who are looking for like minded players for Territory Battles. We are almost entirely based in the United States, but we were fortunate enough to have a fellow guildie create the guild in a much more favorable timezone so that we get tickets and new guild activities midday (1230pm EST for reference).

Guild Activity Reset: GMT+4

Rancor: 530pm EST

Tank: 600pm EST

Guild GP: 84.5M

Latest TB: 34* (would have been at 35/36 if not for P4 bugs)

Both raids have a 24 hour registration period, and 1 toon is used to register. For rancor only Kylo and his evil twin brother Zylo are banned as registration characters. CLS is banned from both raids as registration.

Recommended: -Squad synergies that work towards TB (Ex. Zinn/Rebels/Jedi; Phoenix &amp; R1) -Mod challenges complete or mostly complete -Download Discord for chat, with notifications enabled on direct messages &amp; @mentions. -Close to 4,000 tickets a week (We are reasonable if you are afk, just need prior notice) -Swgoh.gg profile for tracking (helps out a lot when asking for advice)

Best IMAX theatre in DC area for Last Jedi?,"So I saw that there are no 70mm screenings of The Last Jedi in the DC area. With that in mind, which theatre would be best to go to, the Airbus theatre or Lockheed Martin theatre? Lockheed is a 15-perf, 70mm film screen, but I guess they’re not showing TLJ in 70mm. Airbus is a digital laser screen.

"[H] Games on Demand (PUBG, Divinity OS 2), Cuphead, Mass Effect Andromeda, Hollow Knight, DeadCells, Rocket League, Owlboy, Total War: Warhammer, XCOM 2, Wolfenstein Games, Left 4 Dead 2, Rogue Legacy, Castle Crashers, Metro Redux Bundle, Over 900 Games/Software/DLC [W] Any Humble Gift Link Offers","----  
**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Furi, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

"[H] Games on Demand (PUBG, Divinity OS 2), Cuphead, Mass Effect Andromeda, Hollow Knight, DeadCells, Rocket League, Owlboy, Total War: Warhammer, XCOM 2, Wolfenstein Games, Left 4 Dead 2, Rogue Legacy, Castle Crashers, Metro Redux Bundle, Over 900 Games/Software/DLC [W] Any Humble Gift Link Offers","----  
**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Furi, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

Loading issues after patch,"Is anyone else having issues after this most recent patch in regards to stuck loading screens?  I returned to the game last week after an extended break and was running through some classic stories, but after the patch, some areas now get stuck on the loading screen just before half completed, and don't finish.  

For example, I can't make a a jedi consular character, I can't load into my jedi knight character, and I can't exit my ship to taris on the inquisitor.  I've been looking around but I can't see anything about this sort of issue.

Thanks",swtor,1,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/75o7cu/loading_issues_after_patch/,Tech Support,Yumstix,75o7cu,/r/swtor/comments/75o7cu/loading_issues_after_patch/,https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/75o7cu/loading_issues_after_patch/,1,2017-10-11
"[H] Games on Demand (PUBG, Divinity OS 2), Cuphead, Mass Effect Andromeda, Hollow Knight, DeadCells, Rocket League, Owlboy, Total War: Warhammer, XCOM 2, Wolfenstein Games, Left 4 Dead 2, Rogue Legacy, Castle Crashers, Metro Redux Bundle, Over 900 Games/Software/DLC [W] Any Humble Gift Link Offers","----  
**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Furi, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

Cosmetic Only Loot Crates Would be Beneficial for Everyone,"In my opinion, EA could actually make MORE money by having RNG loot crates that are COSMETIC ONLY. I mean think about it, basically no on actually is excited about loot crates. The people who hate them obviously won't buy them and everyone who defends loot crates that I've seen say they still won't buy them. If they did cosmetic items, people who be buying crates left and right because one, it's Star Wars and I feel like people would go crazy over cool skins for their favorite characters/ troopers (like clone markings, Luke Skywalker The Last Jedi skin, etc) and stuff like emotes and victory poses. Also, people would buy them because cosmetic only loot crates don't impact the game and are far more pro consumer and people would recognize that, appreciate it, and support it.",StarWarsBattlefront,181,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/75zvvx/cosmetic_only_loot_crates_would_be_beneficial_for/,,iiNovaYT,75zvvx,/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/75zvvx/cosmetic_only_loot_crates_would_be_beneficial_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/75zvvx/cosmetic_only_loot_crates_would_be_beneficial_for/,37,2017-10-12

Raw power,"Interesting that almost every time they mention Rey's power in Databank, it is raw.

""Kylo swore his loyalties were only to Snoke. But he was intrigued when he captured Rey, a Jakku scavenger whose Force abilities were **raw** but very powerful. A mysterious connection seemed to link the two.""

""Rey's Force powers were **raw**, but growing."" 

""Fueled by anger and **raw** power, Rey defeated Kylo.""

[Link](https://imgur.com/a/t523r)

Another interesting thing that I noticed is Kylo's goal.

""A dark side warrior with a mysterious past, Kylo Ren was neither Jedi nor Sith, but a product of both sides’ teachings. Once an apprentice of Luke Skywalker’s, he killed his fellow students and drove Skywalker into exile, becoming a First Order warlord and servant of Supreme Leader Snoke. Kylo was ***determined to destroy the last remnants of the Jedi***, fulfilling the legacy of Darth Vader.""

""Neither Jedi or Sith, Kylo used the pain of his emotional conflict to fuel his extraordinary powers, and **dedicated himself to destroying the last traces of the Jedi tradition**."" 

[Link](https://imgur.com/a/t523r)

Interesting, it seems that both Luke and Kylo want the same thing.

Luke is Snoke's ultimate goal,"**At first** i think Disney marketing team are devil creatures that misdirect, mislead us and shift our focus.

**At second** i think with the new trailer and all that confusion about Rey and Kylo being the OP Force Users we started to forget that the main goal of FO, Kylo and Snoke was to find Luke. The whole movie spinned around this idea.

Just notice how skillfully marketing team shifted our focus from Luke to Rey and Kylo as those who Snoke find as his mcguffins, while in TFA Snoke didn't give a damn about Rey until Kylo randomly found something strange about her, and be honest didn't do anything towards Kylo that make us feel that Kylo is special snowflake with giant potential. Kylo was a useful tool.

Having this in mind, take a look at the new trailer where we heard Snoke's: **""When i found you i saw raw, untamed power and something truly special...""** and then **""Fulfill your destiny""** paralleled visually with Kylo and Rey.

What we did? We jumped on speculations about Kylo and Rey hidden potential. In many cases that new info was confusing especially when the trailer show us scared weak Luke.

 ""How those two are more powerful than Anakin's son Luke???""
Answer is simple.

**They aren't.**

Thats the trick i talked about. Misdirection, misleading, shifting the focus.

If we'll put aside them and take into account everything we fond out in TFA, we will be able to see things clear and logically right.

 I won't go into details since they weren't revealed yet, so **just an outline now.**

When Luke defeated Emperor, saved the father and became the Jedi, some ancient creature beyond the Unknown Region felt the changes in the Force. He found the source of these changes in Luke. That creature, named Snoke, saw in Luke raw untamed power and something truly special. And thats right. Luke was a Jedi after RotJ but he wasn't studied enough to be the Master of the Force. And he was the son of Chosen One, the most powerful Force User of (not that important) all times. 

Since then, Snoke began his journey. He wanted to get Luke, and earlier or later, Luke found out Snoke's presence. It doesnt mater, during what stage he did it. 

Snoke made his move, and destroyed New Academy, and took away Kylo.
Thats when Luke realized that creature wants to get him. Thats why Luke escaped and hide on Ach-To. Maybe Acho-To has some sort of defense from Snoke, as its the place where was built the first Jedi Temple.

Here comes The Last Jedi. **Snoke wants to make Luke reveal himself. Kylo and Rey are potent Force Users, but they are not OP prodigies as trailer suggests. They are tools in the hands of Snoke.**

And thats why he ordered Kylo to kidnap Rey. Not to do something evil with Rey. **Snoke wants Luke to leave Ach-To to rescue Rey.**

And i bet that what he will get by the end of the TLJ. I will be not surprised if Luke is in that scene where Snoke tortures Rey, behind the shot. 

""Fullfill your destiny"", - Snoke tells to Luke who stands before him. 

That scene mirrors both ESB, RotJ and RotS scenes, where Vader and Palpatine used third persons (Leia and Han/Vader/Palpatine) as the leverage to turn the focus person (Luke/Luke/Anakin) to the Dark Side.
Its like a poetry, it rhymes. Luke comes to the rescue to save Rey, but instead falls in trap and being tempted by the Dark Side User.

**Thats Snoke's ultimate goal. He sees in Luke the power of Anakin, and he wants to use it for own sake.**",starwarsspeculation,26,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75tbfb/luke_is_snokes_ultimate_goal/,THEORY,Harbournessrage,75tbfb,/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75tbfb/luke_is_snokes_ultimate_goal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75tbfb/luke_is_snokes_ultimate_goal/,18,2017-10-12

3 things to watch for tonight (from Eagles fan who lives in Charlotte),"Hey, I am a huge Eagles fan living in Charlotte so I have seen probably 50-60 Cam Newton games beginning to end in the last 5 or 6 years.  It's not a small sample size. 

Here are three things to watch out for as a fan.

1. Cam's velocity seems to be angel soft lobs or 90 mile an hour Randy Johnson fastballs.  His fast throws help him get away with ill advised passes to guys who aren't open...but they get the ball because it's so damn fast. Kind of like how Ryan Howard on the Phillies was so strong he could hit a home run off of a low outside ball...off the tip of the bat.  Speed kills.  
HOWEVER*
The velocity comes back to bite him on short passes because when the ball gets tipped, it careens 40 feet straight up in the air a few times a game and it becomes a tip drill straight from Madden 2002 hell.  The whole defense stares up at the ball and waits patiently...

2. Cam is FAR more likely to take off when the potential throw requires him to cross his body.  If we pressure him, watch for D to pressure him to his LEFT.  Going left makes him want to jet.  He has done well going to his left like his touchdown to Ed Dickson last week, but that was a designed bootleg and he had no Lions players nearby.    

3. Cam doesn't move very suddenly in the pocket. He's fast, but he's not ""sudden.""  He stands very non-chalantly, very casual.  He can tuck it like the best of them, but in the pocket he glides backwards for a while and will take a sack once in a while when throwing it away seemed possible.  
The Eagles must be disciplined though because Cam doesn't need a lot of windup on his throws.  He can correct his feet and shoulders and drive a 70 yard pass in the air--I've seen him.  Rivers and Manning hit 70 yard bombs on us but Cam can get it there with a lot of ease compared to those elder QBs.  
      I will be getting loud in the 508 section in my Wentz jersey next to a girl dressed like a Jedi. Maybe you'll see me on TV.  My pick for the game is Eagles 30 Panthers 20.  BONUS: The panthers drafted Kenjon Barner and it would be tragically ironic if he became a difference maker in this game. They never gave him much respect in Carolina so watch him play his ass off against his old team with a couple of big punt returns that could prove instrumental in an Eagles win.  Go Birds

What if Luke tried to train Kylo as first Grey Jedi (or somehow balanced force user) and it went bad?,"From databank (last screen https://imgur.com/a/t523r) about Kylo Ren: 

""A dark side warrior with a mysterious past, Kylo Ren was neither Jedi nor Sith, but a product of both sides’ teachings. Once an apprentice of Luke Skywalker’s, he killed his fellow students and drove Skywalker into exile, becoming a First Order warlord and servant of Supreme Leader Snoke. Kylo was determined to destroy the last remnants of the Jedi, fulfilling the legacy of Darth Vader.""
""Neither Jedi or Sith, Kylo used the pain of his emotional conflict to fuel his extraordinary powers, and dedicated himself to destroying the last traces of the Jedi tradition.""

What if Luke learned about balance and how it must be preserved. He learned something like the stronger is the force wielder the bigger threat HIS anger is. And at some point in life everyone is getting mad - so Luke thought that he should learn him how to controll his anger. This is my guessing, bringing shit out of hat etc. but the core of my theory is that...

Luke did want to teach him both about light and dark side, Kylo was kind of Lukes experiment that went bad - he could not controll his power and destroyed everything. It would make both Lukes and Kylos fail. Somehow Kylo could not embrace the dark side and went mad destroying the temple. After the failure Luke went on exile and Kylo felt guilty because he was not strong enough to controll himself. So to finish his training and to prove he is not a dissapointment he HAD to embrace the Dark Side and he needed a teacher. Luke did not know much about the Dark Side and also withdraw so the only option for Kylo was Snooke. And look how desperate Kylo is to do ""dark side things"". He even killed (or more like forced himself to) his own father so he could ""learn the dark side"".

Not Speculation - Where did this fascination with all the OT people dying come from?,"Like, would anyone be pissed if 'The Last Jedi' died? Every conclusion I've read is Han, Luke, Leia are dead. Great. 

We Killed off Han

Leia died due to uh... offscreen issues I'm sure it will be explained in VIII.

Does luke **have to die**? Can he just be a Jedi Master?

Luke and Snoke’s fear,"I’ve been worried about how Luke is going to be portrayed in The Last Jedi. He’s the hero for me. I’ve been worried he’s been put into the back seat just so the other characters can breathe. 

But, it’s Snoke’s words in the TFA that give me heart. Snoke seems generally afraid and worried of Luke returning. He literally wants to bring the FO out of hiding to destroy the resistance before they reach Skywalker. 

I don’t know what this means other than Snoke is clearly worried about Luke returning. That makes me equally concerned to know what is keeping him away.

"Art of misdirection: Are we looking at the wrong person, Rey, being tempted by the dark side?","Because the one I suspect to be tempted and possibly seduced is Luke Skywalker. The poster is telling: Luke is up in the background, assuming the kind of position you'd expect from a Darth Vader, or as we saw in The Force Awakens, Kylo Ren. His face is divided by blue, Rey, and red, Kylo, with the two facets representing good and evil. What I interpret from it is the film is less about Rey's struggle and more about Luke's. Luke is divided by the two sides trying to fight for his soul. Who gets to keep Luke? Who will seduce Luke into joining their cause? 

He's disappointed with the force, he lost Kylo, he isolated himself from the world  and here comes a young girl asking for Luke's assistance. Maybe his isolation comes from knowing by coming back, he's risking his own sanity by possibly embracing the dark side. After all, he's his son's father and madness can be hereditary. If Han Solo and possibly Leia die, he might give up on the force. Heroes broken by tragedy have occasionally embraced evil due to anger. It is what led Anakin Skywalker into embracing the dark side. 

The current trilogy has played before with misdirection. In The Force Awakens we were meant to believe Finn was the chosen on and it turned out to be Rey. With The Last Jedi, we're being meant to assume Rey is embracing the dark side along Kylo Ren yet viewers have pointed out their scenes are not connected which means Star Wars is trying to fool us.

Kylo Ren will attempt to save Leia before she is killed,"Anyone else getting this vibe? I could just be naively formulating an idea that counters what I think is misdirection in the trailer (I.e. Kylo Den apparently killing Leia), but I have this suspicion that Kylo, although not turning back to the light, will move towards a more ambiguous place in relation to the force and it's uses. I think one way to show that turn, something that would invoke both a rejection of the dark AND the light side would be to show him in some way making a last minute change of heart to save Leia, only before seeing her killed by a member of the first order. Maybe even Snoke. Not only would this leave him fuming against the first order, but I think he would feel a sense of futility in turning to the light as well, as look where it got his Mother. This pressure cooker formed by the rejection of two polarities would leave him with no choice but to forge a new path in the force. 

This is, perhaps, where Rey's story developes as well, as it seems as though she too might end up forging her own way. Remember, she has yet to commit herself fully to the light, as she had not even begun training with the force in the first episode. I can see Luke's fear and apparent fragility turning her off of following that path. With Luke the only remaining Jedi, it would appear that the appeal that was once serving the light side is dying alongside our beloved Skywalker. Not to mention the title of the next story is The Last Jedi.

Really what I'm saying here is nothing new. We all know about this idea of the ""grey"". I just think I might have a cool idea as to how this idea finds its way into the hearts of Kylo and Rey.

I also think that this idea of rejecting polarities and finding wisdom in the middle way is something our culture, and by that I mean the modern day western world, is influencing our political, social, and artistic spheres more than ever before (I say that with caution as I recognize that the West is built up of many cultures), so it would make sense that this movie, placing a strong, albeit indirect, emphasis on eastern spirituality would take that route. 

What I'm saying is I know that the writers know that the old light vs dark thing doesn't really provide much depth anymore. That's what separates a franchise like StarWars from the superhero franchises we see pumped out like stale cum every year.

ANYWAYS tell me what you think! Personally I think going in this direction would be awesome and would open up so many creative doors that could lead to a whole new take on the star wars universe. Something that would redeem and connect every single Star Wars story, tv show, and movie all at once.

[Speculation] The Burning Temple: Not a vision of the past?,"In *The Force Awakens*, Rey has visions when she picks up Luke's old lightsaber. Some are from the past - certainly the hallway of Cloud City and little Rey being left on Jakku; the shots of the Knights of Ren in the rain and Luke sitting down by R2's side watching the burning temple have also been considered to be in the past. But what if these two last were visions of the future, and that we'll see these scenes come to life in *The Last Jedi*?

There is a shot in the new trailer of Luke on the ground (when he says ""This is not going to go the way you think""), notice the colors of nighttime and the rain - visually it lines up with the vision of the Knights of Ren, no?

Then we have the shot of Luke's mechanical hand as he tries to get out of debris/rubble - and we've heard rumors of an ""exploding hut"".

And we have seen in the trailer that Rey's power is so *raw* it can crack open the ground, to Luke's astonishment. 

So.. what if Kylo and the Knights appear on Ach-Tho in Episode VIII during the night/rain...a fight ensues...Rey gets sufficiently ignited and things begin to explode and catch fire, resulting in a building (hut?) collapsing on Luke. 

What if, since we haven't seen much of Ach-Tho/the island yet, the temple we saw burning in the vision isn't Luke's new order's temple, but the First Jedi Temple - the temple Luke went looking for in the first place? 

So Luke gets out of the debris, staggers over to R2-D2, sits down by his side, and pats his shiny metal dome.

(Meanwhile, Key may have taken off with Rey - presumably to Snoke, as we've seen Snoke and Rey together).

Luke is left on Ach-Tho wondering what the heck just happened and realizes he can't stay out of it any longer. As we know he's got a submerged X-Wing, so he'll raise that (and *this* time he won't fail) to get himself off-planet, to show up in the nick of time later in the film. 

(As an additional thought, with Rey's powers being so raw, what if *she*, as a small child, was the one who destroyed Luke's order? When Luke says he has seen such power only once before, it could basically mean he's talking about *her*. It would also help explain - maybe - why she was sent to a super-isolated world.)

Anyway, just some quick thoughts. Feasible? Impossible? 

Edit:
This would also explain why Johnson asked Abrams to put R2 in the Falcon with Rey and Chewie and not BB8 as originally intended: Johnson decided to put the temple/rain scenes into TLJ and so he would need R2 by Luke's side",starwarsspeculation,6,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75v4ku/speculation_the_burning_temple_not_a_vision_of/,SPECULATION,YouveBeenKitFistoed,75v4ku,/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75v4ku/speculation_the_burning_temple_not_a_vision_of/,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/75v4ku/speculation_the_burning_temple_not_a_vision_of/,8,2017-10-12

Empire at War event,"Yes. Star Wars comics are currently published by Marvel (though they've floated around over the years). Yes, I know how unlikely/impossible this is. I don't care. This event would pay homage to my favorite technically-but-not-really-a Marvel thing. :)

* Recruit rebel heroes like Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia Organa, and more  
* Battle the Galactic Empire to free Luke Skywalker  
* Collect exclsive outfits for Iron Man, Wasp, Falcon, and Tigra

# The Story  
A rebellion plot has backfired, and the Empire has captured Jedi-in-training Luke Skywalker, as well as scattered many of the rebel generals and other forces. Han Solo seeks the aid of Avengers Academy to reunite the rebellion and rescue Skywalker before he's turned over to the Emperor.

# Week 1  
Han Solo and Chewbacca arrive at the Academy and begin coming up with a rescue plan. Fury is hesitant to deal with someone he has yet to monitor. Tony vows to assist the rebels, with or without Fury's help.

* Event building: Millennium Falcon, drops materials needed to recruit Han Solo. Provides actions for Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, Lando, Luke, and R2-D2.  
* *Event exclusive action:* Recon. Send up to two characters on recon missions in the Millennium Falcon for 2/4 hours to retrieve Rebel Caches, which contain items needed to fight, recruit and upgrade characters, and craft costumes. Each cache also includes map fragments, which will be required to rescue Luke Skywalker. Requires Fuel, obtained from the mission board.  
* Premium character: Chewbacca. Can perform the Recon action on the Millennium Falcon immediately. Can perform an action at HQ to earn combat skills for week 1 and week 2 fighters.  
* F2P Character: Han Solo. Has a chance of retrieving twice the number of Rebel Caches when paired with Chewbacca.  
* Boss: Grand Moff Tarkin. After beating streak 1, he retreats and no longer appears on the mission board. Drops the last piece needed to create...  
* F2P Costume: Rebellion Iron Man. A throwback to the Clone Wars days, this suit has been completely repurposed and fitted with the best tech Stark Industries has to offer. Allows Iron Man to go on Recon missions.  
* F2P Goal: Go on 100 Recon missions to unlock the Chewbacca bobblehead.  
* P2P Goal: Get 3 stars on all Heroic missions on the fight board to unlock Bounty Hunter Loki. This will give Loki an enhanced combat type and allow him to fight for the remainder of the event.

# Week 2  
Han and Tony have located Princess Leia. To rescue her and bring her into the Academy, they need to outmaneuver the nefarious bounty hunter, Boba Fett. Luckily, Tony has some tricks up his sleeve that could turn the odds in their favor.

* Event building: Rebel base. Drops items needed to recruit Leia Organa. Exclusive buddy action for Leia and Han at the Rebel Base.  
* Boss: Boba Fett. The illustrious bounty hunter has trapped Leia on his ship, but defeating him will give you the last item you need to rescue...  
* F2P Character: Leia Organa. Improves the rate of week 2 items in Rebel Caches when paired with anyone.  
* F2P Costume: Rebel Captain Rogers. Defeating Boba Fett streak 5 on normal difficulty will unlock the materials needed to get Captain America into the fight for the remainder of the event. What? Not in a crate? That's right. We're saving the *good* stuff for the crate.  
* Rebellion Crate: Featuring galactic-themed decorations, event currency, returning characters Agent 13, Hank Pym, M.O.D.O.K., and Cosmo the Spacedog, and *Rebel General Carter*. If you don't already have Peggy Carter, collecting this costume will unlock her. The Rebellion General costume will give Peggy an enhanced combat type and allow her to fight for the remainder of the event.  
* F2P Goal: Defeat Imperial Stormtroopers 150 times. Unlocks Han Solo bobblehead.  
* P2P Goal: Defeat Heroic Boba Fett streak 5. Unlocks Bounty Hunter Falcon. This will give Falcon an enhanced combat type and allow him to fight for the remainder of the event.

# Week 3  
Boba Fett is defeated. Knowing the punishment for failure, he considers his options. On one hand, he could go back to the Empire and risk being made into a human tesla coil. On the other hand, he could hang around the Academy, compare arms and tactics with Frank Castle (and make fun of Hawkeye together). That doesn't sound so bad.

* F2P Costume: Rebel Spy Black Widow. Going undercover as an Imperial officer, Widow is ready to get some intel on where Luke is holed up at.  
* Premium Character: R2-D2. Can perform an action at HQ to earn combat skills for all week 3 and week 4 fighters. Also doubles the amount of map fragments from Rebel Caches.  
* Boss: Grand Moff Tarkin. Tarkin is back, and this time he has the backup of some of the Empire's finest sharpshooters. Defeat an increasing number of sharpshooters to progress in ranks with Tarkin. Streak 3 will give you enough materials to recruit...  
* F2P Character: Boba Fett. Fett has no actions at the Millennium Falcon and can't go on recon missions, but unlocking his rank 3 will convert him into an enhanced combat type.  
* F2P Goal: Raise three characters to attack and health level 7 or higher. Unlocks Princess Leia bobblehead.  
* P2P Goal: Collect 75 stars in heroic missions. Unlocks Bounty Hunter Tigra. This will give Tigra an enhanced combat type and allow her to fight for the remainder of the event. If you don't have Tigra unlocked, this costume will be waiting in VanDyne's until you unlock her.

# Week 4  
The rebels receive a distress signal from the outer rim and trace it back to Lando Calrissian. He has information on Luke's current location, but the Empire is close to capturing him. Not only that, he sounds *really* cute. Cue a costume change and Wasp entering the fight!

* F2P Costume: Scout Wasp. This suit is flattering without being overbearing. It's what *all* the fashionable rebels are wearing these days.  
* Galactic Freedom Crate. This crate brings the best of the best back to Avengers Academy. Get a chance to recruit Captain Marvel, Singularity, Nova, Star Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot. Also, outfit your new recruits with the Galactic Star Lord, Galactic Drax, Galactic Gamora, Galactic Rocket, and Thor Groot costumes!
* Boss: Darth Vader. The Sith Lord brings with him a batallion of Stormtroopers that increases with each streak, much like Tarkin. Defeating streak 3 unlocks the materials needed to recruit...  
* F2P Character: Lando Calrissian. One of the best-looking smugglers this side of Corellia. Sending Lando on a recon mission with anyone will increase the amount of Week 3 *and* week 4 materials received.  
* Heroic Boss: Emperor Palpatine. Only the bravest should be tackling on this menace.  
* F2P Goal: Open 20 week 4 Rebel Caches. Unlocks the Luke Skywalker bobblehead.  
* P2P Goal: Defeat Emperor Palpatine streak 1. Unlocks Bounty Hunter Taskmaster. This will give Taskmaster an enhanced combat type and allow him to fight for the remainder of the event. If you don't have Taskmaster unlocked, this costume will be waiting in VanDyne's until you unlock him.

# End Goals

* F2P: Complete all goals to recruit the C-3PO Character. This character has exclusive buddy actions with R2-D2 and Luke Skywalker.  
* P2P: Complete all goals to recruit Darth Vader. This character has exclusive buddy actions with Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker.  
* Grand Prize: Unlock all F2P characters, challenges and costumes and collect enough map fragments from the Rebel Caches to recruit Luke Skywalker.",avengersacademygame,6,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/avengersacademygame/comments/75xlq5/empire_at_war_event/,Fanwork,JaxxisR,75xlq5,/r/avengersacademygame/comments/75xlq5/empire_at_war_event/,https://www.reddit.com/r/avengersacademygame/comments/75xlq5/empire_at_war_event/,7,2017-10-12

Ben Solo is a double agent working for Luke,"I originally posted this theory a couple of months ago, but I've made a few upgrades since then. I cobbled this together based on what we know from the movies, what we've learned from the official information released by Lucasfilm and what rumor's I've heard online. I know it's not perfect and it has some holes, but let me know if you think I'm on the right track or barking up the wrong tree. 

&gt;

#Ben and Luke's history and The Plan

Han and Leia send Ben to train with Luke because of the ""raw power"" he possesses and it's beyond Leia's ability to handle based on her very limited training. Luke trains Ben (and others), but in the process, The First Order starts causing trouble. Luke and Ben learn that Snoke is in control and he's the one who's been after Ben his entire life, trying to seduce him to the dark side. 6 years prior to the destruction of Starkiller Base, the galaxy learns that Luke and Leia are the children of Darth Vader. This is information that was previously unknown to Ben, but he doesn't react as violently to that news as some would assume. In the wake of this news, Leia leaves the New Republic senate to start her resistance against the growing First Order. Luke knows that the Republic isn't willing to fight the FO and Leia's forces aren't strong enough to do much damage, so he and Ben hatch a plan. 

Ben will go to Snoke and ask to be trained, gaining Snoke's trust and influence in the FO, then when the time is right, Ben kills Snoke and destroys the First Order (with or without Luke's help). What Luke didn't plan on was what lengths Kylo Ben would have to go to in order to convince Snoke of his loyalty and he never anticipates Kylo going rogue from their original plan. As one of the steps to convince Snoke of his loyalty Kylo has to go to Luke's tempe with the other Knights of Ren and wipe out all his former friends and fellow Jedi. 

Luke was there during the attack, sees what Ben did but chose to do nothing because he didn't want to risk jeopardizing the plan. 

After crawling out of the rubble and seeing the amount of destruction that Kylo brought with him, Luke realizes that he's directly responsible for all the lives that Kylo has extinguished during his time with Snoke. His carelessness and huberus, thinking that he knew the limits of what Ben was capable of scares Luke and he runs away, questioning everything he thought he kew about himself and the Jedi path.

During their adventures together in previous years, Ben and Luke discovered the location of the first Jedi temple. Luke goes there looking for answers about the teaching of the Jedi and the nature of the Force in general. In the process, he finds something that he doesn't like and a greater truth about the nature of the Force becomes apparent, causing Luke to stay hidden while he reconciles what he just learned. Luke is in an identity crisis/ crisis of faith. 

Meanwhile, Kylo/Ben is still on the inside waiting for the moment to strike, but he darkness keeps creeping in as he gets further and further into Snoke's grasp. We know that Kylo isn't rotten to the core because he admits that he feels the pull of the light and we learn in the novelization that killing Han didn't push him over into complete darkness The light is still there. Ben idolizes his grandfather because no matter how how deep he got into the grasp of Palpatine and the darkness, he still found the strength to destroy the Sith in the end. That's why Kylo is distraught when Rey tells him that he's afraid that he will never be as strong as Darth Vader. He tells Han that he knows what he has to do, but doesn't know if he has the strength to do it. He knows that he has to go deeper to gain Snoke's trust, but doesn't want to kill his father. I think that Han and Ben had an unspoken moment where Han knew what Kylo had to do and why he had to do it. Kylo telling Rey during their fight that ""you need a teacher. I can show you the ways of the Force"" is a subtle plea to help him defeat Snoke. Kylo clearly knows who she is and knows that she could be an important ally in destroying the dark side, but he couldn't risk blowing his cover by telling her outright then and there. Even though the planet is collapsing, Snoke still has eyes and ears everywhere on that world.

#The events of The Last Jedi:  

Rey finds Luke and asks him to come with her to Leia and fight on behalf of the Reisstance. Luke flat out refuses. Rey is caught off guard by this and becomes disappointed when she starts learning that the legendary Luke Skywalker isn't the kind of person she always herd that he was. In a desperate attempt to not leave empty handed she asks him to train her. The awakening of the Force within Rey frightens her and leaves her questioning her place in the galaxy and she pleas with Luke to help her. Luke initially refuses because he is ashamed of the deaths he caused by sending Ben to Snoke and he doesn't want to do something like that to Rey. 

Slowly, Rey begins to appeal to Luke's compassionate nature and he agrees to begin teaching her. He starts with basic meditation techniques, but he sees in her the same raw power and potential that he once saw in his former apprentice. This frightens Luke even further and he retreats. Over time, Rey slowly convinces Luke to begin helping her again and admits that she is confused about how Luke has been acting. Luke educates Rey about her past (whatever that may be), her connection to the Force and what he has learned about the nature of the Force itself. After all that, Luke and Rey have a heart to heart and Luke agrees to train Rey, but in a way different from all the other's he trained before her. 

At this same time, Kylo retreats back to the stronghold of the First Order where he is summoned by Snoke. Snoke speaks to him about the potential he saw within Kylo many years before, but he is concerned that the same sentimentality that brought about Vader's downfall and the destruction of the old Empire is growing within Kylo. Kylo assures Snoke that he is loyal and that he has no feelings for his family. To prove this, Snoke orders Kylo to lead the strike to destroy the Resistance at their base (and spicifically his mother). Kylo agrees, comes within a hairs breadth of cutting the head off the leadership of the Resistance, but pulls away at the last moment. He shares the same kind of psychic connection with Leia that she shares with Luke. She lets him know that she still loves him and that is all it too to break Kylo's resolve, allowing the Resistance to escape and regroup.

Kylo can't return to Snoke with another failure on his hands, so he makes the decision to track down Luke and form a new plan.  Kylo (maybe with some of his cronies, sent by Snoke to keep an eye on him) finds where Luke has been hiding (probably through tracking the Falcon, but partially since he may have been there before). They begin looking for Luke and Rey. He finds them and action ensues. Kylo corners Rey and tells her about the plan that he and Luke hatched years before. She has a moment of crisis, but ultimately decides to take a chance on him and they go find Luke. Luke gets angry because of lengths that Kylo has gone to gain Snoke's trust and he's afraid that he's going to loose both of them to Snoke if they try to use the same plan. Rey wants to help Kylo, Luke won't allow it. Through a display of power, he forces Kylo to leave. 

[This is where I'm still working on putting the pieces together]

Luke continues to train Rey until he believes she is ready to go back to the Resistance. At this point, they both head for Crait where a showdown between the First Order and Resistance is about to happen. Luke and Leia reunite one last time before the battle begins. Luke and Rey join in the battle until Kylo Ren arrives. Against Luke's wishes, Rey asks Kylo to take her to Snoke. He agrees and Snoke tortures Rey to for her to submit to the dark side. Luke senses what has happened and gives chase. 

[I think that the film will end around this point and on a cliff hanger once again]

&gt;

So, what do you think? Does it make sense? How can I improve it with more facts and *credible* rumors? 

Thanks!

Disney might be learning a thing or two,"So I've been reading a lot about how TFA figures were still in stores a year after they dropped due to Disney mass producing and swarming shelves. Looking at the last Jedi, even though I would like better quality, I think Disney is making better choices with the action figure line. Maybe it's just my local target but I see a lot more 7.99 figures opposed to the 8.99/9.99 I saw last year. There's a lot less of these stupid (in my opinion) accessories like rocket launchers and ""gear"" that have no relation to the character at all. There also seems to be less unnecessary Star Wars merchandise in the aisles like Star Wars bouncy balls and weird crap like that. I'm a fan of this new line.

TLJ Theory: Kylo/Ben is a double agent working for Luke.,"I cobbled this together based on what we know from the movies, what we've learned from the official information released by Lucasfilm and what rumor's I've heard online. I know it's not perfect and it has some holes, but let me know if you think I'm on the right track or barking up the wrong tree. 

&gt;
#Ben and Luke's history and The Plan

Han and Leia send Ben to train with Luke because of the ""raw power"" he possesses and it's beyond Leia's ability to handle based on her very limited training. Luke trains Ben (and others), but in the process, The First Order starts causing trouble. Luke and Ben learn that Snoke is in control and he's the one who's been after Ben his entire life, trying to seduce him to the dark side. 6 years prior to the destruction of Starkiller Base, the galaxy learns that Luke and Leia are the children of Darth Vader. This is information that was previously unknown to Ben, but he doesn't react as violently to that news as some would assume. In the wake of this news, Leia leaves the New Republic senate to start her resistance against the growing First Order. Luke knows that the Republic isn't willing to fight the FO and Leia's forces aren't strong enough to do much damage, so he and Ben hatch a plan. 

Ben will go to Snoke and ask to be trained, gaining Snoke's trust and influence in the FO, then when the time is right, Ben kills Snoke and destroys the First Order (with or without Luke's help). What Luke didn't plan on was what lengths Kylo Ben would have to go to in order to convince Snoke of his loyalty and he never anticipates Kylo going rogue from their original plan. As one of the steps to convince Snoke of his loyalty Kylo has to go to Luke's tempe with the other Knights of Ren and wipe out all his former friends and fellow Jedi. 

Luke was there during the attack, sees what Ben did but chose to do nothing because he didn't want to risk jeopardizing the plan. 

After crawling out of the rubble and seeing the amount of destruction that Kylo brought with him, Luke realizes that he's directly responsible for all the lives that Kylo has extinguished during his time with Snoke. His carelessness and huberus, thinking that he knew the limits of what Ben was capable of scares Luke and he runs away, questioning everything he thought he kew about himself and the Jedi path.

During their adventures together in previous years, Ben and Luke discovered the location of the first Jedi temple. Luke goes there looking for answers about the teaching of the Jedi and the nature of the Force in general. In the process, he finds something that he doesn't like and a greater truth about the nature of the Force becomes apparent, causing Luke to stay hidden while he reconciles what he just learned. Luke is in an identity crisis/ crisis of faith. 

Meanwhile, Kylo/Ben is still on the inside waiting for the moment to strike, but he darkness keeps creeping in as he gets further and further into Snoke's grasp. We know that Kylo isn't rotten to the core because he admits that he feels the pull of the light and we learn in the novelization that killing Han didn't push him over into complete darkness The light is still there. Ben idolizes his grandfather because no matter how how deep he got into the grasp of Palpatine and the darkness, he still found the strength to destroy the Sith in the end. That's why Kylo is distraught when Rey tells him that he's afraid that he will never be as strong as Darth Vader. He tells Han that he knows what he has to do, but doesn't know if he has the strength to do it. He knows that he has to go deeper to gain Snoke's trust, but doesn't want to kill his father. I think that Han and Ben had an unspoken moment where Han knew what Kylo had to do and why he had to do it. Kylo telling Rey during their fight that ""you need a teacher. I can show you the ways of the Force"" is a subtle plea to help him defeat Snoke. Kylo clearly knows who she is and knows that she could be an important ally in destroying the dark side, but he couldn't risk blowing his cover by telling her outright then and there. Even though the planet is collapsing, Snoke still has eyes and ears everywhere on that world.

There's like a 99% chance that Snoke is Plagueis. Master Theory Thread,"I feel that I can sum Plagueis theory up in a way that ties up every loose end. I've always felt pretty strongly about this one. It makes a lot more sense than the others.

**NOTE ON THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THE EU**

These are the main films. Plagueis is the *only* major development in all the main Star Wars movie line that Snoke has a chance to be. If you don't tie all three trilogies together, you're creating loose ends.

**EU is likely to be used as inspiration, and some vague pieces of the EU are likely to become canon.** This is exactly what it would be for Snoke to be non-Muun that somehow looks like a Muun.

Snoke=Plagueis is also a great way to add some depth to the prequel trilogies, which, lets face it, not everyone likes.

**MUSIC**

No one explains the music as well as it needs to be, hence it being posted here. No one seems to understand the significance of the music in this case. It's not some weird shit, and it's not even the ""well it's deep bass choral music."" It's the SAME MOTIF.

https://youtu.be/mSQ3BJVMfAI?t=1m18s

Speed that line up at 1:20 to 2x so you can hear the motif easily, rhythm and everything, since it's so slow otherwise.

https://youtu.be/HLfGh2b_me0?t=2m20s

Then listen to that theme.

IT'S THE SAME MOTIF. **The only time you hear the words ""Darth Plagueis"" in all of the Star Wars movies, you hear the motif that also happens to be the main motif of Snoke!** It's like the line ""Darth Plagueis the Wise"" starts the motif, which you only hear once, with his fricking name!

It's not just ""some random evil theme."" It's THE motif, and the prequel triology realizes the whole theme that the Plagueis motif is built off of.

This CANNOT be a coincidence unless John Williams one day decided ""I think I'm going to be a hack for the last Star Wars movies and reuse this theme that I wrote myself for the biggest trilogy of all time.""

**SNOKE REGENERATED**

This is a power that only Darth Plagueis is thought to have - ""to create... life"" as Palpatine said it.

[THIS](http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/star-wars-the-last-jedi-snoke-slice-600x200.jpg) is clearly a regenerated version of [this.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4f/Snoke-The_Force_Awakens_%282015%29.png)

**WHEN I FOUND YOU**

When Snoke says this line in the trailer, [we see a shot of Kylo Ren...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0CbN8sfihY).

Looking a lot like [this guy...](http://s.storage.akamai.coub.com/get/b54/p/coub/simple/cw_timeline_pic/f64c2c93372/2c6936e52cf17703f257c/big_1466368124_image.jpg)

Plagueis would have certainly known about Anakin. He may have found Anakin as well, so... ""found you"" referring to Kylo, Rey and Anakin would be pretty interesting. It's been implied that Plagueis may have been involved in the conception of Anakin.

**AWKWARD PANEL QUESTION**

https://youtu.be/8fMx670jOnw?t=38m3s

""Is there going to be any mention of Darth Plagueis,"" says the Jonathan, the questioner. As he says this, all four panel members in view stop moving, clearly tense, as if to suppress anything that might come out. Oscaar Isaac raises his eyebrows, feeling a slight bit of surprised and shock, quickly suppressing it. ""...in Episode 7, maybe surrounding a certain staff that someone finds?""

""Is that S-"" says Daisey Ridley, catching herself.

""La... Larry!"" J.J. Abrams says, in a hurried, frantic fashion. ""Do you wanna answer that?"" catching his cool, like the smooth, storyline hiding world class director that he is.

""I don't think I heard correctly... is it Darth Vegas? Like... Las Vegas?"" says Kasdan, totally diverting the question.

J.J. Abrams quickly bites his lip in irritation, thinking ""you're not doing this right dude, this is too obvious of a deflection,"" while still laughing along with Kasdan.

""Darth... Vader?"" Kasdan trails off as John Boyega tries to help, missing Kasdan's misdirection:

""Plagueis,"" says Boyega, lightly, as Kasdan clearly ignores him, suppressing his reactions, a key indication of someone in the act of deceiving.

""No-he's-uh-Larry's messing with you. I don't think we wanna be talking about story too much, too soon, but, uhhhhhh, I will say... No."" just as the panel loosens up, as J.J. took the lead and handled the situation, ending further probing. Daisey Ridley laughs, releasing some of her tension. Boyega and Kasdan throw their heads back in relief, now that J.J. has removed the  pressure over a probing question that got too close.

Daisey Ridley laughs

**THE SUPREME LEADER IS WISE**

Obviously awkward line to say ""The Supreme Leader is Wise.""

By the way, the subreddit The Supreme Pablo was started when I, posting on a different account, responded to a thread saying ""The Pablo is Wise"" and I corrected them with ""The Supreme Pablo,"" so, I may have been the originator of that. Lol.

Also, Pablo denied it because beating around the bush is just too obvious, as another user mentioned.

**SNOKE JUST LOOKS LIKE A PLAGUEIS... COME ON**

He's sickly, ugly and decrepit. Palpatine was too, but he was thicker and more ghoulish, and more mobile, less gaunt, less skeletal and sickly.

**HE SAYS PALPATINE'S LINE**

""Fulfill... your... Destiny.""

I mean... Palpatine learned from the best, and what better way to showcase Plagueis's influence than to show that he uses similar methods of conversion.

**THEY'VE BEEN CRPYTIC ABOUT SNOKE'S IDENTITY**

If Snoke's identity was some new rando dude introduced into this new storyline, we would have seen what he looked like before the movie was released.

**BORROWING FROM THE EU WITHOUT USING IT**

**Snoke looks like a Muun.**


**Book Cover**

This convinced me when I was watching the movie that Snoke was Plagueis, since Plagueis theory came out after TFA.

**Early Concept Art**

http://thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Supreme-Leader-Snoke-Blurry-Picture.jpg

Early concept of Snoke looks a lot like Darth Plagueis.

http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/0/05/Darthplagueis-cover.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110713215940

http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/star-wars-snoke-slice-600x200.jpg

Same aesthetic... Apprentice meets a gigantic version of the master in a misty, foggy room. This aesthetic only shares overlap with Plagueis and Snoke.

**PHYSICALLY SIMILAR**

Muun is not canon, thrown out. Yet, Snoke is pretty Muun-like. If Snoke was a Muun, it would be retardedly obvious. And... Muuns look kind of dumb, to be honest. I'd throw out him being a Muun too, but keep some similarities to tease people.

**HE ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE PALPATINE MURDERED THE SHIT OUT OF HIM**

I mean, come on. Lightsaber to the dome, force lighting to the face in a sneak attack. And, he had to sneak attack him. Palpatine knew he couldn't defeat him head on, so he had to sneak up on him. Which means he's more powerful than Palpatine, at least when Palpatine killed him. Now that we can see that Snoke can regenerate himself, this resolves the loose end where it seems like he can't regenerate himself anymore.

Fits about his power level in The Force Awakens: absolutely terrifying, holding Rey in place with the force, torturing her, even though she can best Kylo, and probably has training at the point in the scene.

**ELEGANCE OF THE STORY**

All six George Lucas Star Wars movies were written such that characters, themes and plots all tie into one another.

It's clear that this is what's happening already. Kylo is talking to Vader's Helmet. Rey grew up on a desert planet, stabs like Palpatine and overhead thrusts like Anakin and shares his aggression and recklessness.

Kylo is the grandson of Vader. Luke is taking on the role of Yoda in some sense. All these old characters are littered all over the place: they're weaving an intricate web, not just making up some new random direction for the story.

**RESPONSES TO COMMON POINTS**

**THERE ARE NO SITH IN THE FORCE AWAKENS**

And Darth Plagueis renounced the Sith after the pattern of the rule of two eventually got the better of him.

**HE'S NOT A MUUN**

Well he's not supposed to be anymore, and Muuns look stupid. Who wants *that* to be the master of Emperor Palpatine in the biggest franchise of all time? That's some video game level character design right there, making him into a Muun...

**HE'S AN ANCIENT BEING FROM THE OUTER REGIONS**

Well, he doesn't have to be ancient, and Plagueis can be ancient. Plagueis could have hidden out in the outer regions and manipulated Palpatine into sending him the tools to build The First Order.

**IT'S SILLY TO HAVE A CHARACTER REINCARNATE/REGENERATE**

Well guess what, it's already clear that Snoke can restore his life force.

**PABLO TWEET**

I mean, it just looks bad if Pablo keeps beating around the bush. We got too close, so he shut down communication on the topic. People say that he's clear on storyline points, but honestly, the stakes are MUCH bigger than some T.V. show - BILLIONS of dollars are at stake here. Take main storyline ""spoilers"" or lackthereof as if they were never written.

**J.J. DENIAL**

KHAAAAAAN! And it was at the panel I was using as evidence of deflection/lying.

**CLOSING**

I'm just well onboard for Snoke=Plagueis at this point. It's ridiculously apparent. It's going to be bizarre if he isn't Plagueis at this point. Snoke is Plagueis. I'm as convinced of this as I was that R+L=J in Game of Thrones, and as I was about Jon Snow's fate. In fact, I'm more convinced of this than I was about either of those Game of Thrones theories.

Snoke is Darth Plagueis. I'm now confident.",starwarsspeculation,165,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/763c6n/theres_like_a_99_chance_that_snoke_is_plagueis/,THEORY,Xallios,763c6n,/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/763c6n/theres_like_a_99_chance_that_snoke_is_plagueis/,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/763c6n/theres_like_a_99_chance_that_snoke_is_plagueis/,240,2017-10-13
"Rey appears to be retrieving something from the water in the new TLJ trailer, and how it might connect to the first teaser trailer.","So a few things I've put together here, first without (potential) spoilers and then jumping into speculation.  At [1:50] (https://youtu.be/Q0CbN8sfihY?t=110) in the new trailer we see Rey diving into some murky water.  I believe she does so purposefully given how she swims after the dive, leading me to believe she wasn't pushed or thrown in, but she jumped in by her own volition.  Also important to note here is that it's dark out, so if she did jump in by her own accord, she's probably doing it at a time when hopefully no one (Luke) would notice.  Now immediately afterwards we get a shot of her coming out of the water, but what's interesting here is notice how she appears to try and pull herself up just using one hand, her right.  Generally you would use two, especially for someone who has little to no experience swimming and would be scrambling to get out of the water had she been thrown in.  I believe this is because she's holding something in her left hand.  In the scene immediately following after, when she stands up to face a scowling Luke in the rain, we ONLY see her right hand, her left is completely blocked by her body.  I also believe this is purposeful, so the audience can't see what she's holding.  


Up to this point I think this is all pretty straightforward, but that leads me to speculate on the what/why/where of all of this.  


This is where I think the poster of Luke's X-Wing being submerged under the water of Ahch-To can give us a clue, seen [here] (https://milnersblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/star-wars-the-last-jedi-new-promo-posters-ultra-hi-resolution-luke-and-rey.jpg) .  I think there was a very specific reason these images were included in promotional materials, and I think it provides the perfect setting for Rey's underwater ""scavenger"" hunt.  I believe she went to retrieve something from Luke's X-Wing, something important that has yet to be revealed and (most likely) Luke doesn't want her finding.  Now why Luke doesn't want her finding it (why she jumped in at night and got caught red handed), I have no idea.  But *spoilers* I'm going to speculate on what I believe it actually is.


I believe what she went to retrieve was Luke's compass.  If you remember back in May a Making Star Wars post titled The gear of Luke Skywalker in Star Wars: The Last Jedi went into detail about an ornate compass Luke Skywalker possesses (article found [here] (https://makingstarwars.net/2017/05/the-gear-of-luke-skywalker-in-star-wars-the-last-jedi/) ).  So ornate in fact Making Star Wars speculated it had to have a major role.  Given that they were right about every other piece of equipment Luke has (e.g. his snake staff, sack, etc.) I believe this to be an actual leak of something we haven't been shown yet.  If that's the case I think the compass would be perfect both literally and figuratively as an object Luke has ""lost"" that Rey brings back, as we've all already speculated she helps him gain his bearings so to speak and jump back into the fight.  I think it makes too much sense to further the story, in addition to being about the right size for her to grab with a single hand and pull back up to the surface.  But now going back to the title of this crazy long post, how does this connect with the first teaser?


Because I believe the Jedi Symbol we see in the first teaser trailer, the symbol of the Jedi Order, is based on a compass itself.  Now many people have speculated that it's no coincidence that the poster with Rey holding the lightsaber looks very much like the symbol of the Jedi Order seen [here] (http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/04/14/tljposter-jedi-order-symbol-1492203125084_1280w.jpg) . And I believe that's true, I believe they're meant to resemble one another.  But if you look at this [still] (https://media0dk-a.akamaihd.net/78/20/84eb8c692938cb6c616581b5b4a0704a.jpg) from the teaser trailer of the ancient Jedi symbol, look at the circular marks around the central ""lightsaber"" part of the symbol and the faded lines that lead inward, *exactly like a compass*.  Therefore the lightsaber ""star"" isn't just representative of the light coming off of the saber, but the North/South/East/West 8 sided star symbol of a compass.  Just google a compass, the symbol is basically identical except for making it a bit more lightsabery.  


What this means is that the lightsaber is both *figuratively* *and* *literally* pointing them in the right direction, the will of the force, whatever you want to call it.  And to top it off, most compasses used a jewel bearing intended to increase accuracy, which is an easy mechanism to replace with a kyber crystal to channel the force.  


So I know I definitely went nuts off the deep end here but I honestly think the pieces fit together too well for this not to be the case.  The revelation the symbol of the Jedi Order is a compass has lead me to endless speculation, and story wise Luke using it to find Ahch-To, presumably losing it in a crash, and Rey finding it to point Luke in the right direction sounds like poetry to me.  What do you guys think?


TL;DR: *SPOILERS* Rey jumps into the water to find Luke's Jedi compass, the symbol of the Jedi Order in the books on Ahch-To is / is based on a compass.

Kylo's hand and his humanity. Luke's hand rising from the ashes of the Empire.,"Back in February of 2017, [I wrote a theory detailing how Luke and Rey’s hands were used as symbols to represent humanity, “more machine than man,” and a couple of other things.](https://swshadowcouncil.wordpress.com/2017/10/09/the-force-awakens-symbolism-duality-of-hands/) I updated it before the new trailer came out. I recommend reading this before continuing.

In the recent trailer for The Last Jedi, two key moments popped up that tie in with my analysis. First and foremost is the moment that Kylo Ren holds his hand out for Rey, and the moment of Luke’s hand bursting from the ashes of his fallen Jedi academy.

### Kylo Ren is Human!

In my theory, I show that ‘holding your hand out’ is a sign of compassion and humanity. We’ve seen this sort of thing not only in other Star Wars movies, but also in other trailers as well. [Remember this from the second teaser?](https://imgur.com/FTdeDEV) Refer back to my original theory for more info, but essentially this came as a sign of compassion after distrusting Finn for a short while and telling him to stop taking her hand. And we now see a similar shot in the new teaser with Kylo Ren. This is especially noteworthy because, the sequence with Rey and Finn in TFA showcases Rey’s distrust of accepting help from anyone else, because of her insecurities and distrust bred from…well, growing up on Jakku without a family. She only felt comfortable giving out help to Finn, not receiving it, because she had built a prison in her mind (a prison she said awoke in the teaser?)

So for her to possibly accept help from the one she least expected is big! Well, as Luke said: “This is not going to go the way you think.”

Kylo Ren is becoming human again, just as Adam Driver promised us.

### Luke rising from the ashes of the Empire.

Referring back to my original theory, Luke’s artificial hand represents the scars. The act of disarming someone is a foil to holding your hand out for someone. The former is the dark side, the latter is the light side. Remember, Luke almost did the former in ROTJ, and it led him to realize the path he was going down.

In the trailer for The Last Jedi, we see Luke’s artificial hand rise from the ashes of his fallen temple, destroyed at the hands of his nephew. Kylo Ren is motivated to be as powerful as his grandfather, Darth Vader, who gave Luke that hand on Bespin. It serves as a reminder for what Luke and his father went through. It serves as the one part of Luke that is ‘more machine than man.

And now, the hand has withered away and shows itself again. The scars of the Empire have returned. His hand literally rises from the ashes of what Snoke and the FO have done to him. This idea is made even better if his synthetic skin was burned away in the fire. The ‘more machine than man’ part of him now shows itself again, a remnant from the Empire…

Because, as The Force Awakens opening crawl said: “The sinister First Order has risen from the ashes of the Empire.” And they are determined to wipe out the last Jedi.

Thanks for reading.

the TFA lie; TLJ connection,"If this has been posted here, im sorry. But here's something i've been thinking: the force awakens is clearly a mirror of the new hope. That's pretty much acknowledged by the sw community.

Having this in mind, we can also try to connect some characters, in terms of their role in the story, right? Let's say.. rey plays more or less the same hero role luke plays in ep4. And kylo plays the villain role that vader played. So, we can hypothesize that han played the same role as ben did. He guided rey and connected with her in the same mentor-mentored way as luke did with ben.

My question then follows: where is the lie?

episode 4 had a pretty big one. ""vader betrayed and murdered your father"". Where's the lie in TFA? Rey's parentage is not mentioned. Her origins neither. There is only one moment, that a ben-like character tells rey something stated as a fact, but that we cannot prove.

""He was training a new generation of jedi but one boy, an apprentice, turned against him and destroyed it all""

Yes. We immediately think: sure, kylo did it. And yes, i agree. Kylo did kill the jedi. That's why he is the ""jedi killer"". Tough dude, respect. 

Anyway, if you actually think about what han said, you realize he did not mention the ""killing of the jedi"". He said a boy destroyed it all. 

Well. I think han-boy was lying. It wasn't a boy who burnt down the temple. No sir. That was Rey. And Han knew it. That is why it makes sense she was dropped off in Jaku. As Luke was afraid he could not control her. Look at the last trailer. Look at his face. I don't think he wanted to hide her because he was afraid what people could do to her. 

He seems to be clearly afraid.. of what Rey can do to people.",StarWarsTheories,15,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/761bzr/the_tfa_lie_tlj_connection/,,sanok548,761bzr,/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/761bzr/the_tfa_lie_tlj_connection/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsTheories/comments/761bzr/the_tfa_lie_tlj_connection/,8,2017-10-13
A theory on Rey getting a purple lightsaber,"~~1- The toy from Target: https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/52159412_Alt06?wid=520&amp;hei=520&amp;fmt=pjpeg and http://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/04/13/lightsaber-in-package-1492058215609.jpg Now I take this leak a bit more seriously than I’ve seen some people. However a purple lightsaber isn’t exactly common in Star Wars (especially not in the films), so it seems odd that if they were just giving it a random color, that they would go with purple and not something like blue, green, or even red.~~ edit: this is pretty much debunked and was just a coincidence/bad research on my end, sorry!

2- Purple lightsaber users have commonly dabbled on both the light and dark side of the force. Now this is usually a Sith turning to a Jedi, but a Jedi turning Sith isn’t exactly out of the question. A big question going into The Last Jedi is what side of the Force Rey will land on. Being somewhere in the middle would be an new and interesting direction and would also make sense with her allying with Kylo. 

3- Purple lightsaber wielders have typically been extremely powerful fighters and/or Force users. Rey is obviously being set up to be someone that fits right into that category.

4- From the trailer it seems Rey wields Luke’s blue lightsaber that was given to him by Obi Wan. That lightsaber was made with a kyber crystal. Kyber crystals are attuned with the Force and are colorless until they are united with a Force-sensitive user. They are described as being almost sentient and have been theorized to link with their users emotional shifts. So is it possible for Rey to dip into both the Light and Dark side of the force and the kyber crystal to react accordingly, changing the lightsaber to a purple color? (edit: also I think it’s noteworthy that Kylo also has a kyber crystal lightsaber)

5- Since the expanded universe isn’t canon anymore. It’s easily possible that the writers will pull elements from it to use in their story in characters. This brings me to Mara Jade Skywalker. Rey has a decently similar character and personality to her, with her story of being on her own and a scavenger being the same. Guess what color lightsaber Mara used? That’s right purple (well magenta, but for this argument same thing). It was given to her by Emperor Palpatine when she became the Emperor’s Hand. So the theory would go that Snoke would gift Rey a purple lightsaber after she becomes his Hand?

Overall I think the odds of Rey having a purple lightsaber are high, but I’m not 100% sure on the reason. This is the best theory I’ve come up with yet but I would love to hear what you guys think about the idea in general.

Lukes a different person. Does this bother you?,"So, Luke appears to be a shadow of his former self in what weve seen in the newest trailer. He seems scared, maybe kind of hopeless. A lot different then when we last saw him in ROTJ. 

Ive seen a lot of peoplebreally down or even angry about this particular thing. But, why? People grow and people change. Me personally I dont have a big issue with this. And ive also been told im not a True SW fan because of this. Why? 

Like, what uf the PT came first and we knew Anakin as a kid and saw this kid grow up intona good hearted and extremely powerful jedi. Then we get to ROTS and we see him literally become Darth Vader. Would that have changed anyones fandom.or love for the trilogy or Star Wars then? 

Why is it such an issue to see Luke in a differentbposition. I dont think hes a villain or dark side in secret but i feel that he hes been through 30 years if loss and tragedy. Epiphanies and belief changes. So its actually a natural progression for one to have those changes and for the character to overcome and grow. its part of the development. 

Ill leave it there for now so maybe we can discuss it maybe.

"The Last Jedi epic showdown: Attack of the Clones, Return of the Jedi and Tron: Legacy Influences","
When Kylo Ren is looking at his helmet right before smashing it, he looks like he is in a large Turbolift or Anteroom of some kind. Maybe that is right before he enters Snokes throne room, attacking the Praetorian Guards (not for training). He made a choice and is taking on Snoke and his guards! He smashed the helmet which represents what Snoke wants him to be, not who he is. 

There will be no Kylo training with the Guards scene. In fact this scene will mirror Attack of the Clones end lightsaber battle in three stages: 


Stage 1: Rey is brought before Snoke by Kylo Ren like Vader brought Luke before the Emperor. Then she rushes his guards attacking them like Anakin attacked Dooku in AOTC despite Obi Wans warning. Rey is frozen in midair by Snoke. Kylo Ren is sent away. This is not going as he expected. He smashes his helmet and decides to return. 

Stage 2: Kylo/Ben returns and attacks the guards betraying Snoke. (Akin to Vader rescuing Luke in ROTJ to Anakin vs. Dooku in AOTC after Obi Wan is out of action) Ben dispatches the guards with ease and skill but fails to get to Snoke himself. He has to break off the attack or else Snoke will kill Rey. Kylo hesitates thus. 

Stage 3: Enter the Grandmaster, Luke Skywalker as we finally wanted to see him appears out of the shadows. We see fear creeping into Snokes face as he releases Rey who is caught by Kylo. Luke tells him to get her away as the battle of the Grandmasters begins unlike anything we have ever seen before. Like Yoda surprising us, Luke will be THE Master forcing Snoke to flee, showing us why he feared Luke. (cue TRON Legacy when ""the Maker"" returns in an epic fashion to save the heroes. 

Maybe they splice in some ANH with Luke going out Kenobi style to ensure their save getaway? Maybe not. That leaves only Ben able to guide Rey on her path. Or a TESB style reveal and a bottomless pit somebody can fall into to escape?

Kylo Ren's allegiences in The Last Jedi,"So there's the theory that Kylo Ren is a double agent for the resistance seeking to destroy the First Order from within. That's quite old, and it claims that he kills Han in order to gain Snoke's trust. I think there's new evidence for this theory from the new trailer.

To start with, I think that Kylo is learning the ways of the dark side because he believes it to be the only way to destroy another dark side force user like Snoke. He also thinks himself to be strong enough to use the dark side without being lost to it forever. I think that it was Kylo's idea, but Luke disagreed, believing him to be incapable of such a mission. Luke now thinks Kylo has been lost to the darkness.

In the new trailer, there are two scenes I think which support this. First is the scene where Luke is on the ground in the rain saying ""This is not going to go the way you think"". This is where Luke fights Kylo, but lets himself be beaten, because he hopes Kylo is still on his side. The other scene is the last moment in the trailer, where Kylo extends his hand to who I think is Luke. During their earlier fight, Snoke captures Rey. Kylo and Luke can't stop him right then, so Kylo goes back for Luke later, and they both go to rescue Rey.

The other thing is, Kylo has to either turn good or be revealed as good all along this movie, because Rey is too powerful. A character with her level of power has to either be evil or be killed, otherwise it makes the story too bland. I think either Snoke kills her or turns her to the dark side in the torture scene. Assuming that, then the only light side force user left would be Luke unless Kylo was as well. 

tl;dr, Kylo is a double-agent learning the dark side from Snoke in order to kill him, Luke doesn't think he is able to do so, Kylo and Luke team up at the end. Rey is either killed or turns evil.",FanTheories,4,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/762nh8/kylo_rens_allegiences_in_the_last_jedi/,FanSpeculation,inthewreckagebrother,762nh8,/r/FanTheories/comments/762nh8/kylo_rens_allegiences_in_the_last_jedi/,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/762nh8/kylo_rens_allegiences_in_the_last_jedi/,4,2017-10-13
Last Jedi Plot Theory - Force absorption (Tutaminis),"I believe that a central theme of the Last Jedi will be force absorption or force transference. And a related theme may be that proximity to another force wielder can have a positive or negative effect on the other.

I think Luke may believe that he unwittingly enhanced/influenced Ben Solo's dark side power and that is why he is reluctant to train Rey. The vision he saw in the cave of himself in Vader's suit and Palpatine's attempt to recruit him to the dark side caused him to suspect that there may be some darkness that resides within him. Remember...Luke appeared to be at his best when he was around Obi Wan and Yoda, but showed evil intent when around Vader and Palatine.

I think that Snoke has new force powers that he has taught Kylo Ren (stopping laser bolts, paralyzing Rey, deep memory searching, etc.) and one of the most vital power is the ability to absorb force from others (Tutaminis). In fact, Ben Solo may have discovered this power during the time when Luke was rebuilding the Jedi Order. He may have tried absorbing force power from others because he was not elite trainee despite his lineage. The outcome could have been the destruction of the Jedi temple and may also have alerted Snoke to his existance when the act rippled through 'The Force'.

Opposite of Luke's encounter with Vader and Palpatine, Kylo Ren was weaker around Rey because of her 'goodness', but she also had a flicker of evil during their battle. For a moment, he could have been feeling benevolent (the light side) when he said, ""You need a teacher. I can show you the ways of the Force."" 

In the Last Jedi, I think Leia will transfer some of her force power to her son or let him absorb her force power in hopes that it will bring him back to the light side. As a result, she will become 'one with the force'. A good send off for Carrie Fisher.

It has been rumored that Snoke is regenerating in some way, perhaps by absorbing force power. Maybe the Knights of Ren are now the Pretorian guards from who he can draw force power to regenerate.

All of this speculation can align Obi Wan and Yoda's description of 'The Force'. 

""The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together."" - Obi Wan

"[H] Games on Demand (PUBG, Divinity OS 2), Cuphead, Mass Effect Andromeda, Hollow Knight, DeadCells, Rocket League, Owlboy, Total War: Warhammer, XCOM 2, Wolfenstein Games, Left 4 Dead 2, Rogue Legacy, Castle Crashers, Metro Redux Bundle, Over 900 Games/Software/DLC [W] Any Humble Gift Link Offers","----  
**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Furi, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

The Skywalkers are the force incarnate and are key to the balance of the force... hear me out,"I'm a firm believer in the Snoke/Plageius theories that are floating around and here's my take... The Galaxy has been battling non stop back and forth between dark and light, there was a prophecy about the one, Anakin ""fulfilled"" it, now I'm going off blind faith regarding the prophecy and believing it to be correct. Lucas has always said that it's a family story and the family is obviously the Skywalkers...

Where did the Skywalkers originate?  We know Anakin was the original Skywalker and I firmly believe that Anakin was a virgin birth of the force and as suggested in Episode 3, Plageius (Snoke) ""created"" Anakin and Sideous trained his (or Snoke's) creation. This would explain Kylo's obsessive Vader following and loyalty to his great grandad, Snoke. The Skywalker lineage are force incarnate and they are the key to balance. 

Now the question is WHY was Rey dropped off on Jakku? Just like Anakin (presumably hiding from jedi until being discovered at the right time then being swept up by Palpatine) and Luke (hiding from Vader/the Empire), Rey was forced to hide. Rey MUST be Skywalker bloodline for my theory to make sense, the most logical guess is she's Kylo's brother and Luke (similar to Yoda seeing raw power in Luke reminding him of Anakin) sees raw power in Rey, reminding him of what he saw in Kylo and is afraid to train her. 

Now heres a far off theory... I'm going off the deep end and saying Rey has a similar path as Anakin and maybe Snoke created her if she is not a Skywalker. Maybe that's why she's asking where she fits in all this? 

Fact: Luke and Leia will be killed and Rey will be the last Jedi.

EDIT: Why are all the baddies (Palpatine and Vader now Snoke) telling these Skywalkers to fulfill destinies, WHAT is their destiny? They were created for the dark side under Snoke/Plageius.

Last Jedi Plot Theory - Force absorption (Tutaminis),"I believe that a central theme of the Last Jedi will be force absorption or force transference. And a related theme may be that proximity to another force wielder can have a positive or negative effect on the other.

I think Luke may believe that he unwittingly enhanced/influenced Ben Solo's dark side power and that is why he is reluctant to train Rey. The vision he saw in the cave of himself in Vader's suit and Palpatine's attempt to recruit him to the dark side caused him to suspect that there may be some darkness that resides within him. Remember...Luke appeared to be at his best when he was around Obi Wan and Yoda, but showed evil intent when around Vader and Palatine.

I think that Snoke has new force powers that he has taught Kylo Ren (stopping laser bolts, paralyzing Rey, deep memory searching, etc.) and one of the most vital power is the ability to absorb force from others (Tutaminis). In fact, Ben Solo may have discovered this power during the time when Luke was rebuilding the Jedi Order. He may have tried absorbing force power from others because he was not elite trainee despite his lineage. The outcome could have been the destruction of the Jedi temple and may also have alerted Snoke to his existance when the act rippled through 'The Force'.

Opposite of Luke's encounter with Vader and Palpatine, Kylo Ren was weaker around Rey because of her 'goodness', but she also had a flicker of evil during their battle. For a moment, he could have been feeling benevolent (the light side) when he said, ""You need a teacher. I can show you the ways of the Force."" 

In the Last Jedi, I think Leia will transfer some of her force power to her son or let him absorb her force power in hopes that it will bring him back to the light side. As a result, she will become 'one with the force'. A good send off for Carrie Fisher.

It has been rumored that Snoke is regenerating in some way, perhaps by absorbing force power. Maybe the Knights of Ren are now the Pretorian guards from who he can draw force power to regenerate.

All of this speculation can align Obi Wan and Yoda's description of 'The Force'. 

""The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together."" - Obi Wan

“Life creates it, makes it grow. It’s energy surrounds us and binds us....You must feel the Force around you.

**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Furi, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

"[H] Games on Demand (PUBG, Divinity OS 2), Cuphead, Mass Effect Andromeda, Hollow Knight, DeadCells, Rocket League, Owlboy, Total War: Warhammer, XCOM 2, Wolfenstein Games, Left 4 Dead 2, Rogue Legacy, Castle Crashers, Metro Redux Bundle, Over 900 Games/Software/DLC [W] Any Humble Gift Link Offers","----  
**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Furi, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

"I'm a professor who has published books on Star Wars and Blade Runner, AMA","...and with both Blade Runner 2049 and The Last Jedi trailer out this week, I thought now might be a good time to talk to Reddit.

Ask me anything about Blade Runner, Star Wars and the other stuff I've written about (retro video games, Batman and superheroes, Alice in Wonderland, David Bowie) ... or about academia, PhDs, becoming a professor, getting that kind of book published.

Here's some more about me and my background: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Brooker

Proof, fresh from my office at work: https://imgur.com/a/NVWzt


---------
EDIT: I've now been answering questions for 3 and a half hours solid, and have 150 still to answer... I'll keep going as long as I can. Thanks for all the discussion so far!

--------

EVERYBODY HATES EDITS: I've been answering questions for 5 hours 15 minutes now and my hands are really taking the strain. I'll come back tomorrow, around 8am GMT, and give it another shot. 

I appreciate all the questions, especially the ones asking if I'm 'professor of edge', or in Chemical Romance, or Green Day, or if I'm Draco Malfoy or a scary street magician.


-------

**EDIT 3** I've now put in 2 and a half more hours on a Sunday and I'm afraid I have to prepare my teaching for Monday, or my students won't have a good time.

Just watched The Force Awakens and Rogue One for the first time ever. Impressions.,"As you can guess by the title, I'm not really the biggest star wars fan, despite having seen the OT a few times (I mean who hasn't) and enjoying them. And with all the The Last Jedi hype over the last few days, I thought it was finally time to jump in and see what I've missed.

1) The Force Awakens

I can't imagine what the expectations for this was back at release, but my expectations were pretty much that I knew people liked it more than the prequels, other than that I was going in almost completely blind. I do have to admit, Han Solo's fate was already spoiled for me all the way back at release, as it seemed every comment section on the internet was unsafe from this spoiler, even ones completely unrelated to Star Wars, but it didn't ruin the experience for me. 

So, here goes nothing, I really enjoyed this movie.

One thing I didn't want was for them to rely too much on the older classic characters, and they didn't. I mean, they're there and their influence is felt, but the new characters are allowed to carry the movie. And like their original counterparts, there's a likability and charisma to them.

Finn - I want to be this guy's friend, he's bumbling and does some stupid stuff, but his bravery and charm cannot be denied. His loyalty to Rey is sweet and I hope she doesn't continue to friendzone him, lol.

Poe - Doesn't get much screen time unfortunately, but the short time he was there he made a good impact.

Han - Harrison didn't feel like he phoned it in and I'm glad. He was Han Solo, just as charming here as in the OT, his death was very well done as well imo.

Leia - Meh, weakest performance in the movie imo, didn't do anything for me. Maybe it's because Leia's so different from how she was in the OT, compared to Han who feels very similar. Hopefully Carrie's great in her final performance in The Last Jedi.

BB8 - I want one.

Rey - Pretty much the MVP of the movie, she probably made a slightly bigger impact on me in her first movie than Luke in A New Hope surprisingly, we'll see if it stays that way by the end of the trilogy. Strong and technically gifted, yet wide eyed and emotionally vulnerable, perfect kind of protagonist for young people that haven't experienced star wars before. I don't really know if there's anything that interesting they can do with her character tho, she's pretty much destined to follow the same arc as Luke did.

And lastly, Kylo Ren, if there's one character I'm very interested to see where they go with, it's this guy. At first I was like ""Okay he's a pretty good Vader knock off, he sounds cool, looks cool, has a cool lightsaber etc"" Well, turns out the reason I thought that was because he's a total fanboy lmao. He's a conflicted, insecure fanboy that throws temper-tantrums, and it's glorious. The fact that Rey already beat him however (despite being shot) makes me think he won't be the main bad guy in the end, because why would the give that moment away in the first movie of the trilogy otherwise?

My criticisms however are the fact that the movie plays it a little too safe on some of the plot elements. Hey, here's a Death Star, but this time it can destroy FIVE planets at once.
Hey, here's the empire, but they're even more OP now? I thought the Rebels won the last time?
Speaking of the Rebels, why are they still the underdogs? Did I miss something?
And like I said, Rey, although she's fantastic and a very charismatic hero, is pretty much just gonna be female Luke right?

But, despite the reuse of things from the OT, I can see why they did it after the mostly terrible reception of the prequels, and it didn't ruin the movie because I still very much enjoyed learning about these new characters and watching them interact, and at the end of the day, that's the most important part of storytelling to me, characterization. Still hope to see a couple of new twists in TLJ however.


2) Rogue One

So after thoroughly enjoying TFA, I had the Star wars itch back, so the next day I jumped into this. I knew nothing going into this one, no impressions, no trailers, no nothing except for the fact I know it was a New Hope prequel.

So remember when I just said in my TFA section that having characters I care about is the most important part of storytelling for me? Maybe that's why the first 2/3rds of this movie really didn't do much for me. So you have a plot where I pretty much know exactly how it's gonna end up, your only option at that point is to make me care through your characters, and I didn't. 

I can tell it's supposed to be a darker film and everything, but god everyone's so dull. When the robot is the one with the most personality, there's a problem. As things stand, Jyn the only one of the main group I can remember the name of, and that's just because she's the main character, because she was just kinda there aswell.

The movie really wanted me to care about her relationship with her dad, and I just couldn't, I feel like I needed an extra scene or two with her as a child. Like for example, one of my favorite games of all time The Last of Us has a very cute, funny scene with the main character and his daughter at the start, and I felt instantly attached to their relationship. That was missing here.

I also feel like there were too many characters. The first 30mins of the movie jumps all over the place trying to introduce so many characters at once, sometimes less is more and I definitely think that should be the case here.

So if the first 2/3rds of the movie were mostly sleep inducing for me, thank god they ramp up the action and big ass explosions in the final 3rd. Because despite me being a character first kinda guy, I do love me some big ass action scenes, and this definitely delivered on that front. Of course, it would of been better had I really cared for the safety and well being of our heroes, but it's still a very well done sequence nevertheless. If there's one thing you can't knock the film for, it's the way it looks.

The best part of the movie however was watching the one character I actually do care about, Darth fucking Vader absolutely crush those poor fuckers in the hallway, even the most basic star wars fan had to mark out for that one haha. On a less positive note, CGI Leia and Empire commander guy (I forgot his name) was a little jarring to say the least.

So yeah pretty meh movie overall in my opinion, if not for the final act it would've been Phantom Menace territory for me.",StarWars,81,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/76f4ui/just_watched_the_force_awakens_and_rogue_one_for/,,LukeParkes,76f4ui,/r/StarWars/comments/76f4ui/just_watched_the_force_awakens_and_rogue_one_for/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/76f4ui/just_watched_the_force_awakens_and_rogue_one_for/,82,2017-10-14

PSA: TV Spots are where the spoiler dial gets turned up to 11,"We just got our first TV spot, and we're likely to get many more in the next two months. As such, it's important to remember that TV spots are not made in the same way, or for the same audiences, as normal trailers.

The main trailers, especially the stellar trailers we've been getting for the recent Star Wars movies, are hyper-meticulous in the way they feed you the right amount of information to get hyped without giving the whole story away or making you feel like you've seen everything. TV Spots are much looser, by design. They're made for the casual fan, or even the non-fan, who may or may not want to see the movie in theaters but could be swayed if a TV spot shows them enough cool and interesting imagery. 

Here's what always happens, at least to me, when TV spots come out; I see too much. I see new scenes that I shouldn't have seen, I see extended moments from previously seen sequences that give away more than they should. If you're a film-literate Star Wars nerd, this is really dangerous, **because the more of these extra bits you see**, as small as they may seem individually, **the more you will be able to mentally patch together the jigsaw puzzle and before you know it, there's little discovery or surprise left in the final film**.

I'm not saying the TV spots are going to give away a massive plot twist or anything. I'm saying that if you want to truly *discover* The Last Jedi, it's in your best interest to stay away from the TV spots. Let the trailers tide you over.

Cory in the House for the Nintendo DS review,"Unlike its predecessor, Cory in the House doesn't exactly come screaming off the starting line. Compared to That's So Raven, where you're immediately plunged headlong into a sexy story of intrigue and betrayal, this main quest can seem mundane, even perfunctory at times. But each time I stepped off the well-beaten path to blaze my own trail, it turned into a wild, open, exhilarating fantasy roleplaying experience, rife with opportunities to make use of its excellent combat. Even after over 100 hours with Cory in the House, it still tempts me to press on – there’s so much more I want to learn, and hunt.

Cory in the House is as dense and deep as the other Disney games in terms of RPG mechanics, and the overwhelmingly massive open-world environment has at once made that depth more intimidating, and in the long run, more rewarding. It’s difficult to express just how huge and open this world is: verdant, rolling fields liberally dotted with swaying foliage of every shape and size fill the space between loosely connected, ramshackle townships where people struggle to scrape by. A full day/night cycle and dynamic weather pull it all together, cementing Cory in the House's landscape as one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds I’ve ever seen. A handy minimap points you where you want to go, which might seem like a crutch, but honestly, without it, I’d have been hopelessly lost. That a world this size still feels so purposeful, and full of things to do is quite an achievement.

The one caveat on all that though, is the technical performance on both the Xbox One and PS4 versions. 30 frames per second was sometimes too much to ask, transitions between Cory in the House's two main maps are just a bit too long, and minor glitches do pop up from time to time. None of it ever impacted gameplay in any meaningful way, though it did compromise the beauty of the experience ever so slightly. Thankfully, PC players can expect a lot more. On a GTX 980, Cory in the House ran at 60 frames per second at all times on ultra settings. 

This new open-world map obviously has ramifications for the structure of the story, and though there are flashes of greatness, the main story is ultimately the least fulfilling part of Cory in the House. You might call it another case of The Elder Scrolls Syndrome. Our tale begins as a multi-continent search for Cory's long-lost lover Maiara, and Sophie, his surrogate daughter. My single biggest issue though, is that it never becomes much more: the overly long main story is essentially just Cory running errands for people in exchange for information on Sophie's whereabouts. It effectively maintains focus and momentum, but it feels more like a wild goose chase than an intriguing mystery to unravel, like the one we got in The Suite Life of Zack and Cody.

Thanks to lots of excellent dialogue and voice acting there is some emotional payoff along the way, but it’s mixed in with too much padding in the form of meaningless fetch quests and collectathons. Every time I felt like I was on the verge of an interesting revelation, I’d have to suddenly stop to escort a goat, or search for a lost, narcoleptic dwarf. Heck, even Cory can barely hide his frustration with the constant parade of menial tasks at times.

It’s also worth noting that though you will get along fine without playing the first two games in the series, without the context provided by the Disney show, Sophie is more or less a complete stranger until the last quarter of the journey, which made it difficult to care about finding her as much as Cory in the House expected me to – especially given the slew of intriguing characters who are relegated to supportive background roles.

Thankfully, they all get chances to shine once you venture off the beaten path, and that’s where Cory in the House gets nearly everything incredibly right. Depending on your decisions in That's So Raven (which can be handily recreated via some dialogue early in the game), you’ll see lots of familiar faces returning to play a role in Cory's search, and once they have, they offer you a secondary line of quests that typically provide far more interesting scenarios to dabble in. Underground turf wars, assassination plots, love triangles, and unexpected alliances are all part of these optional romps. They’re all so meaty and full of rich story content that they feel like they should have been part of the main story.

The same can be said for a lot of the side quests you pick up in the field as well. Aside from the bevy of standard side-quests, monster lairs, and bandit camps generously littered about Cory in the House’s gargantuan land mass, you also get a bunch of monster-hunting Newt contracts to persue. Cory's quarry ranges from ethereal wraiths that need to be made tangible before you can harm them, to Foglets who conceal themselves in thick smog, waiting for a chance to strike. The payoff here is twofold: in keeping with the lore, these represent your most reliable stream of income, which is refreshingly significant due to an appropriately stingy in-game economy.

The other upside is that, more often than not, these hunts and other side activities provide interesting insights into a land being destroyed by war, and the many forces that play a role in shaping it. Best of all, you’re one of those forces. It may not shift the main story’s conclusion in monumental ways, but I often returned to places I’d visited earlier to find that a seemingly small decision played out in a very big way. There is no morality meter, no paragon or renegade rating. In the grayscale world of Cory in the House, there is only cause and effect; the decisions you make, both big and small, can legitimately change the world around you – far more so than most games that make similar claims.

Character progression and equipment choices are equally impactful. Relative to That's So Raven, I found that Cory in the House's RPG systems have been streamlined in some ways, and made more complex in others. In both cases though, the result is the same: a better experience. Simplifications to how you restock and use potions and oils makes them feel more practical and immediately useful, as you no longer need to meditate to do any of it. Sure, the old way was more in keeping with Cory lore, but in a wide open world, it makes less sense to expect players to predict and prepare for everything they might come across in advance. On the flip side, there’s a wider variety of powerful, interesting potions than ever, including those that greatly enhance mounted combat, and others that restore health as you cast spells (or Signs as Cory calls them).

Speaking of Signs, they’ve been improved across the board with alternate casting modes, and a wider variety of upgrades, making them impactful in every fight. It’s actually entirely viable to build a sign-focused Cory. I played him a lot like a Jedi actually, able to influence people’s minds in conversation, a powerful long range “force” push, and the ability to reflect crossbow bolts back to the sender (a returning ability that’s been made far more usable). The new skill system provides a good deal of flexibility while still rewarding players who want min/max for the best builds, and weapon and armor crafting is as deep and nuanced as ever, if not more so.

All of this shines through in Cory in the House's responsive, brutal real-time combat. Where combat in this series has up until this point felt vague and even a bit clunky, here it’s so fluid and satisfying that I walk around hoping for bandits to jump me just so I can repel their attacks with magical barriers, parry their blows with uncanny precision, and relieve them of life and/or limb with the occasional gory flourish. Disney has always done a great job of making me feel that I’ve outsmarted my foes, but for the first time here, controlling Cory feels tangibly badass with every successful fight.

The Verdict:
Though the straightforward and fetch-quest-heavy main story overstays its welcome, the option of joyfully adventuring through a rich, expansive open world was always there for me when I’d start to burn out. Even if the plot isn’t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate Cory in the House to a plane few other RPGs inhabit.",copypasta,22,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/76b942/cory_in_the_house_for_the_nintendo_ds_review/,,CloudStrife200,76b942,/r/copypasta/comments/76b942/cory_in_the_house_for_the_nintendo_ds_review/,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/76b942/cory_in_the_house_for_the_nintendo_ds_review/,3,2017-10-14
"The Legacy of the ""Skywalker"" Lightsaber","[The ""Skywalker"" Lightsaber](http://registry.rebelscum.com/reviews/luke_anakin_comparison_images/AllFourMain_small.jpg) is my favorite lightsaber in Star Wars. Besides the aesthetics of the hilt, I love how extensive the history of the blade is.

I recently started rewatching the Clone Wars and it got me thinking about how much the Lightsaber has been through:

**Clone Wars**:

* Too extensive to write, but the lightsaber saw use throughout the entirety of the war. 

**Revenge of the Sith**:

* Slaying of Count Dooku

* Indirect cause of Mace Windu's death

* Order 66, including the massacre of the younglings

* The Battle of Heroes on Mustafar

**Between Revenge of the Sith &amp; A New Hope**: 

* Not much is known, but the lightsaber at the very least in the possession of one of the last remaining Jedi Knights in the galaxy

**A New Hope**: 

* Passed down to the son of the lightsaber's original owner/builder

* Used in Luke's first steps into using the force (training droid on the Falcon)

**Between A New Hope &amp; Empire Strikes Back**: 

* The continuation of Luke's Jedi training

* A first confrontation (and near retrieval of the lightsaber) with Darth Vader

* Many more. This, much like the Clone Wars, is what really compelled me think about the extensive and impressive history of the blade

**Empire Strikes Back**: 

* Used in taking out an AT-AT

* Saving Luke's both by slaying the Wampa &amp; cutting open Han's tauntaun

* Training with Yoda

* Another confrontation with Darth Vader and it's subsequent loss in the depths of Cloud City

**Between Empire Strikes Back &amp; The Force Awakens**:

* A good question, for another time. But, at the very least, we can expect that the lightsaber changed hands and saw some sort of use during this time

**The Force Awakens**:

* Responsible for Rey's ""force vision"" and ""force awakening""

* Used to battle a Stormtrooper by Finn

* Used to fight Kylo Ren by Finn 

* Retrieved by Rey and used to defeat a wounded Kylo Ren in lightsaber combat

* Offered to Luke Skywalker by Rey

**The Last Jedi**:

* Returned to Luke Skywalker

* Used by Rey during her ""Jedi"" training.

I've glossed over a lot of the blade's history and that's what is so impressive. Outside of potentially C3PO and R2-D2 I'm not sure there's anything in Star Wars history that has been responsible or around the most influential and important moment in the galaxy's history. 

I love the idea of Rey building her own lightsaber, but I also love the idea of this lightsaber continuing to be an influential piece of galactic history.

Avengers infinity war trailer release theory,"With all the news about trailers lately and marvel confirming the infinity war trailer will be out by years end 
Everyone is hoping that it will be released with Thor ragnarak  but I think When Thor is released it will have a teaser/trailer for the Han solo movie and when The last Jedi is released it will have the avengers trailer since the comic con leaks kinda shows spoilers for the end of Thor 
And the fact there both Disney it would be a nice cross promotion for the two biggest movies of the year

"[H] Over 900 Games, Games on Demand (PUBG, Cuphead, Divinity OS 2) [W] Rise of the Tomb Raider, Overgrowth, TW Warhammer, XCOM 2, The Forest, Worms WMD, Armello, Pillars of Eternity, Payday 2, Ark, Crawl, Killing Floor 2, Space Engineers, Black Mesa, Inside, Any Other Humble gift Link Offers","----  
**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

"[H] Over 900 Games, Games on Demand (PUBG, Cuphead, Divinity OS 2) [W] Rise of the Tomb Raider, Overgrowth, TW Warhammer, XCOM 2, The Forest, Worms WMD, Armello, Pillars of Eternity, Payday 2, Ark, Crawl, Killing Floor 2, Space Engineers, Black Mesa, Inside, Any Other Humble gift Link Offers","----  
**PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE OFFERING:**    
  
----  
  

  
Below is a list of game keys and Steam gifts I have available to trade. They are grouped into 7 tiers, steam gifts, top, high, mid and low tier keys, vr games and software / dlcs. **The tiers don't necessarily reflect value so do not think the games in each tier are worth the same, it's just to separate them a little.**   
  
I am interested in humble gift links, steam gifts and gift cards. **I will consider anything of value, even games I already own or am offering myself.**   
  
**If you want a game on demand, such as a full priced new game, expect to need to offer 2 or 3 good bundle games per $10. Some past monthlies, such as ark, total war warhammer, xcom 2, have much higher value than this and I will value them more, but the majority will fall into this area.** I can get any game on demand, offer paypal, csgo keys, games on steam, humble, origin, etc., but it must be a good deal for me to want to do it. If you want other bundle games, then I can offer good trades, but if I am spending money on a non bundle game to trade, expect to overpay a bit.
  
Some example of titles I am interested in from past bundles include: Rise of the Tomb Raider, Worms WMD, Overcooked, Killing Floor2, Hyper Light Drifter, Armello, NBA 2K17, Pillars of Eternity, Total War Warhammer, XCOM 2, Crawl, Ark, Space Engineers, Prison Architect, Rocket League, Payday 2, Rust, Slime Rancher, Dragon's Dogma, Grim Dawn, Overgrowth, Hand of Fate, Mad Max, Wasteland 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, Hurtworld, Lovers in Dangerous Space Time, Dungeon Defenders, Telltale Batman, Towerfall Ascension, Undertale, Xenonauts, Abzu, Inside, Black Mesa, Superhot, Rain World, Duck Game, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Subnautica, Garry's Mod, Jackbox Party Pack 2, Mordheim, Oddworld New and Tasty, Dark Souls II, Etc. 
   
  
**When possible, list alternatives that you'd be interested in in descending order of desirability and I will let you know if any would work out.**

GE_151017,"091017  

Soooooooooo I was standing on the ground floor, walking toward the frontyard, it seem like the rain just went off few minute ago  
In front of me is the road and the neighbor building cluster on the other side, behind those are a blue mountain, it have light reflecting from it ( like a wet object ), it was pretty damn beautiful with all these greener mountain on the horizon and yellow sunshine, my probably neighbor and a yellow fluffy dog stand there, I pet it then I decide to go upstair and get my cellphone to take a picture ( I also noted that my house's exterior has changed, it have a roof on top of the path that lead to the frontyard now ).

Looking up as I walking to the backyard, I saw a giant statue with many bushes and plants on it, surrounded by clouds, the shape of the character is very cartoony, but it still look omnious. As I arrived to the backyard, I saw a pond on the left with a bunch of frog sitting on rocks and plently of green seaweeds. In the middle is a wood/stone tower with a stair that lead to the top, behind it is a cliff that's probably hundreds meter deep. On the horizon is bright sunlight, oasis and desert.  
  
As I got to the top floor, saw my sis with her ex, got the phone so I get to the second floor's balcony to take a picture. Image on the phone, however, show a city with the Black Citadel (from Half-Life 2) and a portal storm, the Citadel phasing in and out of existence with an electric storm blast, sometime it's on the left, sometime it's on the right, I took 2 pictures anyway.  
  
The next part is I'm at somekind of asylum, there's this disgusting muddy pathway and I'm on my bare foot, fuck. On the right is a window, inside is a bunch of kids with laser blasting from their eyes, what ? At this point everything is pretty chaotic, I turn on my back and jump on the door as a mutant looking guy walk toward me, I then backflip off the wall on the right and walk toward the end of the passage, into the open door on the right and then I woke up.  
  
That is totally not everything happen in the dream but that's the whole thing that I can make sense of, the rest is...perplexing.

THE LAST JEDI TRAILER WHAT THE FFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUCK I JIZZ MESELF !  
NEW DUST 2 TEASER WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT  
Today I was high.  
  
So the dream: I was at this trainstation ( there's only this small booth and several railroads nearby ). A guy with his shotgun ( could probably bolt rifle ), a bear and it's cub coming at him, he shot them both in the head but somehow the cub survive. When the cub is bandaged it was on the chest, not the head, not sure wtf happened. I have it in my lap as I travel on this hi-speed train toward 'home'
On the left is a big open window, a giant cable-like structure leading toward a tower, you can see the electric constantly arcing from the cable ( it really looks like a giant train tbh ). The next thing I know is the guy with the shotgun from moment earlier were killed and I must chase down his killer, I have this sword that can create an invisible force wave that can cut a building in halves from miles away, it make a really metal blade ring along with a sharp air slicing sound.
Chasing the killer on the street, we're both on our car ( mine was a convertible apparently ) he had a blue hat (?), as he turn around from the street corner I cut him with the magic sword ( you can see it cut through the cloud, it's actually pretty amazing ), I also sliced his blade in halves, somehow.

[NA] gold Top looking for Duo for end of season plat rush,"Been up and down between G5 and G3 all season. Mostly a Poppy 1trick, but I bust out the Riven, Maokai, and Rumble on occasion.

54% winrate on Poppy in 220 games, 57% last year in 192. (2.7KDA) 58% winrate on Riven in 40 games. (2.0 KDA)

I queue my secondary as AD but I'm decent at anything if I get filled.

Looking for anyone else in Gold or higher to duo and try to make the push to plat before the season ends. I have discord if you want, but I'm also plenty comfortable communicating with text and pings.

I'm 25 and would prefer someone 18+.

[Theory] What Kylo's lines in the Last Jedi Trailer Actually Meant,"Kylo is actually talking about Vader. Not Leia. I think Kylo will find out that Vader turned back to the light and it kills him. He can't bear the thought that his ""role model"" Vader was not who he thought. So in order to ""let  the past die"" he destroys any connections he has to Vader.  So when Kylo says ""Kill it if you have to"" he means physically destroying his connections to Vader.  I mean we see in the trailer that he smashes the remains of Vader's helmet and is perhaps why whe don't see him wear his in the rest. And in the last bit of he says this ""its the only way you can become who you were meant to be"". Which I believe is him saying in order to become his strongest self he has to stop looking to the past, to what he thought Vader was and instead look to the future.

Rey's Parentage,"Every Star Wars fan is contemplating Rey's parents...I don't think it's her parents who are that important, but her grandfather, Emperor Palpatine. Perhaps Snoke is really Palpatine, concealing his true identity. Snoke/Palpatine is using Ren and will kill him when the time is right, revealing himself when he is strong enough. Ren wants to follow in his grandfather's steps (Vader) and Snoke/Palpatine knows how important this is to him. Snoke/Palpatine is pitting Ren against Rey, just ask Palpatine and Vader battled in ROTJ. Snoke/Palpatine will at last have his vengeance on Skywalker/Vader when he kills his grandson, completing the cycle. Afterall, Rey utilizes the same forward thrust stab on her opening move the first time she handles the lightsaber against Ren. And the forward thrusting stab is the opening move the Emperor utilized against the Jedi when they attempted to arrest him. This is the reason why Luke had the forlorn look in his eye when Rey locates him at the end of The Force Awakens. He knows she probably is unaware of her familial history. Perhaps Luke someone found and rescued Rey as a child and dropped her off on Jakku?

"There are seriously tons of options available to DICE when creating cosmetic items for this game, all while staying authentic to Star Wars","At first I was thinking that DICE couldn't do nearly as many cosmetic items for this game as other developers do with theirs.  After all, we want the game to remain as visually authentic to Star Wars as possible.  The last thing we want is pink and zebra striped Storm Troopers running around the battlefield, or even the helmetless Storm Troopers from the last game for that matter(thank goodness those guys are gone).

The more I thought about it though, the more I realized that there are seriously tons of options available for cosmetic items in this game, all while remaining authentic to Star Wars.  

Let's go through the different things that they can do for cosmetic items in this game.

 - Hero Skins

Some of the heroes seriously have a ton of options for skins in the game.  Just going with Luke for instance, there are over a dozen different skins that I can think up for him just off the top of my head.

His default skin will obviously be his outfit from Return of the Jedi.  From there though, we seriously have plenty of additional options.

Farm boy Luke
Storm Trooper Luke
Farm boy Luke with Storm Trooper utility belt
Pilot Luke without helmet
Pilot Luke with helmet
Award Ceremony Luke
Hoth Luke
Dagobah Luke without jacket
Bespin Luke with jacket
Return of the Jedi Luke with cloak from beginning of the film
Return of the Jedi Luke with unbuttoned tunic
Return of the Jedi pilot Luke with green lightsaber
Endor Luke with Rebel helmet

Granted, some of these different skins aren't much different from one another, but they all give us some more visual variety.  So just going with original trilogy movie appearances, we already have over a dozen different skin options for Luke.  Based on trailers so far though, we know one of Leia's appearances is from the comic books, so that's another source for skins.  Granted, not all of the heroes have as many skin options as Luke, especially the villains who in some cases basically have only one look, but even they could be given extra skins through things like battle damaged skins and stuff like that.

So right out of the gate, we already know that hero skins alone can be used to create a ton of cosmetic items.

 - Trooper Skins

Trooper skins also present a major opportunity for cosmetic items.  

Let's start with just the Rebel and Resistance troopers.  Right off the bat each trooper should have the option to choose gender and race for humans.  Throw in facial hair options and there are already dozens upon dozens of options that they could create for human characters.  

Moving on to alien characters though, they have a massive opportunity there as well.  First off, just creating a bunch of different races is already great.  Beyond that though, they can create many skins for each race.  One way to do that is by simply offering both genders for the alien races.  That does take extra voice work however.  An even simpler option for adding more alien skins is by offering different skin colors where it makes sense.  We know that Twi'leks have multiple different skin tones available for instance.  Therefore, they could just take the default skin and apply different colors to it, easily creating more skin options.  The Zabraks are also great for this approach.  They are known for having unique tattoo patterns for instance, therefore, they could just use the same model and create multiple different skins by varying the tattoo patterns.  There are other alien races they could apply those same techniques to as well.

By doing simple things like that, they can easily raise the number of alien skill options available.

The next area where they can do a lot for skins is the Grand Army of the Republic.  This has already been spoken about by others who are even bigger Clone Wars fans than me, so I won't go into exhausting detail.  Simply allow different armor patterns on the clones, similar to the ones we see in the movies and The Clone Wars show.  That opens up a ton of skin options right off the bat.  Simply make the color scheme match the clone legion for each map and we're golden.

As for the droids, they might be a little harder as they are already color coordinated based on class, with all four classes essentially using the same model with different colors.  I'm sure some of you could probably tell me some good ways to come up with different skins for the Separatists though. ;)

The Empire, while necessarily more limited than the Rebels has a decent amount of skins available as well.  Just within the officer class, there are a number of different color options available between their outfits, as well as the distinction between armored and unarmored officers.  Storm Troopers also have the option for different pauldrons like in the last game.  The heavy could easily have a shock trooper skin as well.

The First Order is the army that I see seemingly having the fewest skin options, but maybe you guys already can think of a few good variants.

Regardless, trooper skins already present a huge opportunity for skins in the game.

 - Vehicle Skins

Now this one obviously doesn't have as many options as the trooper skins, but there are still possibilities.

First off, we know that depending on the squadron, Rebel ships had different colored stripes.  The Battle of Scarif in Rogue One had both red and blue striped X-Wings for instance.  Therefore, it wouldn't hurt to add some different options for the coloring on Rebel ships.  The same may even hold true for Resistance ships, I believe one of the earlier trailers for TLJ showed both blue and burgundy colored A-Wings in a hangar shot.

As for the Empire, while they didn't usually have a lot of visual variety, we do know that some of the ace pilots had red stripes on their TIE Fighters.  So there's some variety for the Imperials as well.

As far as the clone wars goes, I don't think we saw much visual variety between fighters of the same type for either side.  Sure, the paint jobs were sometimes a bit different on the droid star fighters and what not, but that seemed to be specific to different droid attachments in the Separatist army.  Maybe I'm wrong though, I'd be happy to be corrected on that point.

The First Order we simply don't know enough about right now.  Based on what we do know though, I don't really think that they do have any visual differences between ships of the same type.

Still though, we do definitely have some additional cosmetic options for the ships.

 - Reinforcements

This area is probably the most limited, but there are still options for some of the reinforcements.  The LAAT could have some different skin options for instance, as we know some of them had custom decals and paint jobs in the Clone Wars.  They could also create different skins for the Wookiee by varying the color pattern on his fur.

Not a whole lot they can do in this area IMO, but they aren't completely without options.

 - Emotes

Now this area is somewhat divisive among some of the fans.  That being said, they basically have unlimited options here.  Let's just keep things like dances and real world references out them though please.

As for the hero emotes, they have a ton of options as well.  Han Solo has tons of iconic lines beyond the two they used in the Beta for instance.  They could do a dozen for him easy.

 - Victory Poses

This one is obviously the most throwaway of the bunch.  I don't think anyone really cares about these to be honest.  That being said, they basically could create as many of these as they like.  Let's hope we don't see too many though, as they are just filler items.


So, just looking at the options available, they really do have a ton of cosmetic options available for this game, all while staying true to authentic Canon.  Let's hope they take advantage of their ability to bring plenty of authentic visual variety to the Battlefront.",StarWarsBattlefront,185,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/76h31g/there_are_seriously_tons_of_options_available_to/,,Admiral_Petty,76h31g,/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/76h31g/there_are_seriously_tons_of_options_available_to/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/76h31g/there_are_seriously_tons_of_options_available_to/,38,2017-10-15

TLJ in 2-months. Get your First Order and Resistance characters farmed *now*,"The Last Jedi releases in theaters 2-months from today.  We already know First Order is needed for BB-8 when he comes back around, and it's extremely likely that Resistance will be needed for an event at some point in the near future.

Consider the last major Star Wars movie released, Rogue One.  With that release we got:  Jyn, Cassian, Baze, Chirrut, K2SO, Bodhi, Pao, Bistan, Scarif Rebel Trooper, Death Trooper, Krennic, Shore Trooper, TIE Reaper, Bistan's U-Wing, Cassian's U-Wing.  These characters and ships are still relevant in every facet of the game, and this wasn't a 'saga' movie.

We'll be seeing a ton of content focused on the First Order and Resistance soon.

"""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win""","https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/75gt1h/making_rasianamerican_better_harassment_trolls/

I delayed the response to the r/aa drama for a while, because their post is giving us quite a bit of extra unique IP traffic. Lol. Thanks for that chingleberry! Wouldn't want you to take the post down before the unique traffic stopped.

---

**""then they fight you"" &lt;--- we are here.**

While /r/asianamerican started 7 years ago, /r/aznidentity was created for less than 2 years. And already we are getting higher pageviews and activity than /r/asianamerican. Pretty much at all hours of the day, there is more ""users here now"" on /r/ai than on /r/aa. The place where discussions happen is here, not r/aa. 

Haven't you noticed? On /r/aa, you are not allowed to express a POV that deviates from the mainstream American democrat line. You are only allowed to circlejerk over safe topics that outside non-asian groups already gave you the stamp of approval to talk about. It is no wonder why there is desperate need for discussion spaces outside of /r/aa.

In the beginning, /r/aa policy was focused on ignoring us. If you even talk about ""that other asian sub that could not be named"", it is a comment removal (or ban if chingleberry doesn't like you).

After we gained a few thousands followers, I started to see them trying to laugh at us, ""anger shame"" us, trying little snide remarks like how we have ""too much comments"" (lol, it's your fault that you have a boring straitjacket comment environment). Mentioning any Asian splinter subs (/r/aznidentity, /r/asianmasculinity, /r/hapas, /r/easternsunrising, even /r/sino) is forbidden, or else it's a ban.

And now after our user activities shoot straight past /r/aa, chingleberry finally realize they can not ignore this threat any further. So chingle broke down and finally engineered this massive multi-sub attack, to misrepresent and smear our reputation, even calling in multiple outside non-asian subs to join in this attack.

But the attack simply validates what we are doing here. Posting it across multiple subs all at once? All of the regular toxic /r/asiantwox users who normally would never make a comment in /r/aa all chime in exactly on time in chingle's thread? Come on now. This is meticulously planned well in advance with off-reddit coordination. If we are just some crazy fringe movements with no legitimacy and your sub did not fail to fully serve the interests of the Asian reddit community, why did you even bother to launch this massive attack?

**criticism against you because you are a horrible leader =/= harassment ""because you are a woman""**

/u/chinglishese, please stop pretending that our criticism of you is ""harassment because you are a woman or you are in WMAF"". Quit deflecting. **You are not a normal user. You are going to be under higher scrutiny.** Quit acting like a victim. You also know exactly what you did wrong. It is like Trump whining about ""fake media harassing me again, wah wah"". If a leader calls criticism harassment, then s/he doesn't deserve to be a leader. If you get off the head mod position, this ""harassment"" will end immediately.

**We criticize you and want you off the mod team of r/aa because you have proved time and again to be a horrible and harmful mod of the reddit Asian community.**

1. In the classic fashion of all [PAA](https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/48qqvc/new_acronym_paa_progressive_asian_activist/), [(example)](https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/515nut/paas_progressive_asian_activists_have_judged/), **you are NOT loyal to the community** (and I am not talking about your dating choices, stop using that as a shield). Your actions have again and again prove to act contrary to the community's interests. **Your subreddit constantly force us to kneel to the request of outside groups and serve the interests of a outside group (democrats, BLM, whoever you deem superior to us in the social justice hierarchy).**

 &gt; I met /u/chinglishese once. It was a strange experience.
She was a bit weird, a bit attention seeking, but a nice person, kept to herself, quiet, kept her head down and worked hard. Not so different from you and I in that sense.

 &gt; The strange part was that some combination of her slightly too made up countenance and cloying aura of magazine sample perfume brought up intense memories from my days as a broke college student, standing over a messy kitchen counter spreading mayonnaise on spongy Costco bread.

 &gt; ---

 &gt; Oh man you met her too?

 &gt; When I met her it was sometime before November 2016. I was at one of those farm-to-table hipster restaurants in Brooklyn discussing a possible move back to East Asia should the Cheeto Presidency become a thing with my white friend Hanson (he's cool, his girlfriend is black).

 &gt; **No sooner had I uttered ""Donald might"" when /u/chinglishese burst into our conversation apropos of nothing.** She looked flustered, like she hadn't slept in days, about an inch of black root shining under her asian blonde dye job. 

 &gt; **Pounding the table defiantly, she proclaimed, ""Hillary Clinton is the Last Jedi.""**

 And r/aa reflects this persona exactly. Everyone is essentially forced to goosestep the white democrat line. If you sound off, you are axed. If you deviate from the rhetoric, you are axed. If you care about some issues that differ from mainstream democrat trendy yuppie issues, you are axed (oh, and you are weird, why would you care about those unimportant issues).
 
 Example: One user made a [thoughtful, inoffensive video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDwjNf8Tik4) about his experiences and identity, navigating anti-Asian racism as a Canadian-born Chinese person, but it was [immediately hidden](https://i.imgur.com/OBP1jIL.jpg). (credits to u/jumara for this example)

 What does it say about the state of Asian America and /r/aa when the **3rd most highest upvoted post** is [a black dude coming in giving validation to Asians for calling out anti-blackness in Asian community](https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/64uneb/as_a_black_dude_browsing_this_sub/), ahead of United doctor, Jarred Ha. It is pathetic how the r/aa community is made to hunger for outside validation. Classic PAAism.

 **You are only allowed to get angry at issues that democrats deem socially acceptable to get angry at. And since mainstream left don't give a shit about Asian issues, PAA on r/aa always put other groups' interests in front of our own.**

2. **[You dismiss our most critical issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/2vm7wd/biweekly_vent_thread_whats_bothering_you/cojia7q/?context=3)**.

 &gt; I removed it because literally half the posts were using the poor dude's death to push some sort of anti-feminist agenda. Extremely poor taste and not conductive towards discussion.

 A famous AM blogger was driven to suicide because of his loneliness due to rejection by his race as a male. You removed it because you deemed it anti-feminist. What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you get how important the conversation is to many people? You only recently *grudgingly* accept that there is something wrong with emasculation, but ONLY BECAUSE THE SPLINTER SUBS reached more activity than you.

 Those here long enough since before /r/am glory days remembered this incident being the impetus for mass migration to /r/am. Our split have nothing to do with your personal life or the fact that you are a woman. Stop making this about YOU. 

3. **You are egotistical and care mostly about yourself.** Everything we talk about, you somehow see it as an attack on your WMAF relationship. Everything to protect your WMAF relationship, right? 

 &gt; - Another user posted this Harvard Crimson article, [""Yellow Love, Politics, and Poetry"" by Christinia Qiu](http://www.thecrimson.com/column/new-romantix/article/2016/10/11/interracial-relationships/), only for it to be deleted. When asked why it was removed, the mod responded with a sarcastic [""It's definitely bc I was dating a white dude 2 years ago.""](https://i.imgur.com/oZb8PSs.png) - r/esr

 I mean what kind of cringy shit is this. No one fucking cares you are dating a white dude. **It is not about you. Stop shutting down conversation about problematic interracial relationships, because you see it as direct to you.**

 And look at your https://www.reddit.com/user/chinglishese?sort=top posts, when 7 out of 10 of your top posts of all time is about your drama with us and trying to get outsiders and non-asians to side with you on your communal bickering with us, how can you argue against the fact that you're an egotistical maniac?

4. **You care more about your control over the community than the best interests of it.** Look at your recent drama. Your crosspost into multiple non-asian subs because you know you don't have enough support from your own people, so you have to get outsiders to come in to bully your own community, labeling AM as a misogynist harassing douchebag in the process.

 Hell, even people on r/aa called you out. /u/rickglue

 &gt; What I'm curious about is why you cross-posted to a bunch of other subs about it too, some not even asian related. What you're communicating to the broader audience is that all asian men are bitter, angry and toxic losers. In fact I read through some comments on those other subs to which you cross-posted and already saw not an insignificant amount of comments demeaning asian men as pathetic red pill losers and such.

 **How pathetic is that? Due to legitimate criticism on you as a mod and your loss of control over the community, you try to get outsiders to bully people of your own community, in a power struggle to regain your power?**

 You xposted to into 6 different subs, r/FemmeThoughts, r/TrollXChromosomes, r/blackladies, r/AgainstHateSubreddits, r/racism, r/DiscussTheOpenLetter. Wow, amazing. This goes back to the previous points. **Disloyal and egotistical**. 

 You even got the attention of well known racist ccj sexpat-troll, supporting you. And they are getting upvoted in your sub.

 https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/75gt1h/making_rasianamerican_better_harassment_trolls/do8fe38/ (r/china ccj sexpat troll)

 https://np.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/75tate/a_link_from_another_sub_reddit_showing_what_the/ (r/ph white sexpat-troll)

 You resort to getting racist sexpats (who have a strong superiority complex over Asians) to support you? That can't possibly be a good look for you. They are supporting you because you are the best possible ""activist"" they can plant in the movement. **You are the modern Amy Tan: too scared to aggressively confront white supremacy, so you devote all your time in community infighting/power-struggle. Your highest priority is the protection of your own personal relation with a white partner.**

---

**For those who have been with us on /r/aznidentity, I thank you for your loyalty and contribution, and also your tolerance towards my own flaws as a mod.** I do get overheated in argument and end up saying immature insults. I apologize that I may have driven some loyal members away in petty arguments. Moving forward and further growing our sub will require all of our effort, but every factor points to us outgrowing /r/aa within 2 years. The future is bright for our new brand of Asian activism, which will finally break the cycle of history, where the useless, ineffective, old brand of PAAism dominated.

**For the mods and frequent users on our cousin subreddits, r/asianmasculinity, r/hapas, r/easternsunrising, I thank you for existing and fighting alongside us against this white democrat agent-american infiltrating and controlling our community.**

We have our differences in the past, but in the end, our interests and goals are at least the same. We all want to stand up to the strongest and most well-defended form of white supremacy (the white democrat supremacy via media and WMAF). I deeply respect that you guys are unwavering towards this goal, despite endless shaming from the rest of reddit. 

There is nothing more important than having this spine to stand up against this social current and stop this WMAF menace/vested interest group from infiltrating and controlling our community from the core.

**For those of our sympathizers on /r/asianamerican and /r/asianbros but haven't made the jump yet, be on the right side of history.** Within 2 years of our creation, we have reached over half the subscriber count of /r/aa and reached far more activity. Looking at the growth of our subs, /r/ai is bound to exceed /r/aa in less than 2 years. And with r/aa mod team being so incompetent and disloyal, censoring core topics that Asian Americans want to talk about, our growth absolutely will continue.

If you have disagreement to the activities and comments on the sub, we are open to discussion as always. You are welcomed to our sub anytime. Participation on /r/aa doesn't mean you will be banned or unwelcomed from /r/ai, unlike the other way around. **Be on the right side who won't be overbearing towards your freedom of association.**

Notice how 99.9999% of the times, there is only ever people defecting from /r/aa to /r/ai (or to /r/am, /r/hapas, /r/esr) and never the reverse. We will keep growing and they will keep losing.

The only case ever of reverse defection is /u/notanotherloudasian, who chingleberry probably did a lot of work to recruit, because she had high level access to our information in our slack. Nala, I hope you realize you are treated well because she can use you. You think if you are a normal Asian feminist, she will make you a mod on /r/aa so fast? You think she will make /u/natalie-ng or /u/jumara or /u/misshaiga or even anybody on /r/asiantwox a mod of /r/aa so fast? Test out how much she really likes you. Try to speak up against her. Good luck. The only dissent she will allow you is if you argue for her interests even harder than her. What a perfect dictator.

Despite their smear campaign, we have multiple explicit rules to protect against actual misogyny (despite what WMAF infiltrators try to claim, criticizing WMAF is not misogyny. WMAF is literally the most promoted interracial relationship by mainstream white America. It is exactly the same as crying white male oppression).

Despite their smear campaign, we have multiple explicit rules against harassment and doxxing. Read the side bars. They are enforced, which is why most of the ""evidence"" chingleberry had is from our slack, which is mostly unmoderated.",aznidentity,48,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/76lby8/first_they_ignore_you_then_they_laugh_at_you_then/,Drama,the0clean0slate,76lby8,/r/aznidentity/comments/76lby8/first_they_ignore_you_then_they_laugh_at_you_then/,https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/76lby8/first_they_ignore_you_then_they_laugh_at_you_then/,17,2017-10-15

Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen... Plot Outline v4.0 - Trailer Edition,"The trailer has finally arrived and it's time to issue the fourth draft of my plot prediction for TLJ. The trailer confirmed several predictions from my earlier drafts:  

- Rey ends up with Snoke.  
- Kylo Ren pursues Rey to bring her with him.  
- Kylo Ren's presence on Crait on the side of the First Order.  

The biggest revelation and addition is Kylo attacking the Resistance fleet and deciding whether to destroy the ship his mother is on (which supplants their brief encounter on D'Qar from my earlier drafts). With that said, here are links to my previous drafts and then the fourth draft.  

To view this with pictures, [go here](https://swshadowcouncil.wordpress.com/2017/10/10/robotical712s-plot-prediction-post-trailer/).

This is based on my full [background theory](https://swshadowcouncil.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/robotical712s-full-background-theory/).

[July 24 – Version 1.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/6pajgn/the_three_act_structure_applied_to_tlj/)  

[Aug. 11 – Version 2.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/6t1y1n/tlj_plot_speculation_second_draft/)  

[Oct. 3 – Version 3.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/73igsr/tlj_plot_speculation_v3_pretrailer/)  

###Act I
  
**Space:**  
  
The opening is tricky since TFA ended on a cliffhanger. Traditionally, all Star Wars movies open in space, but that can’t really be done for Ahch-To. With Finn still in a coma and Kylo en route to Snoke, it’s also unlikely to open with an attack on D’Qar. Given the tradition of opening with a Star Destroyer in the shot, the natural place to start is with Kylo going to Snoke. TLJ will likely follow tradition and pan down (or up) to a First Order Star Destroyer with Kylo’s shuttle emerging and going to Snoke’s Super Star Destroyer. There, gold-robed Snoke will chew him out for his failure on Starkiller and tell him they need to find Luke and Rey quickly. Snoke will order Kylo to join the attack on the Resistance at D’Qar and to bring the map to him. Upset with himself over his warring emotions, Kylo probably punches his helmet into a wall after moving away from Snoke.  
  
**D’Qar:**  
  
With Finn in a coma, he’s the perfect expy for reminding the audience of what happened in a movie many of them last saw two years ago. He also needs to be back on his feet so the rest of the movie’s action can happen. So, we’ll see Finn wake up, have a brief scene with Poe and get a quick recap of what happened and whats about to happen. Finn will naturally want to know about Rey, which nicely sets up the next scene. In the mean time, the rest of the Resistance is preparing to evacuate and many surviving ships from the New Republic have joined them. Admiral Holdo will appear and talk to Leia and then she and Poe will head to orbit.  

**Ahch-To:**

Ahch-To opens as we last saw it in TFA, Rey extending the saber to Luke. Luke does go to and accepts the lightsaber in disbelief. He senses he knows her, but dismisses it as a delusion (1). Rey tells him she’s there on behalf of Leia and they need him. Shocking her, Luke hands back the lightsaber and tells her he can’t help and walks away. Despite Rey’s pleas and arguments, Luke shuts himself in a hut, telling her to leave.  
  
Frustrated and needing to regroup, Rey goes back to the Falcon. On her way, she notices a large sea creature menacing what appear to be a number of bird-like creatures and their nests. Feeling compelled to act, Rey intervenes and fends off the sea creature gaining the gratitude of the birds (Porgs). It turns out Luke has also witnessed her defense of the Porgs and she’s earned his grudging respect and curiosity. Luke tells her she can spend the night with him if she wants and he’ll try to explain, but she needs to leave afterwards. In the meantime, Chewie befriends the porgs.  
  
**D’Qar:**  
On D’Qar, the Resistance is frantically trying to leave before the First Order arrives. With their location known, the First Order is going to waste no time attempting to wipe out the only remaining organized opposition to their domination of the galaxy. Leia will tell Finn Maz has contacted her and knows somone who could help them. She asks Finn to meet with her on behalf of the Resistance, but Finn will initially turn it down, wanting to find Rey and get away from the conflict. While waiting for a ship, Finn will meet Rose who is in awe of him. Surprised by the attention and not wanting to disappoint her, Finn plays along claiming he’s going on a mission from Leia. The First Order will arrive and institutes a blockade while the Dreadnought moves into position to punch through the shield and destroy the base. Finn and Rose procure a transport, but are unable to leave while the blockade is in place.  

  
Poe, meanwhile, rallies the Resistance starfighter and bomber corps and plans to punch a whole in the blockade. The starfighters engage the FO’s fighters and protects the bombers as they head towards one of the blockading destroyers. Poe attempts an attack on the Dreadnought, but fails to get through the shields. In desperation, they attack one of the escorts and managed to disable it. Resistance transports manage to get through the hole with heavy losses. Finn and Rose join the exodus, frantically evading TIEs on the way, but make it to hyperspace and head towards Canto Bight.  While this is happening, Kylo will arrive (likely with friends) and infiltrate the base in search of the map. After he finds it and leaves, the FO dreadnought gets in position and annihilates the base.

**D’Qar:**  

Desperate to convince Luke to come with her and teach her, Rey shows Luke what she can do. Her display of power terrifies Luke though, recognizing it as the power Ben had. Terrified of leading Rey down the same path, Luke tells her he can’t train her and when she persists, he shows her the events of Ben’s fall. The last part of the vision will be of the most painful event of Luke’s life – losing his daughter, Rey. In complete shock, Rey stumbles out of the cave and collapses The vision will also leave Rey thinking Kylo was the one to abandon her.

###Act II
  
The first part of Act II will consist of the reunion of Rey with her father, Luke. It will be during this stage that Luke shows her what he’s learned about the Force and shows her the Force tree and the books. (2) It’s likely we’ll hear a bit about Rey’s mother as well. Happy, but also feeling scared and lost, Luke reaches out to his Jedi Masters for guidance. For, Rey it will seem like she’s getting everything she ever wanted and the goal of bringing Luke into the fight will appear within reach.

**Canto-Bight:**  
(3) Rose and Finn arrive on Canto-Bight and set about finding where Maz is. First they try the Casino. Rose learns she’s at a local cafe, but Finn gets distracted by the excitement and manages to win big. Unfortunately, this insenses one of the players he has beaten who sends his henchmen after Finn. Rose and Finn make thier way to the racing stables and steal a horse. A chase ensues, but Rose manages to throw off the pursuit and they ride to the cafe where Maz is. Maz tells them a master slicer known as DJ might be willing to help the Resistance, but he’s currently held in the Canto-Bight jail. Rose and Finn manage to locate and break him out and he agrees to go with them. They reach DJ’s ship after shaking off Canto-Bight’s law enforcement.  

**Resistance Fleet:**  

After leaving D’Qar, Kylo attacks the fleeing Resistance fleet and devastates it, destroying Poe’s X-Wing in the process. As he prepares to fire on the bridge of the Raddus, Kylo senses his mother aboard. He struggles with himself to pull the trigger, but is unable to bring himself to and he leaves the rest of the Resistance fleet behind and heads for Ahch-To. Poe, Leia and Admiral Holdo discuss what to do next and their discussion gets increasingly heated. The admiral will likely favor a last-ditch attack on the FO, while Leia and Poe will argue for finding a place to consolidate and continue the fight.

###Midpoint

**Ahch-To:**  

Kylo arrives, but is shot down and crash-lands. Luke tells Rey not to fight Kylo, but Rey is overcome by intense anger from what she thinks her cousin did to her and confident from her previous vision attacks him anyway. Kylo has his henchmen attack Luke, who easily dispatches them without a lightsaber. In the mean time Kylo and Rey spar and she accuses him of taking her from her from Luke. Kylo tells her he didn’t abandon her, he tried to save her and Luke was the one who abandoned her. This wrecks Rey’s concentration and Kylo manages to force her over a cliff and then runs. Luke is forced to rescue Rey and let him get away.

**Canto-Bight:**  
Rose contacts the resistance and learns they’re heading to Crait. Somehow the FO has learned of their location and Finn and Rose realize the Dreadnought has to be disabled. DJ says he can disable the ship’s main weapons, but needs them to get him a link inside the ship. the two make it aboard the ship and make their way to fire control. They’re able to give DJ the link he needs and he sabotages the weapon. On their way out, they’re discovered. In a running fight, they make it to a hanger bay and wreck many of the ships there.  
  
It looks like they’ll get away, but Phasma and a contingent of stormtroopers enter and engage them. Although they’re able to dispatch the stormtroopers with quick thinking, Phasma engages Finn in one on one melee combat. Phasma will probably gain the upper hand at some point, but forget about Rose, who distracts her long enough for Finn to recover. Finn takes off her arm and likely kills her.  
  
**Resistance Fleet:**  
The dispute between Poe, Leia and Holdo has come to a head and Holdo has Leia removed from the bridge (possibly imprisoned or confined to quarters). Realizing he needs to act now, Poe gathers loyal Resistance members and stages a mutiny, seizing the bridge. He has Leia released and leads the fleet to Crait.

**Ahch-To:**  

In a second Forceback, Rey experiences Kylo’s memories in ascending chronological order. During it, she sees things from Kylo’s perspective, including the effects of her disappearance. She also sees one of her own memories – Luke leaving her on a desert planet. Crucially, she (and we) can’t tell which desert planet, but she assumes it’s Jakku. At the end of the vision, she sees her father in a very different light and it devastates her (3). Luke returns and she accuses him of abandoning her and the rest of his family. Unleashing years of grief and frustration, Luke loses control for a moment as he emotionally denies it and unleashes a massive display of the Force, wrecking the hut they’re in. Rey and Kylo are unharmed, but Rey is now terrified as well. Deciding her family wasn’t worth the fourteen years she spent waiting, she decides her real place is with her friends. Abandoning her family, as she believes they once abandoned her, she boards the Falcon and leaves her father and cousin behind. Overcome by emotion himself, Luke doesn’t try to stop her. Luke warns Kylo things aren’t what he thinks. Kylo has a chance to kill Luke, who’s too overcome by grief to defend himself, but can’t bring himself to do it. Kylo takes his dead companions’ shuttle and leaves Luke alone and stranded once again.

###Act 3:

**Crait:**  
Rey learns the Resistance is on Crait and heads there before the FO fleet arrives. She tells Leia bitterly that Luke isn’t coming. Leia, sensing her niece’s distress, immediately leaves for Ahch-To herself. The only ship that could make it out of the blockade is the Falcon and she enlists Chewie’s help. FO fighters pursue them, but Chewie manages to lose them in the caves and heads to orbit and Ahch-To.  

Finn and Rose also escape the Dreadnought and head to Crait. The Dreadnought attempts to fire, but it misfires, wrecking the ship. The FO is forced to deploy ground forces. Severely outnumbered and outgunned, the Resistance sends its forces to meet the FO, using the bombers to create a screen from the dust. The battle begins and Rey assists in bringing down several walkers before sensing Kylo is in the Resistance base and going to find him.  

**Ahch-To:**  
On Ahch-To, Leia lands and finds a thoroughly dispirited Luke. During a brief conversation, Leia reminds him that she lost her son to the dark side, but he hasn’t lost Rey yet and still has a chance with her.  

The Resistance is putting up a brave, but futile fight. The FO’s firepower is overwhelming and they’re steadily pushed back or destroyed. Kylo engages her, but merely defends himself while offering to show Rey who she is. Despairing, Rey offers herself in return for the lives of her friends. Kylo agrees and orders the attack stopped. Kylo offers his hand, which Rey takes and brings Rey to a shuttle as Finn and Poe watch, stunned. As their shuttle lifts off, Hux, at Snoke’s urging orders the ground attack to resume, dismaying Kylo and panicking Rey. She calms however as she senses a powerful and familiar presence nearby.  

As the FO presses its attack, a figure appears on the horizon. Figuring one person isn’t a threat, the FO troops ignore him until one of their walkers is impossibly picked up and thrown into another. The FO turns all of it’s weapons on the lone figure and begin firing. The figure, Luke, uses the Force to block and divert everything thrown at him as he methodically wrecks the FO forces without ever igniting his lightsaber. In the aftermath, the mood is somber. Luke turned the tide of the battle, but the Resistance’s losses are massive and the loss of Rey is a bitter blow. Content with his prize, Snoke withdraws and welcomes Rey with a demonstration of his power as Kylo brings her before him.  

The movie ends with Luke with Leia both looking out of a ships window in a callback to ESB, determined looks on their faces.  

**Notes:**  

1: I think Luke’s initial inability to sense who she or dismissal of it is will be used to signal just how clouded his mind has become. He’s become unable to hear or believe what the Force is telling him.   

2: My initial instinct was to place these before the Force vision, but Luke watching Rey and teaching her about what he’s learned about the Force is inconsistent with the despairing mood he apparently has in the beginning. It would also delay getting to the heart of the movie, which is Luke and Rey reuniting. Therefore, it makes more sense to expect it after the first Forceback.  
  
3: If this seems to be throwing Luke under a bus, remember the characters are only acting based on their perceptions and what they know. Whether Luke is actually guilty of anything doesn’t matter; what matters is that Rey and Kylo think he is. IX will be where Rey (and we) get the full story.  

**Omissions:**  
  
1: Visiting the temple and what Luke learned there. Really not sure where this will go.  
  
2: DJ’s fate after Rose and Finn infiltrate the Dreadnought.  
  
3: Rose in Act 3.  

4: Snoke's guards in action.

Betrayal,"The Force Awakens had very strong themes that tied together the main characters.  Most of the heroes, Han, Finn, Rey, Luke and even Kylo Ren were struggling with the same issues.  Abandonment of duty was central to all their stories.  They all struggled with abandoning the fight in the face of fear and self doubt.  

Looking at The Last Jedi, it looks to me like the central characters are likely to be tied together by another common struggle, in this case dealing with betrayal.

That betrayal might loom large in the second film is not surprising.  It fits with patterns of storytelling.  It matches Empire Strikes Back.  It give us both conflict and change at a moment the story needs it.

From what we've seen, there will be lots of references to betrayal.  Finn is a traitor, and it looks like he may face execution for his betryal.  Likely he will also be betrayed as he tries to infiltrate the First Order.  Little is known about DJ, but he sounds like an untrustworty character, and a possible betrayer.  I think it's pretty likely Leia will be betrayed, possibly by Holdo.  

I think it highly likely that Ren betrays Snoke in this film.  Rey is very likely betrayed -- as Luke warns her that things aren't going to go the way she expects. Luke already feels betrayed by Ren.  That sense of betrayal may only be compounded by Rey.

The one that interests me the most though is Luke's betrayal of Rey.  He's certainly shown betraying Rey's expectations that he will be the hero she expects and that he will be the salvation everyone seeks.  But I think there will be a special moment beyond this in which Rey feels she has been particularly betrayed by Luke.

From the last trailer we know that Rey and Ren will join forces, but to push them together is no easy feat.  Luke certainly looks like he lays the groundwork by denying Rey a place, but I feel like we still need something more, a shocking moment of betrayal, a moment when she will question whether everything Luke has told her is a lie.

It does look from the trailers that she has to search for truth on her own, perhaps she goes beyond a boundary he sets.  Maybe she discovers something that he is hiding.  In any case, I feel like there has to be a special moment of betrayal for her to separate from her.

I'm just not sure what it is yet.",starwarsspeculation,13,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/76kjzj/betrayal/,SPECULATION,VulpeculaVincere,76kjzj,/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/76kjzj/betrayal/,https://www.reddit.com/r/starwarsspeculation/comments/76kjzj/betrayal/,12,2017-10-15

Theory: The Bounty Hunters from Empire were a team,"This is a departure from the Last Jedi theories that are everywhere- this will make you rethink what Boba Fett actually did from Empire Strikes Back.

In the Star Wars Clone Wars episode, ""Bounty"" we are presented with a team of bounty hunters that worked together. This team consisted of:

--Boba Fett (leader)

--Bossk

--Dengar

--Latts Razzi

--C-21 Highsinger

--Assaj Ventress

This team appeared to operate on multiple missions together (besides Ventress who left after her first mission). They seemed to have a good relationship with one another, suggesting that they had been working for a at least a couple of months.

Many years later, in Empire Strikes Back, Vader recruits exactly six bounty hunters to hunt Han Solo. They are:

--Boba Fett

--Bossk

--Dengar

--IG-88

--4-LOM

--Zuckuss

So of the millions of bounty hunters throughout the galaxy, Vader just happened to recruit three who used to be on a long term-team? That's awfully convenient.

I think a better explanation is that the team never broke up, and were still working together. Over the course of 20 years Latts and C-21 died or left, and they then recruited IG-88, 4-LOM, and Zuckuss. When Vader says ""no disintegrations"", he isn't just saying it to Boba Fett, he's saying it to the whole team. Boba Fett is the leader.

Furthermore, when Boba Fett pilots Slave One to follow the Falcon, it isn't just him. All six bounty hunters are in there. They then all go the Cloud City, only since Boba is the leader he's the only one shown doing the negotiations.

I'm sure the EU disregards this, but I think going off just the books and movies the theory makes more sense than the in-canon explanation. What do you think?

Meeting a Hero,"Frifth strained as he twisted the pommel one last time. He held the blue leather handle getting a feeling for the new and unfamiliar grip of his new [lightsaber](https://puu.sh/xYoYu.jpg). He pressed the red button and the green blade shone to life. Frifth sighed in bliss as he heard the familiar hum.

""Let me see it Padawan."" The Thisspiasian Jedi Artist said as she uncoiled her hands. Frifth de-activated the saber and gave it to her. She held it gingerly and balanced it between her snakelike fingers. She ignited it and swung it around in a figure eight then returned it to Frifth.

""It is a finely crafted lightsaber Frifth Nilim. Should you wish to modify it you need only return to me."" She said in a motherly way that made him think back to Master Varuna. Frifth smiled appreciatively and bowed his head respectfully. 

""I will. Thank you again Master, may the Force be with you."" Frifth said before leaving the room. 

Frifth hooked his new lightsaber onto his belt and he tucked his arms into his blue robes and pushed his lekku over so his left went around his neck. He walked out of the hallway and looked in awe at the large room. He put his hands on the banister as he looked down on the several Jedi walking through the temple. He went down the steps and looked over at a nearby bronze statue of a human Jedi. Frifth didn't stop as he looked and bumped into someone.

""Oh! I'm sorry about that."" Frifth said to the large blue skinned male Twi'lek. The Twi'lek was close to an Akranian male and a Human female. Frifth saw the Arkanian was aged looking and was likely a Jedi Master. Then it hit Frifth like a heavy blaster to the stomach. That was the Pacifist Peacebringer, Otthon Tahsis. He tried desperately to bring peace and order to the Outer Rim for many years. Frifth heard about him when he was on Lothal. Frifth ran around the large Twi'lek and took Otthon's four fingered hand in an excited handshake.

""My name is Frifth Nilim from Ryloth! We've never met, but I've heard much about you. Master Tahsis it is truly an honor to meet you!"" Frifth said excitedly, forgetting himself for a moment.",Starwarsrp,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/Starwarsrp/comments/76h55l/meeting_a_hero/,Active,DarkVaati13,76h55l,/r/Starwarsrp/comments/76h55l/meeting_a_hero/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Starwarsrp/comments/76h55l/meeting_a_hero/,23,2017-10-15

Scramble IX: Darth Vader Submission,"*""Do not pretend.
Retribution for forgiveness, betrayal for trust, despair for hope, darkness for light, dark death for the living.""* - Kirei Kotomine

**Name:** [Darth Vader](http://a.dilcdn.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/03/darth-vader-1-cover-header.jpg)

**Series:** Star Wars

**Theme:** [The Imperial March](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzWSJG93P8)

**Servant Class:** Rider

**Abilities:** Fights with a lightsaber, a sword of superheated plasma that can cut through practically anything. He is a master of lightsaber combat, specializing in Form V, a style of fighting that emphasized turning an opponent's attacks against themselves, whether in the variant Shien which was more useful against blaster fire, or Djem So which made counterattacks from an opponent's lightsaber movements whenever possible. He also has a strong connection to the Dark Side of the Force, giving him extensive telekinesis, enhanced physical abilities, and minor precognition, among other applications. What makes him a Rider over perhaps a Saber or a Caster is that even from a young age what set him apart from his peers was his unparalleled intuitive expertise with vehicles of all kinds, whether in podracing as a boy, to flying a starfighter as a Jedi, and later yet a personalized TIE Interceptor as a Sith Lord.

**Bio:** A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, a prophecy existed, telling of the Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. For centuries, the Jedi Order gave it little thought as they believed their ancient foes, the Sith Lords, to be extinct. Until one day Jedi Master Qui-gon Jinn found himself on Tatooine, a desert planet in the Outer Rim. There he met a young boy, Anakin Skywalker, who showed exceptional Force sensitivity and whose mother had apparently become pregnant with him spontaneously, with no father involved. Qui-gon became convinced that Anakin was the Chosen One meant to fulfill the prophecy, and went to great lengths in order to take Anakin with him back to the Jedi Temple for training. At first the Jedi Council refused, warning that the boy's emotions and attachment to his mother made him a dangerous candidate for Jedi training. They grudgingly changed their minds after Qui-gon and his apprentice, Obi-wan Kenobi, encountered and slew a Sith Lord, though Qui-gon also perished in the battle. Obi-wan was promoted to Jedi Knight and given Anakin as his apprentice. The boy grew into a man, and together Master and Apprentice survived many battles and tribulations, all the while under the watchful eye of Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, who was secretly a Sith Master manipulating the entirety of the Galaxy for his own machinations. Palpatine, whose Sith name was Darth Sidious, saw the power Anakin wielded and began grooming him to eventually be his apprentice. He played a very long game and finally, it all paid off in a single day. Anakin unwittingly assisted in the murder of Jedi Master Mace Windu and, overcome with guilt, fear, and rage, gave in to the dark side of the Force and became Sidious' apprentice, taking the name Darth Vader. He then assisted Sidious in systematically murdering every Jedi in the galaxy, though naturally a few survived. Vader went to the lava planet Mustafar and wiped out the leaders of the enemy faction that Sidious had been puppeteering to keep the Clone War raging on, and then Sidious reformed the Republic into a Galactic Empire, with himself at its head. Obi-wan Kenobi and Grand Master Yoda were among the survivors, and after realizing the extent of this catastrophe, split up to confront the Sith Lords. Yoda fought Sidious to no avail, barely escaping with his life, while Kenobi went to Mustafar with Padme Amidala, Anakin's pregnant wife. There Anakin lashed out at her and would have choked her to death if Obi-wan had not intervened. The duel between master and former apprentice was brutal, emotional, and long, though eventually Kenobi struck Vader down, leaving him missing three limbs and burning on the bank of a river of lava. Unable to strike a finishing blow, Obi-wan left, believing Vader would die shortly. Darth Sidious arrived some time later and was astonished to find Vader still alive, sustained by the dark side feeding on his rage and his pain. Taking what was left of him to a medical bay, Sidious was able to repair him through a cybernetic battle suit that gave him new robotic limbs, a foreboding helmet and mask, and an array of life support systems that operated at all times. Though for all intents and purposes, it didn't matter. He was still the second strongest being in the galaxy, and he enforced Palpatine's will with an iron fist, hunting down any remaining Jedi he could find. Meanwhile, Padme had died, but not before an emergency operation saved the twins she was carrying. With her last breaths she named them Luke and Leia. Luke would eventually grow up to become a Jedi and was able to redeem his father, bringing him to reject the Dark Side and kill Sidious, not out of rage but out of love for his son. The effort cost him his life, but he died Anakin Skywalker, the prophecy of the Chosen One fulfilled.

**Research:** [The Respect Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/5mctii/the_canon_darth_vader_respect_thread/)

Everything important is in the RT, though if the fancy strikes you, you could watch all of 3, Rogue One, 4, 5, and 6, in that order. You can watch episodes 1 and 2 if you really want to for the extra backstory, but uhh... those movies are not the series proudest moments for writing quality. The comic series Vader Down paints an excellent picture of the Dark Lord, as do the novels Lords of the Sith and Tarkin.

Also just in case specification is needed, this is Canon Darth Vader only. Everything in the respect thread is fair game, everything else from the old EU is not being used here.",morvis343,1,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/morvis343/comments/76gj90/scramble_ix_darth_vader_submission/,,morvis343,76gj90,/r/morvis343/comments/76gj90/scramble_ix_darth_vader_submission/,https://www.reddit.com/r/morvis343/comments/76gj90/scramble_ix_darth_vader_submission/,0,2017-10-15

Last Jedi Predictions!,"Rey and Kylo switch sides

Luke left everyone because he had to figure out how to defeat Snoke because Snoke is ancient. He's pissed at Kylo and doesn't think he's worth redeeming. He is fearful of Snoke and doesn't know if he can be defeated.

Luke is killed by Rey

Rey's parents are not important.

Finn becomes the leader of the Resistance

Poe dies.

Snoke is a shaman of the whills.

Rose is a double agent.

DJ will die fairly quickly.

Luke will singlehandedly bring down a walker and pilot the Millenium Falcon for the 1st time.

All pretty popular ideas but now they're all in one place.

Kylo and Luke will team up in The Last Jedi,"In the pub with friends and speculated this so apologies if it's completely wrong.

Anyway, going off the latest trailer, we think the scene of Lukes hand popping out through the rubble and Kyle extending his hand match up. This could also match with Lukes hand on R2D2 in Force Awakens trailer.

Lastly, as seen, all the previous star wars posters have the villains looming in the background. The Last Jedi has Luke looming.

Prediction: Luke Skywalker dies in The Last Jedi,"Not that I want it to happen, but recent Disney movies tend to give us surprises like this. Also, they have signaled The Last Jedi will be a darker movie, and what's a better way to make it dark than killing off a beloved character? Also in the Final Scene of the trailer, Rey says: ""I need someone, to show me my place in all this."" Now, why would she say something like that if Luke Skywalker is still alive? Isn't the last Jedi master a natural mentor in desperate times?

I would be happy to be wrong on this, but I have a strong feeling that my prediction will be fulfilled.",StarWars,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/76kw3x/prediction_luke_skywalker_dies_in_the_last_jedi/,Movies,ECEUndergrad,76kw3x,/r/StarWars/comments/76kw3x/prediction_luke_skywalker_dies_in_the_last_jedi/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/76kw3x/prediction_luke_skywalker_dies_in_the_last_jedi/,17,2017-10-15
