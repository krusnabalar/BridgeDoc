Comic-Con International: San Diego Megathread - Day Three,"This is the Comic-Con International: San Diego Megathread.  The comic convention (commonly called CCI, SDCC or simply Comic-Con) began on Thursday.  Day 0's Megathread can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/3cjq4c/comiccon_international_san_diego_megathread_day/). Day 1's megathread can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/3co8tz/comiccon_international_san_diego_megathread_day/).  Day 2's megathread can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/3cslm0/comiccon_international_san_diego_megathread_day/).

I'll be running separate megathreads for every day of the event.  The Megathreads will primarily serve as a hub for news, announcements, leaks and other stuff coming out of the convention.  I'll be linking to a variety of sites, including [CBR](http://comicbookresources.com), [Newsarama](http://newsarama.com), [Variety](http://variety.com), [THR](http://hollywoodreporter.com), [ComicBook.com](http://comicbook.com), [The Outhouse](http://theouthousers.com), [Comics Beat](http://comicsbeat.com) and assorted other sites.  I encourage you to visit all those sites.  I'll also be linking to relevant /r/comicbooks threads during the weekend.  If you want to hear my running commentary about the convention, feel free to follow me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/CatsComicsCbus).

In terms of comments, feel free to ask questions, talk about announcements, or anything else SDCC related in here. This is not intended to be the only place to discuss SDCC news. It's just an easy to use resource for the weekend.

----

EDIT (12:07 CDT): 23 minutes to go. If rumors hold out, there could be a *The Batman* announcement, AND a new BvS trailer, which would likely go online right after showing at SDCC.

EDIT (12:14 CDT): 16 minutes to go. Liveblog of panel at these links: [comingsoon](http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/460789-warner-bros-pictures-comic-con-panel-live-blog) | [batman-news](http://batman-news.com/2015/07/11/batman-v-superman-comic-con-hall-h-live-blog/)

EDIT: (12:21 CDT): 9 minutes to go. [MY BODY IS READY](http://25.media.tumblr.com/a2e60c55b942d6e7510622ba79b586bb/tumblr_mm5jq5rdhn1rei3gfo1_r1_500.gif). Also /u/BarbequeMeat says Suicide Squad footage is 100%, so if not send your hate mail to them.

EDIT (12:27 CDT): 3 minutes to go. Buckle in. This lasts an hour and a half. Get a drink, go pee, get HYPE.

EDIT (12:39 CDT): Small delay at SDCC, stay tuned.

EDIT (12:41 CDT): Okay, they're starting. Man liveblog watching stations!

----

EDIT (12:47 CDT): ~~Only BvS on the panel today. Look for Suicide Squad tomorrow.~~

EDIT (12:51 CDT): They're starting with Man from UNCLE. I would assume BvS is last today.

EDIT (13:05 CDT): Pan is next at SDCC, then BvS. Stay frosty.

EDIT (13:07 CDT): The Man from UNCLE trailer is online, looks good for BvS.

EDIT (13:24 CDT): Here comes BvS!

EDIT (13:28 CDT): GL film to be ""Green Lantern Corps""

Wonder Woman looks fierce, Lex Luthor is pretty menacing, and Bats vs. Supes scenes are so hype. Would love to hear your opinions about it. Let's be respectful, of course.

From the trailer: hints that Red Hood will be in Batman v. Superman?,"In the trailer, there's a quote (I'm paraphrasing) that says, ""How many good guys are left in Gotham? How many stayed good?"" They also feature a spray painted Robin suit, likely that of Jason Todd from when the Joker killed him.

Could this be hinting at Red Hood being a violent force in Gotham that Superman associates with Batman, hence the animosity?",movies,28,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d16b5/from_the_trailer_hints_that_red_hood_will_be_in/,,405freeway,3d16b5,/r/movies/comments/3d16b5/from_the_trailer_hints_that_red_hood_will_be_in/,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d16b5/from_the_trailer_hints_that_red_hood_will_be_in/,25,2015-07-12
Batman v. Superman Kryptonite theory,"So, I hope this theory has not already been stated, because I feel pretty clever having come up with it on my own. After the BvS trailer dropped yesterday I decided to watch MoS again. It was definitely cool to see the scene where Zod uses his heat vision inside that building, causing it to fall especially since the mirror or the exterior shot is seen the the BvS trailer. What stood out to me during the trailer was the shot of Luthor staring lovingly at what I assume is [Kryptonite.](http://i.imgur.com/glsBwk7.png)

Interesting, but where did it come from? Well there is a scene in the trailer where a man is skin diving, and is approaching a oddly shaped [rock thing.](http://i.imgur.com/XkNNfue.png) Could that be Kryptonite? If so, why would it be in the water? 
In MoS, you may recall, the world engine was released in the [South Indian Ocean](http://i.imgur.com/wewyTxC.png) In the scene where it is turned on, Dr. Emil Hamilton says this about the machine, [""It's like some kind of gravity weapon; working in tandem with their ship. Somehow they're increasing the earth's mass, clouding the atmosphere with particulates.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wukyrxavkJo) So, how are they adding mass and, ""changing the topography?"" The world engine is making kryptonite. It was only on for a few minutes, and the damage, though catastrophic, was mostly contained. Thus, the relatively small amount of Kryptonite that Lex is staring at longingly. 

Anyway, that is my half-baked theory. I'd love to hear what you all think.

Let's take a moment to appreciate how great the world building has been,"Because it's been one of my favorite aspects so far. It feels natural and real. Batman v Superman had a Joker tease in it even before they cast a Joker. It also had a Red Hood tease as well, which seems to be the likely Batman solo film. 

Watching the leaked Suicide Squad teaser (which I don't have a link for) even better shows off this world-building with quotes by Amanda Waller.

[Spoilers] Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad theory.,"In the Batman V Superman trailer, we see a Robin costume (presumably Jason Todd's). 
At the end of the Suicide Squad trailer, the Joker says: 
""I'm not going to kill you. Just hurt you really, really badly."" 
This leads me to believe that the scene in the Suicide Squad trailer takes place in a flashback in the movie (Suicide Squad). This flashback shows the death of Jason Todd and sets up future events (Red Hood possibly?).",batman,4,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/3cz3u8/spoilers_batman_v_superman_and_suicide_squad/,,localotaku,3cz3u8,/r/batman/comments/3cz3u8/spoilers_batman_v_superman_and_suicide_squad/,http://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/3cz3u8/spoilers_batman_v_superman_and_suicide_squad/,7,2015-07-12

TIFU by eavesdropping neighbours and looking like a creepy beggar.,"Wow, for the first time in my life, I actually remember a fuck-up of mine. Well, maybe because it was less than 5 minutes ago.

To really understand what just happened, I have to tell you the logistics first. I live on the 20th floor in an apartment complex, and my grandma lives on the 12th. She is 90 years old so it's my responsibility to bring her food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

So around noon today, my mother baked some egg tarts for a casual family Sunday afternoon tea. While she was serving the tarts onto the living room table, I was watching the newest Batman V Superman trailer, so I was busy hyperventilating in my room. As usual, my mom told me to put one of the tarts on a plate and bring it to grandma. So I did. 

As soon as I opened her apartment door on the 12th floor, I see that there was nobody watching TV in the living room, so naturally I assumed she was in her room doing her thing. I put the plate with the egg tart on her dining table and left.

Fast forward 6-7 hours, my family and I were taking the elevator up to the 20th floor after eating dinner outside, when suddenly, my mother suggested I go check on grandma. And to also bring her the take out dinner we bought for her when we were eating out.

Here is where the fuck up begins, I went to grandma's floor and entered her apartment. There I found a really clean plate on top of her dining table, since my grandma always wipes everything and everything clean after eating. So I was happy. She was watching TV in the living room and was smiling at me, well because I was holding her dinner in one hand.

After I got her all settled down in the dining table and said goodnight and all that, I took the clean plate and left her apartment. So, visualize this, I, in rusty and extremely baggy-looking pajamas that I have worn for 4 years, with a plate in one hand, and feet in slippers, I waited for the elevator to come to the 12th floor.

SUDDENLY, I hear this huge ass scream inside one of the neighbours apartment, then an intense argument with loads of curses occurred, which was quickly followed up by a series of glass-smashing sounds. I was scared for a sec, but then I got curious. I walked towards the door and put my ear close to the gap between the door and the wall. So I listened. And listened.

Until ""***BAM***"", someone was slammed against the door, and within milliseconds THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN!!! There I was, in pajamas and looking straight up like a beggar, with a plate in hand, holding intense eye contact with a girl with her hair all messed up, tears streaming down her face, and saliva hanging at the corners of her mouth. She yelled.

I screamed. What. The. Fuck. Is. Going. On. I didn't know, I didn't care, but I heard the elevator sound go off, which meant the elevator has arrived, so I sprinted inside the elevator and went back up. My mom thanked me for checking up on grandma, and I smiled at her and said: ""No problem mom."" 

The end.

TLDR; I eavesdropped whilst looking like a beggar and screamed shortly after.",tifu,1,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3d0djv/tifu_by_eavesdropping_neighbours_and_looking_like/,M,[deleted],3d0djv,/r/tifu/comments/3d0djv/tifu_by_eavesdropping_neighbours_and_looking_like/,http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3d0djv/tifu_by_eavesdropping_neighbours_and_looking_like/,1,2015-07-12

"The new Batman Vs Superman trailer is pushing the ""leader/follower"" paradigm HARD.","poster: **[no1113](/u/no1113)**, [original conspiracy link](/r/conspiracy/comments/3cyimk/the_new_batman_vs_superman_trailer_is_pushing_the/)

-----------------------------------

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WWzgGyAH6Y

And what it's covertly (and not so covertly) saying - especially throughout the first half of the trailer - is ""be the *follower*"".

""Humanity needs a *leader*.""

""Humanity *needs* someone to follow.""

etc, etc. ad nauseam.

That movie pushes hard the idea that we cannot be powerful, independent, self-motivated, autonomous *individuals*.  It pushes hard the idea that the plebs *need* to be led.  They/we *need*/require/*crave* some sort of figurehead to follow...like (yes) sheep.

This is subtle (and, again, not so subtle) programming taking place here.

""Abdicate your self-power and responsibility and follow the appointed leader/ruler in front of you."" is the message.

What's sad is that I've heard this often enough here already - where comments are made by users who talk about any movement not being able to occur or be successful unless there is a ""leader""...and all the while the people who say this never realize that the leader they are looking for and need is looking right back at them right in front of the mirror.

Batman vs Superman - why Batman hates Superman (possible spoilers),"So the newest trailer for BvS was recently shown at comic-con and is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WWzgGyAH6Y) for your viewing pleasure, now on to the theory. 

There is one main reason why Batman would hate Superman, in Man of Steel, Superman and Zod absolutely wrecked and devastated Metropolis and chances are high that the death toll is in the millions. 

Now on to what raised some red flags, it seems very obvious that the scenes with Bruce on the phone looking very distraught is a sort of flashback scene to Man of Steel when Superman was fighting Zod, most notably was [this](http://i.imgur.com/Is77Sfz.png) scene that was in the trailer which was also in Man of Steel which leads me to believe that that whole scene takes place during Sups and Zod fight.

So now that we have established the where and when those scenes are the question is, why? well thats where my theory comes in. It is rumored that there is going a dead Robin from [this](http://i.imgur.com/uED8AJg.jpg) headstone displaying the name Richard Grayson although i cant validate the rumor and the picture. 

The second thing that sparked the theory was [this](http://i.imgur.com/mXsehft.png) scene from the trailer, the writing on the newspaper reads 
&gt; You let your family die 

Other than Alfred and Robin, Bruce has no family (this assuming Robin and Alfred are the only members of the bat-family in the movie) and with Alfred very much alive this only leads me to believe that the ""family"" the writing is referring to is Robin (now as to who knows that Dick was Robin and knew  to send it to Bruce is an entirely unknown point). We also cant forget that Bruce has a now retired Robin suit in the Batcave. 

This also leads to the reoccurring theme in the trailers of Batman crossing the line of hate and anger to kill Superman which is a nice parallel to the comics with Batman unwilling to kill the Joker for the same reasons (killing millions of civilians **and** a Robin) ",FanTheories,1,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3cz4yd/batman_vs_superman_why_batman_hates_superman/,,segalu31,3cz4yd,/r/FanTheories/comments/3cz4yd/batman_vs_superman_why_batman_hates_superman/,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3cz4yd/batman_vs_superman_why_batman_hates_superman/,4,2015-07-12

Watching the Watchmen. . . Superman/Batman,"I was just thinking about Batman and Superman and how in the second volume of superman/batman they realize in every continuity and earth there is some form of batman and superman, which in dc pretty much always holds true. Then I turned on SyFy while watchmen was playing and as I watched I realized that even in this continuity some form of the two exists.  We have the ""god"" Dr Manhattan, and more interestingly we have the many characteristics of batman broken up into several characters.  

Rorschach is the tragic kid broken by the sickness of the world hell bent on fighting it until his last breath.

Nightowl is the hero who wants to do good for the world and fights crime with cool gadgets and toys, but has a human side to him.

Ozymandias is the billionaire genius strategist but lacks the ability to empathize with people, yet feels the need to try and save them.

Mild spoilers
 I think in a way Ozymandias embodies the side of Bruce that he fears the most, the part of him that wants to go to far too cure sickness, but Bruce has the characteristics of Rorschach and Nightowl that ground him and out weigh the drive to go to far. 

My point is, I think it's cool that Alan Moore created these characters that have such unique ideals, and how in a way these ideals define batman thus placing him in this continuity. Idk [4]

My (very early) theory about blond congresswoman from Batman V Superman trailer?,"As DC seems to like to inject politics into their films from time to time (and usually not to positive effect IMO, but I'll withold judgement till I at least see it -- *X-Men: DoFP* did politics well, so it isn't impossible), I'm wondering if the blond Senator might be a Hillary Clinton stand in. And it looks like they're setting her up to be a heel. 

What do you think? Obviously it is way too early to say this conclusively, but does the speculation at least make sense? And if she is Clinton stand in and also a heel, do you think that move will work (again, I'm not optimistic)?",movies,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d6i9c/my_very_early_theory_about_blond_congresswoman/,,SeanCanary,3d6i9c,/r/movies/comments/3d6i9c/my_very_early_theory_about_blond_congresswoman/,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d6i9c/my_very_early_theory_about_blond_congresswoman/,7,2015-07-13

BM vs SM Robin fan input,"So being a fan of Robin (yea its weird) and seeing the costume in the new trailer I thought about how cool it would be if a Robin showed up in the new movie.  While I couldn't think of a way for Tim Drake (my favorite) to actually make an appearance I did come up with this.

Either when Batman goes to his lair or when he turns on the signal we hear a voice.

NW: I was wondering how long it would take you to get involved.

BM: I must have trained you well.  I didn't even hear you come up on me.

NW: I wasn't trying to sneak up on you, you have been out of the game for a while.  You may think about finding yourself a partner.

BM: You busy?

NW: I am not getting involved in this! Maybe you will make a new friend.

BM: Aren't we still friends?

BM turns and sees no one there.

BM: so that's what that feels like.

I know this joke has been done before but the movie seems pretty serious so implementing a joke may be a good move.  Also I like Robin.  This includes Nightwing.

http://comicbook.com/2015/07/11/robin-costume-spotted-in-batman-v-superman-trailer/

Picture of the scene in the trailer I was talking about.

Anyway I really just wanted to get my thoughts down and get some feedback from other fans of movies and comics. 

Also I am interested to see if anyone else can come up with an idea of getting one of the Robins in the movie or what they would like to see in the new film.",movies,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d32am/bm_vs_sm_robin_fan_input/,Discussion,thatguy411,3d32am,/r/movies/comments/3d32am/bm_vs_sm_robin_fan_input/,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d32am/bm_vs_sm_robin_fan_input/,6,2015-07-13
Batman v Superman Discussion:,"Ok guys the trailer for Batman v Superman was phenomenal, but I'm very hesitant about this film because of Man of Steel. I loved Man of Steel but I can be honest and say that the plot was awful, also man of steel had my favorite trailer of all time. 

First off, BvS looks visually stunning, Affleck makes a cool Bruce Wayne and the suit looks amazing, Gal Gadot look awesome as Wonder Woman a character I didn't think could be done, and Eisenberg look maniacal and manipulative. 
I'm hoping writer Chris Terrio can deliver a fantastic story and I also really like the Easter eggs as well! 

Concerns, even as amazing as this trailer is, the film looks like it has a lot of action, on par with man of steel which I believe hurt the film. Some parts also look out of place, for example batman in the desert although cool, it looks different from the rest of the scenes in the trailer. One more thing is that I believe the final action sequence will be a cgi fest and I'm nervous about this one because sometimes poor cgi really takes me out of place.

So guys this is the movie I'm looking foreword to the most, and I can't wait! Good or bad I'm sure I'm going to like it. But what do you guys think? 

Who do you think all three of them will be battling at the end? Do you Holly Hunter's role is more than just a senator? This is the movie that launches the DC franchise, do you think it will succeed and why? Lastly what do you guys want to see from this film, in terms of characters, scene, and endings?",movies,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d3dgy/batman_v_superman_discussion/,,NightcrawlerKing,3d3dgy,/r/movies/comments/3d3dgy/batman_v_superman_discussion/,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d3dgy/batman_v_superman_discussion/,10,2015-07-13

"[MOVIE] [Theory] What if ""Suicide Squad""'s Joker IS Jason Todd?","
However, after reading some comments on the new Suicide Squad trailer, this theory came to me. 


I remember one movie/tv animation of the Joker returning and being the old Robin who had leftover ""damage"" left dormant for many years after the Joker once capturing and attacking/torturing him.  

In the comics, Jason Todd comes back to life as the messed up Red Hood. 

OK. Here is my theory:

 What if in the history new DC movie universe, the original Joker had captured and broken down Jason Todd, tortured him, painted him with a bunch of stupid 'Jokery' clown, haha, tattoos and even wrote ""Damaged"" on his forehead to write down what he had done to the boy. 


This Jason Todd later becomes the Joker, and does the same thing(s) to Harley Quinn. This is the type of thing that unfortunately happens all the time in real life. Bad things happen to people, they grow up and continue the pattern and do those things to other people, themselves: 

We see Harley Quinn in the trailer with tattoos on her face and body in the similar style to the Jokers. 

The trailer even shows her as a doctor being attacked in a lab, and the it ends with the Joker promising to hurt someone, presumably Harley before she became Harley. 

The Superman V Batman trailer definitely confirms that something happened to Robin by showing Bruce Wayne looking at what Joker did the Robin's costume. 


We all know that this [Ben Affleck] Batman is relatively old and past his prime. The Joker, here, however, seems quite young. (Jared Leto is especially known for how young he looks). 
 

What if this Joker is really the creation of the last Joker?

[BvS] All that kneeling in the trailer explained,"After seeing a lot of fan theories on here about the Batman/Joker side of things I rewatched the trailer and thought of something on Superman And Lex Luthor. Be aware that this is only a fan theory however, I feel like it makes a lot of sense. For this theory I will be using the Comic-Con trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WWzgGyAH6Y

After the events of Man of Steel, Superman is called before the Senate (0:08-0:24) to stand trial for his crimes and destruction ("" this comitee holds him responsible"" (0:45). 

But the Senator is in Lex Luthor's pocket which I get from her visiting him (1:48) and we know that he has Kryptonite (2:48). We also see Superman angrily kneeling to Luthor (1:55), it is very likely the kryptonite has been used on him. 

Later we see soldiers with Superman ""S"" patches kneeling to Superman in what looks like some desert bunker (2:05), we later see Batman leave a very similar bunker and the S-patched soldiers shooting civilians and fighting the Batman (2:38-2:40). 

And finally, near the end Luthor says over and over again ""the red capes are coming"" (3:10).

My theory is this: The people kneeling to Supes are the aforementioned ""Red Capes"", an elite military force created by the US Government with help from Luthor. Luthor meets with the Senator to discuss this idea and together they use Superman's guilt over the events in Man of Steel and Luthor's kryptonite to force Supes to work with the Red Capes, hence the kneeling to Luthor. Because the US is the US they send the Red Capes and Supes to some Middle Eastern country to battle some ""terrorist threat"" (of course the real reason is one of Luthor's evil plans). Batman, hating Supes for destroying a bunch of stuff and for using his powers for evil (Luthor's plan), goes to said country to fight Supes and gets beat by the Red Capes so he heads back to Gotham to take Supes on his home-turf.

I know this is a bit convoluted but I honestly thinks it makes a lot of sense. And I know there is a lot more in the trailer, I'm especially intrigued by the implication that Batman and WW have been working behind the scenes for a long time and Jeremy Irons' ""He is not our enemy"".

[BvS/Suicide Squad/] Who the note on the news paper is from.,"This theory will be focussing on who the ""You let your family die"" note on the news paper in the Batman v. Superman Comic Con trailer. I'll be using evidence from the BvS trailer, the Suicide Squad trailer, and Batman:Arkham Knight

Let's start with the BvS trailer

0:52- A man in a green coat with grey and black hair is shown walking towards a tattered Wayne Manor

0:56- We see a news paper with the head line ""Wayne Tower Devastated"" most likely referring to the Wayne Tower we see destroyed in the Superman/Zod fight earlier in the trailer. Scrawled on the paper in red ink are the words ""YOU LET YOUR FAMILY DIE"" 

2:02- We see a shrine to Jason Todd's Robin, complete with his outfit vandalized with yellow paint saying ""HAHAHAH Joke's on you BATMAN""

2:10-2:15- Batman dressed in a robotic batsuit uncovers the obviously long since used bat signal.

Now for Suicide Squad

In the trailer we see Joker in what looks like some sort of torture chamber from which he says ""Oh, I'm not gunna kill you. I'm just going to hurt you, really, really bad""

The song ""I Started a Joke"" by the Bee Gees playing throughout the trailer.

Arkham Knight

In a hallucinatory flash back Joker says ""I'm not gunna kill you, not yet anyways"" which is eerily similar to what Leto's Joker says in the trailer.

Analyzation

When I think ""Green cloak + salt and pepper hair + DC universe"" my mind immediately jumps to Ras Al Ghul. As I'm sure many of you know Ras' daughter Talia brings Jason Todd back to life using the Lazarus Pit after he is killed by the Joker. Warner Bros. seems to have a very interesting fascination with Todd as of late based on the ""twist"" in Arkham Knight and the heavy handed Robin imagery in the BvS trailer. The news paper is tricky because it seems to not come from Bruce, who blames himself for letting his parents die. The key here is that he ""let his family die"", not just his parents. The message refers to Jason Todd but that doesn't tell us who it's from, just who it's about. Some have speculated Joker, but we can infer this isn't the case using the Robin shrine. First of all the handwriting isn't the same and second of all they're written through different emotions. The note is written through anger, hate, using all capital letters and jagged straight lines. The costume is written on playfully, teasing Batman that he lost. Both the robotic suit and the bat symbol are a reference to the comic series ""The Dark Knight Returns"" in which Batman comes out of retirement and eventually fights Superman. He also rescues Carrie Kelly, who petitions to be come the new Robin. There are mixed feelings though as Batman and Alfred are still shook up over the death of Jason Todd. Due to the similarities between Leto's quote in the trailer and the quote from Joker as he's torturing Todd we can assume Leto is also torturing Todd. The song in the SS trailer references a joke, as does the Robin outfit, the question is, what joke? The Killing Joke. Joker's origin story, in which it's revealed Joker was originally a gang member know as The Red Hood, a moniker later used by Jason Todd. Based on all this, I propose the letter on the newspaper is from Jason Todd, the Red Hood. The news paper was attacking Bruce Wayne, not Batman, Jason Todd's adopted father. His family, who let Todd die. Red, jagged letters written out of anger and hate at Bruce, written by Jason Todd.",FanTheories,15,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3d9wep/bvssuicide_squad_who_the_note_on_the_news_paper/,,Odinist9,3d9wep,/r/FanTheories/comments/3d9wep/bvssuicide_squad_who_the_note_on_the_news_paper/,http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3d9wep/bvssuicide_squad_who_the_note_on_the_news_paper/,16,2015-07-14

Dear Verge: please stop reporting about DC films unless you're ready to stop being stupid about it.,"http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/12/8936595/sdcc-2015-day-3-batman-v-superman-suicide-squad-deadpool-warcraft

Seriously? Batman v. Superman didn't stir up interest? It was a top trend on Facebook and Twitter for 2 days straight, until Arrow, Deadpool and Suicide Squad got more exposure. The hype was ridiculously high for that film. I've seen more sites discuss *that* in-depth than the Deadpool trailer, until Deadpool was properly released online.
Edit: Twitter released the statistic, the biggest spike in traffic came with the release of the Batman v. Superman trailer, and that's while going against The Hunger Games and Star Wars. 

Then there's this headline (http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/11/8933549/batman-vs-superman-trailer-comic-con-2015) which doesn't even match the tone of the article which (shockingly to me) praises WB's comic con set and the trailer. Also, remind me what city gets leveled during the trailer? All of the fight sequences (save for Bizarro/Doomsday/Zod Zombie lasering Batman) take place outside of the cities. Superman's over a burning forest, Wonder Woman's out in some scrap yard.  Batman and Superman is the only one in the city and they're fighting in an abandoned, derelict warehouse.

Do you guys legitimately just dislike DC? Because if I remember correctly you also had an article going on and on about how Zack Snyder ruined the Batmobile with the guns, despite the fact that almost every Batmobile since the 80's has had guns. Not to mention the Burton and Nolan films, which you tried (and hilariously failed) to do a comparison of.  EDIT: Not only that, when the comments decided to point out how wrong you were, you didn't straight up admit or retract your error, you just sort of admitted that there may be people with different opinions than yours, even though it's less an opinion and a fact. And you downplayed how badly you screwed up. 

Other sites are hunting down Easter Eggs and screen grabs to analyzing and inform people about the films while you guys are pulling this kind of shit. 

Also, ""not-terrible"" is how you described Leto? Everyone else has been using the word ""terrifying"" and praising him. I realize a lot of other sites took the easy route of ragging on DC for being serious unlike Marvel but you have to realize that trend has been dying down. Now you just look stupid. 

And FYI, I realize you won't care, but Superman didn't knock down any building of Wayne's. He thinks he did, but if you watch the trailer, those heat beams come from Zod...you know, the villain of the first movie who destroyed several blocks of Metropolis but Superman gets scapegoated for it? If you think I'm pulling this out of my ass, a guy literally lined up two gifs to prove it. 

Shoddy f*cking reporting there, guys.

TIFU by smoking pot and driving.,"This happened today around 11AM EST.

Today I woke up and decided to wake and bake. I smoked while re-watching the Batman v Superman trailer for the millionth time.

I smoked a few bowls and got blasted.

Once I finished, I had to go to the grocery store and get gas. I went to get gas first. I paid $30 for the gas and left, I went to the grocery store, got what I needed, and went home.

When I got home is when I saw my gas tank was in E. It is then when I realized I was so high I paid for the gas but forgot to actually filled up my tank.

So, I go back to the gas station, and there's already a car there at the spot I was intentially going to pump gas in. Who knows how many cars came before that one. Oh, well. Today I paid $60 on gas for a Toyota Corolla.

**TL;DR:** They lie, smoking and driving is indeed dangerous...

Suicide Squad and Batman V. Superman link,"I don't know if somebody already posted it here. But has anyone noticed a link between the Batman V. Superman and Suicide Squad trailers? 

In Suicide Squad the trailer goes with the music ""I started a Joke"" from Bee Gees. The lyrics goes like that:

""I started a joke
Wich started the whole world crying
But i didn't see 
that the joke was on me""

And in BvS we can see an old Robin suit with a message from joker
That says ""HAHAHA jokes is on you, Batman""

I can see a link there. Maybe on the scene of the trailer the Joker was torturing Robin (Jason Todd, maybe? A clear reference to""A death in the Family). Wich make me believe that the events of suicide squad will happen before BvS.

Footage screened at Comic-Con's Hall H: What should change?,"This year saw a *bunch* of leaks from SDCC's Hall H find their way to the internet, as well as Warner Bros. releasing the Suicide Squad trailer officially after the bootleg version was uploaded. They also released the Batman v Superman Comic-Con footage online as well, uploading arguably their most anticipated movie footage of the panel for those beyond the walls of Hall H to see. I've never seen a studio release their main Hall H attraction online straight after a panel, and I've also never seen a studio officially release a Comic-Con trailer due to it leaking until this year (I commend Warner Bros for doing both). Footage used to be something only meant for those in Hall H, but it's clearly becoming somewhat unrealistic to expect nothing to leak. So my question is, how should footage screened at Comic-Con be handled in the upcoming years? Should they completely ban electronics from Hall H? Or should they perhaps stream their panels, along with their footage, to prevent leaks?

Please explain what you know about the DC movie universe,"Essentially, I'm trying to figure out how they are setting it up.  I assume that they are considering the Nolan Batman's to be their own separate, ""bubble"" universe, although I could be wrong.

Based off the trailer for Suicide Squad, the mentioning of Superman has me believing that it will be a part of the Man of Steel/Batman V Superman universe.

Will they be starting over the Green Lantern story (the Ryan Reynolds version wasn't well received from what I understand) with the new movie?

I know they are setting up for an eventual Justice League movie to rival the Avengers, just trying to get a handle on what they consider to be the start of this universe (my assumption is Man of Steel) and what all characters will be involved, and to what degrees.

Also, my guess is that DC TV shows such as Flash and Arrow are considered separate entities and will not have any relation to the movie universe, which I think is a bit of a shame after they tied Daredevil into the Marvel movie universe, although I don't think the CW shows would really fit well.",movies,1,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d6zv6/please_explain_what_you_know_about_the_dc_movie/,Discussion,crimsonburn27,3d6zv6,/r/movies/comments/3d6zv6/please_explain_what_you_know_about_the_dc_movie/,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3d6zv6/please_explain_what_you_know_about_the_dc_movie/,14,2015-07-14

Regarding Doomsday in BVS,"Tinfoil hat Batman V Superman theory: since Man of Steel reused a villain from one of the Reeves movies, General Zod, perhaps the appearance of Lex Luthor may hint that he used Kryptonian DNA to recreate another Reeves villain: Nuclear Man. This could explain why there is a very powerful looking heat vision strike towards Batman that would have killed him, and it also explains Luthor's line ""The red capes are coming!"" The red capes are coming!"". With the fairly recent Doomsday reports/rumors, I feel like the origin that was hinted at (Zod's DNA manipulated by Lex) sounds much more like the (admittedly terrible) villain origin from Superman IV: Quest for Peace.

[X-post from /r/comicbooks] A Movie universe theory for the Joker and his new look.,"However, after reading some comments on the new Suicide Squad trailer, this theory came to me.

I remember one movie/tv animation of the Joker returning and being the old Robin who had leftover ""damage"" left dormant for many years after the Joker once capturing and attacking/torturing him.

In the comics, Jason Todd comes back to life as the messed up Red Hood.

OK. Here is my theory:

What if in the history new DC movie universe, the original Joker had captured and broken down Jason Todd, tortured him, painted him with a bunch of stupid 'Jokery' clown, haha, tattoos and even wrote ""Damaged"" on his forehead to write down what he had done to the boy.

This Jason Todd later becomes the Joker, and does the same thing(s) to Harley Quinn. This is the type of thing that unfortunately happens all the time in real life. Bad things happen to people, they grow up and continue the pattern and do those things to other people, themselves:

We see Harley Quinn in the trailer with tattoos on her face and body in the similar style to the Jokers.

The trailer even shows her as a doctor being attacked in a lab, and the it ends with the Joker promising to hurt someone, presumably Harley before she became Harley.

The Superman V Batman trailer definitely confirms that something happened to Robin by showing Bruce Wayne looking at what Joker did the Robin's costume.

We all know that this [Ben Affleck] Batman is relatively old and past his prime. The Joker, here, however, seems quite young. (Jared Leto is especially known for how young he looks).

What if this Joker is really the creation of the last Joker?",batman,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/3d8227/xpost_from_rcomicbooks_a_movie_universe_theory/,,[deleted],3d8227,/r/batman/comments/3d8227/xpost_from_rcomicbooks_a_movie_universe_theory/,http://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/3d8227/xpost_from_rcomicbooks_a_movie_universe_theory/,0,2015-07-14

Today Batman got hold of me...,"Hi, PCMR I'm sadly to announce that I bought Batman: Arkham Knight via G2A today, before starting swearing on me, please listen my story.

It all started with Batman v Superman CC trailer. I watched the trailer via youtube and while browsing 9GAG, I read that the funny looking Batman sigil comes from ""The Dark Knight Returns"" series. I've never watched or read those comics before, so I downloaded them. After watching part 1, I've felt changed, like something is taking me over. I've played all of the Arkham Games (except Origins) and I love all of it. I wanted to play AK but since it's port issues, I've figured, ""nah I'm not gonna buy it for now"" but after watching ""The Dark Knight Returns Part 1"", [This](http://imgur.com/NgEONc3) happened. I lost my control to my inner Batman, and bought the game, now I'm waiting for it finishes it's download. I'm not asking for forgiveness, but I'm asking for your mercy.

"I hope Marvel learns from WB and stops this whole ""exclusive"" trailer stuff","So D23 is coming up and Disney and Marvel are rumored to show the first trailer for Civil War. This past weekend comic-con happened and lots of leaked trailers have been appearing online. 

WB intially only released the Batman V Superman trailer but tried to keep suicide squad comic-con exlusive for as long as they could but eventually caved in and released it in HD as well. 

I hope Marvel learns from this and realizes that its better to release the trailer officially rather than have people watch it in crappy cam quality since its going to leak anyway especially at d23 where the security isnt as tight as comic-con. 

Studios need to stop with this exclusitivity bullshit. Hopefully Marvel learned from this years comic-con and wont repeat the same mistake as WB.

Dick Grayson is THE JOKER!,"Well, at least in the Dark Knight Strikes again HE IS! That got me thinking that Dick Grayson might also be the joker in the upcoming Batman v Superman movie too since the whole movie is kind of based on The Dark Knight. For those who don't know Dick IS the joker in the sequel of The Dark Knight comic- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Strikes_Again

In the trailer we hear Bruce said ""twenty years in Gotham, how many good guy are left, how many stayed that way "", and then a reference to the Robin suit with the R logo that is different from Dick's so it has to be either Jason or Tim or Carrie (I vote for Jason tho). So there might be chances that DICK IS THE NEW JOKER!

Let me know what you guys think :)

What happens if Batman v Superman gets the same polarizing reaction as Man of Steel?,"Realistically speaking, that would be two major strikes in a row on WB/DC's part, and I've noticed there are a lot of people who didn't like Man of Steel, who are willing to let that movie slide in favor of being excited for this one. But I can't imagine people having any excitement or confidence in Wonder Woman and Justice League, if they fail to hit that mark with Batman v Superman. Especially considering this movie is a bit of a holy grail for comic book movies.

So what do you see happening in this scenario? I personally can't see them scrapping the entire DCCU Universe all together, however to me the best course of action would be to give Snyder the boot and bring a different and proven director.",movies,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3daemg/what_happens_if_batman_v_superman_gets_the_same/,,Snark88,3daemg,/r/movies/comments/3daemg/what_happens_if_batman_v_superman_gets_the_same/,http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3daemg/what_happens_if_batman_v_superman_gets_the_same/,19,2015-07-14

"For the Comics-Naive: Flash vs. Arrow (Season 1, Episode 8)(Warning: SPOILERS)","Greetings, fellow Flash fanatics! Happy Tuesday, and welcome to another FTCN recap! This week, we learn the color of anger, and a few more emotions. Let‚Äôs get started.

________________________________

* The villain-of-the-week today is **Roy G. Bivolo ([GET IT?!?](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Bad-Joke-Eel.jpg))**. Cisco gives him the fitting name *Prism*, but his comic book incarnation uses the name Caitlin assigned him: [**Rainbow Raider**](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091029030054/marvel_dc/images/0/07/Rainbow_Raider_001.jpg). On a side note, that moment was one of my favorite parts of the episode. Anyway, in the comics, Bivolo was a [young artistic genius](http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/flashrogues19a.jpg). However, he was also colorblind. His optometrist genius father, wanting to help his son achieve his dreams, developed a set of goggles to help him see in color. After his father died, [Bivolo received the goggles](http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/flashrogues19b.jpg). However, rather than fixing his vision, they gave him the ability to produce and [project solid beams of visible light](http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/flashrogues19c-620x922.jpg). And if that sounds familiar, I‚Äôll get to that. Anyway, he pretty quickly turned to crime (apparently, the art world didn‚Äôt like his black-and-white artwork [which](https://deborahj.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/mcescher.jpg) [makes](http://www.bocamuseum.org/clientuploads/EXHIBITION_IMAGES/Escher.HandSphereLR.jpg) [no](http://www.markwk.com/teaching/lessons/quino-picasso-%20guernica/images/guernica_all.jpg) [sense](http://newabstraction.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/milliners-copy.jpg) [when](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Kazimir_Malevich_-_%27Suprematist_Composition-_White_on_White%27%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_1918%2C_Museum_of_Modern_Art.jpg) [all](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Justso_crabplay.jpg) [of](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Salvador_Dali_A_(Dali_Atomicus)_09633u.jpg) [these](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/21/article-2206050-0059AA091000044C-332_964x756.jpg) [exist](https://engl328.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/cri_1792921.jpg), but OK), and used his goggles to rob art galleries (with the whole ‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt appreciate it, no one can‚Äù kinda thing going). He‚Äôd do this by [riding on a rainbow](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091029030054/marvel_dc/images/0/07/Rainbow_Raider_001.jpg) (during which, he presumably sang [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=844DzynPG-w)[)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX0D4oZwCsA), and blasting those that got in his way with various color beams. Each color of the visible light spectrum, when shot from Bivolo‚Äôs goggles, induced a specific emotion in those bathed by the light. In the episode, we see red symbolizing anger. In the comics originally, [red induced love or anger](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v189/Munchface/Art/RainbowRaider1-1.jpg), orange induced curiosity, yellow caused joy (or fear, due to writer inconsistency), green caused jealousy, blue caused sadness, indigo caused fear, and violet caused wisdom. I have a theory about how the show will (or *should* handle this, but I‚Äôll get to that later). He also had the ability to drain color from objects and people, making them‚Ä¶tired. Yeah, not sure how that works. He was a frequent [villain of the Flash](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e2/62/5e/e2625e76ff75d631ebc05ea6757bf313.jpg), and later [Booster Gold](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_large/0/4/25554-3596-28402-1-booster-gold.jpg). That said, though, his reputation changed considerably over the years. Having debuted in the Bronze Age, he was originally taken seriously. But, when you have a villain named Rainbow Raider surfing on a rainbow, [he‚Äôs not gonna be taken](http://static.tumblr.com/b68fb6f62f810f1815b44a0d3a4b4472/qscpzxb/iP3mlfyk7/tumblr_static_believesmall2.png) [seriously for long](https://p.dreamwidth.org/cab87ef28861/-/ic.pics.livejournal.com/icon_uk/11800056/1653157/1653157_original.jpg), despite his formidable power set. Then, during the‚Ä¶interesting‚Ä¶storyline *Underworld Unleashed*, he was badly wronged by fellow Flash villain, [the Trickster](http://img32.photobucket.com/albums/v96/ratcreature/rainbow_raider.jpg). Trickster‚Äôs actions resulted in [Bivolo‚Äôs death](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_pAk6DChv218/TH_gyn5PYpI/AAAAAAAAA4s/P0SdTT3U1Mc/s1600/rainbowraiderripped.jpg) at the hands of another Flash villain, Blacksmith. He later came back as a member of the [zombie Black Lantern Corps](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120224184203/marvel_dc/images/thumb/f/f2/Rainbow_Raider_Black_Lantern_Corps_001.jpg/500px-Rainbow_Raider_Black_Lantern_Corps_001.jpg), during DC‚Äôs massive event *Blackest Night*. And that event also has to do with my theory, but I‚Äôll get to that later.

* Eddie is upholding a great tradition in superhero fiction: the prosecution of the hero by the cops. This trope is also known as the [Hero with Bad Publicity](https://annihilusssl.sslcs.cdngc.net/k/0811/0562/29712.jpg?h=60547e9f59b7a05df902d35dbf3f0035&amp;width=640). The two most common sufferers are Marvel‚Äôs [Spider-Man](http://www.spidervillain.com/SpiderManCovers/Amazing/ASM172/Page3.jpg) and DC‚Äôs [Batman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3Tap-e5JLc). However, this is an *extremely* common trope in comic books. In Marvel, sufferers of bad publicity have included the [X-Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfEOlFVSYcA) (and all mutants, for that matter), [Hulk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI9i-FbO4M4), [Captain America](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_large/11/117763/3074350-captainamerica170.jpg) (yes, Captain America), the [Avengers](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20081215220748/marveldatabase/images/8/87/Civil_War_Fight.jpg), [S.H.I.E.L.D.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOnOuTCYElY), [Daredevil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5HvK6Z_cC4) and‚Ä¶really most of Marvel‚Äôs superheroes, especially those based in the United States. On the DC side, we‚Äôve got [Superman](http://wac.450f.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/comicsalliance.com/files/2011/09/actioncomics-1-page-9134138.jpg) (yes, [Superman](https://youtu.be/rwzS3f-Jys4?t=197)), [Batman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-WT5-NEnzY)‚Ä¶uhh‚Ä¶the‚Ä¶[the Creeper](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rbdbdfgvvqo/Tn8zogl-PjI/AAAAAAAAAho/v8JRmcLO6f8/s1600/Showcase73.jpg), and‚Ä¶actually, yeah. Damn. There really aren‚Äôt that many DC heroes with notably bad publicity. Yeah, various heroes have looked bad occasionally, but none have had long-standing bad reputations, at least not until the New 52. This, I suppose, has to do with the differing philosophies and ideologies between DC and Marvel. Granted, in the DCTV universe, both Arrow and Flash have suffered from this, alongside Black Canary and Huntress (although she deserved it). And in those cases, 75% of them were actual murderers.
 
* This episode continues the great comic book tradition of the **superhero team-up**. In DC Comics, there are two books that help to represent this tradition. The first is *The Brave and the Bold*, a book that (especially after issue #50) traditionally starred any two superheroes teaming up to fight a common enemy. A landmark series, it introduced the Justice League, the Teen Titans, and various other classic team-ups. A part of many of these team-ups was Batman, due to the popularity of his television series at the time. This would later inspire the 2008 animated series, *Batman: The Brave and the Bold*, a light-hearted send-up to the Silver Age of Comics which happens to be one of my personal favorite comic book series (mostly because of all of the references, which I am obviously all about). The other major team-up series was *World‚Äôs Finest*, which debuted starring Superman, Batman, and Robin. So why do I bring this up? Because it starred a superpowered character in bright colors teaming up with a non-powered character in darker colors. Sound familiar?

* When we first see the *Arrow team*, we see them eating **Big Belly Burger**. And, yes, this IS a fast food chain found in the comics. Owned by LexCorp, Big Belly Burger started in Coast City, California, and spread to several other major cities in the DC Universe. And, no, it goes no further than that. They‚Äôre not somehow evil or sinister, they don‚Äôt serve as the headquarters for a hero or villain, they‚Äôre just‚Ä¶a burger place. Nothing more. Nice little touch by the writers of *Arrow*, where the chain originated in the DCTV universe.

* The **boomerang** brought in by the *Arrow* team is the weapon of **Digger Harkness**, AKA **Captain Boomerang**. We unfortunately won‚Äôt see him in the series this season, although he does appear in the accompanying episode of *Arrow*. So, since we won‚Äôt see him in this season, I‚Äôll talk about him here. George ‚ÄúDigger‚Äù Harkness grew up in Australia, falling in love with the ancient Aboriginal weapon called the boomerang. As a child, he taught himself to use them, and eventually became a renowned thrower on boomerangs. He was hired as a young adult by [a toy company](http://st.speedforce.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/flash7-boomerang-classic.jpg) to promote their product as their mascot, ‚ÄúCaptain Boomerang.‚Äù Look at that costume for a second. Do you think this went over well with audiences? Well, he was publicly mocked, so no. He turned against the public and used his skills for crime, whilst keeping his already established alias. With his weapons and very specific gimmick, he became a fairly notable [enemy of the Flash]() and member of the Rogues. His boomerangs were often very specific, including explosive boomerangs (like those seen in the *Arrow* episode), razor-sharp boomerangs, and (at least once) a giant remote-controlled boomerang to which he tied the Flash. Man, I love the Silver Age. He later became a notable (if mostly ineffective) member of the Suicide Squad. He was also, by far, the least likeable member. With violent, aggressive, racist, cowardly, and just plain irritating tendencies, he was a major jerk and disliked by everyone on the team. He was so irritating that Amanda Waller, the supervisor of the team, once dropped him out of a helicopter onto a deserted island. He later redeemed himself in the eyes of readers years later, when it was revealed that he was a father to Owen Mercer, a metahuman and the second Captain Boomerang. That said, he ended up (and this is a ***SPOILER***, so heads up) being killed by Jack Drake, the father of Tim Drake (the third Robin) due to the manipulations of Jean Loring during the controversial story *Identity Crisis*. Yet another thing I hated about that story. He got better, though. He becomes a very important part of the story *Brightest Day*, and ends up gaining the ability to generate boomerangs made of energy. He eventually lost these abilities, and his entire history was rewritten by the New 52 reboot. Well, mostly. Honestly, not a whole lot changed about him. As far as I can tell his son no longer exists, but he‚Äôs a member of the new Suicide Squad, so not much has changed.

* The nature of Bivolo‚Äôs powers is based around *color psychology*, which brings me to my theory. I think Bivolo‚Äôs powers are (or at least SHOULD be) based on the **Emotional Spectrum**, a major staple of DC Comics. Now, color-based emotion induction is a part of Bivolo‚Äôs powers in the comics, but I have a reason for believing/hoping my theory is true. We‚Äôve had, and will continue to have, hints that Green Lantern exists in this universe. And the Green Lantern Corps, alongside all of the other Lantern Corps, operate off of the Emotional Spectrum. Every color in the traditional seven-color visible light spectrum (although, scientifically speaking, there are really only 6) is associated with an emotion. Each color Corps must harness that emotion in order to use their rings. Starting from the top: the **Red Lantern Corps** operates off of rage. The Orange Lantern (there‚Äôs only one), Larfleeze, operates off of [avarice and greed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRIbxMT3yak). The Yellow Lanterns, led by former Green Lantern Sinestro, operates off of fear. The Green Lanterns use willpower. The Blue Lanterns use hope (and are basically useless without a Green Lantern nearby; you can‚Äôt have do anything with hope unless you have will). The Indigo Lanterns are powered by compassion. And finally, the Violet Lanterns, AKA the Star Sapphires, are powered by love. And THAT is the emotional spectrum. I would be super happy if the next season (or even the season after) touched on this spectrum, and hopefully introduced the Green Lantern of Earth in the process.

* And we see yet another staple of superhero fiction: the allies fight. This is a long and major staple of superhero fiction. Whilst it takes [m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx6l39BR_FM)[a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQYmDcNCGKs)[n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q-cBN2iK5w)[y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkFzXkpjXmM), [M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phnXMWvHtzQ)[A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BJ1-trrgqc)[N](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O617ZHcazwA)[Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf67nBe_SLo) [f](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1g-B8BJzwc)[o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vcgv9IzRV9M)[r](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=advsN-DfY2k)[m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjx-02XWuzk)[s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKlfg6b-KiU) (and yes, a LOT of those featured the Hulk), this episode has given us a specific brand: the powered vs. the non-powered. This has happened in various forms in various media, most notably and recently between [Batman and Superman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WWzgGyAH6Y) (in a movie I desperately want to like, but know deep down that I won‚Äôt). The usual way these fights go is that the powered individual appears to have the obvious advantage, and then SURPRISE! The non-powered ([or](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8LDhrG89MA) [just](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fGmVHxe0vs) [less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82zGlvPI67w) [powerful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXF4s0wXoTk)) hero planned ahead, and surprisingly defeats (or at least matches) the powered hero. Additionally, the inciting incident is usually one of a few: one superhero is mind-controlled, or one is out of control, or it‚Äôs a simple case of misunderstanding between the heroes. You sometimes get a fairly unique case, like [one hero is wanted by a corrupt government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC1jOsXrE-Y), [whilst the other is working for said corrupt government](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju_h9KUju4w). But these are fairly few and far between. Like we saw in this episode, it‚Äôs usually either some kind of ‚Äúwhammy‚Äù or a misunderstanding. Still, it makes for some fun fights, [doesn‚Äôt it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsT4ttX9scU)?

* And now, we get to a part of the *Arrow* canon. The **woman at the end of the episode** appears to share a past with Oliver. She also speaks to what appears to be her child on the phone. And to fully understand this, we need to talk about *Arrow* a bit more. In the second season, it‚Äôs revealed that Ollie had a relationship with a young woman in 2007, whilst cheating on his girlfriend at the time, Laurel Lance (we‚Äôll also get to her in a later episode). Before cheating on her with her sister Sarah. Yeah, pre-*Arrow* Ollie was a bit of a‚Ä¶disreputable gentleman. Anyway, this woman, whose name is never revealed, ends up getting pregnant. She tells Ollie, who tells his mother, Moira Queen. And Moira, at the time, was also‚Ä¶less than a good person. So, Moira bribes the unnamed woman with $1,000,000, telling her to leave Starling City with her child, to move to Central City, and to tell Oliver that she lost the baby. Whilst she was reluctant to do so, she eventually complied. She left and never spoke to Oliver again, and he has been under the impression that his child is dead. And now, we see her talking to her child over the phone. Huh. Why is *any of this * important? Because this child, the son of Oliver Queen, is very likely named **[Connor Hawke]()**, with his mother being named Sandra. In the comics, Sandra and Oliver were a brief couple in college, and Sandra ended up getting pregnant. Oliver, being a spoiled rich kid (like in the show), offered to pay Sandra to disappear. Yeah, the showwriters wisely made Oliver‚Äôs *mother* the bad guy instead of Oliver. Because that‚Äôs a hard act to forgive. Either way, Oliver didn‚Äôt really see Connor again until several years later. He had actually found them on the day Connor was born (post-island), and set up an account to support the two of them, but wasn‚Äôt there for Connor as a father. When Oliver disappeared, Connor took up his father‚Äôs legacy and became the new Green Arrow. Then Oliver came back, and Connor‚Ä¶stayed as the Green Arrow. Yeah. Weird. Now, are we going to see this in the DCTV universe? Well, probably not, as Connor (if this child *is* Connor) would only be 7 at the time of this episode. However, we *are* in a universe where time travel exists. AND, at the recent San Diego Comic-Con (spoilers for next season coming up), it was revealed that Wally West will appear. And Wally West‚Ä¶you know what? Hold on.

* That‚Äôs better. Now, **Wally West.** This is NOT about the episode. No, this is about the future. Possibly literally. At the SDCC this past Saturday, it was revealed that Wally West would appear in Season 2. But how is that possible? Well, I have a theory. I‚Äôm willing to bet that time travel is involved. In the comics, Wally West is originally known as **Kid Flash**, the sidekick to Barry Allen. He‚Äôs also the nephew of Iris West. After Barry Allen dies during *Crisis on Infinite Earths*, West becomes the third Flash. And this is where my theory comes in. I think that, at some point, Barry ends up going into the future (hopefully using the Treadmill) and meeting his successor. It‚Äôs also possible that he meets the future Green Arrow, Connor Hawke. And at this point, I‚Äôm descending into fan-fic, so this is probably a good place to stop.

* And now, the ending scene. A man is shaking and huddled underneath a bridge, when he suddenly alights on fire. This is the *Burning Man* we‚Äôve previously heard about on the show. It also happens to be **Ronnie Raymond**, Caitlin‚Äôs ‚Äúdead‚Äù fianc√©e. We will know him as **Firestorm**. Now, I‚Äôm going to wait three episodes until we get to Firestorm, but‚Ä¶yeah, this is awesome. When I first saw this episode, I seriously freaked out at this moment, and even more so at the next couple of episodes. So, I‚Äôll wait to talk about Firestorm, but this will be a fun conversation when we get to it.

[Suicide Squad] Amanda Waller's true intentions.,"As seen in the trailer, Amanda Waller would not be very surprised at all if one of the members went rogue.  DC Comic book readers also know that she has an extreme hate for Batman or at least non-goverment vigilantes.  I think that her true plan is to reunite Harley Quinn and The Joker in hopes that this will drive batman back into retirement at least in the long run.

We see in the Batman V. Superman trailer that the Death in the Family Arc is what caused Batfleck to retire.  Perhaps she thinks that if the Joker is loose again the events of Death in the Family will retranspire.  There have been rumors of a robin in BvS, and the joker knows that killing robin worked last time.

I think that several members of the squadron will die and Waller will say that it was worth it.
Let me know what you think

Batman v Superman should have come out this year.,"Marvel has a headstart on DC by at least 5 years. MoS came out almost two years ago. In order to get the DCCU going, I think BvS and even Suicide Squad should have come out this year. That way you could have focused on a Wonder Woman movie and even a standalone Batman movie for next year. Then Justice League and another standalone movie for 2017. DC would have been 5 movies in their DCCU by that point with an established universe. We don't know if superhero fatigue will set I'm by the time the Green Lantern movie comes out in 2020 and they have to end up retiring the franchise early. By releasing their movies this year, they have a universe set up and if they need to, take a break when superhero movies start to go on the decline. What do you guys think? Should DC have released BvS this year, or is the current line up fine as it is?",comicbookmovies,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookmovies/comments/3dcg1c/batman_v_superman_should_have_come_out_this_year/,,Ikouze,3dcg1c,/r/comicbookmovies/comments/3dcg1c/batman_v_superman_should_have_come_out_this_year/,http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookmovies/comments/3dcg1c/batman_v_superman_should_have_come_out_this_year/,18,2015-07-15

"(BvS) The dead Robin in Dawn of Justice is Dick Grayson, not Jason Todd.","So a photo of Dick Grayson's gravestone from the set of BvS leaked a while ago. 

http://screenrant.com/batman-v-superman-set-photos-robin-dick-grayson-dead/

Um, yea that's pretty much the end of the theory. The dead Robin is clearly Dick Grayson, seems obvious to me. I'll address some of the arguments I've heard against this theory I guess. 

""The pics are fake"" - Warner Bros. had all the pics removed from the internet. I can only find articles talking about them and broken links where they used to be. 

""The gravestone is Dick's father's grave, not Dick's."" - Dick's full name is Richard John Grayson while his dad's name is just John Grayson. Also the grave is at the Wayne Mausoleum. 

""The stone says he died in the year 2000, that would be way to early for Robin to die."" It's pretty clear that the film will have Batman come out of a long retirement. In the Dark Knight Returns I'm pretty sure he had been retired for 10-15 years so 2000-2015 would be the perfect stretch of time. 

""In the comics Jason Todd is the Robin who died not Dick."" These movies don't seem to be adhering to comic lore too strictly. They killed off Pa Kent before present day even began, Batman is branding criminals with the Bat symbol, Wonder Woman has some kind of laser beam shockwave power, Lex Luthor has hair, Ma Kent tells Clark she doesn't care if he becomes a hero or not, you get the picture. 

""DC knows the fans want a live action Dick Grayson, they wouldn't kill him off before the movie even starts"" Were getting a teen titans series on TNT with Grayson as their leader. 

So yea, seems obvious that Dick is dead in the DC cinematic universe.

Why Batman V Superman needs to be good [Discussion] [Movies/TV],"This new trailer has given me a lot of faith in this film, but of course the man of steel trailer was great and had great fan reaction as well and we all know how that turned out (even though I thought it was a pretty good movie). Marvel movies have been getting increasingly formulaic, and with avengers 2 and ant man, it seems the public has started to notice. The superhero genre needs a shot in the arm to bring back the level of excitement that the avengers brought, and batman v superman could very well be that film. The DC films look to be putting their own spin on the genre to differentiate themselves from marvel's kid friendly, 'man becomes superhero and must fight evil in order to triumph' sort of formula. Not that that doesn't have a place in the genre, but that genre has to expand to retain the public's interest. Including films that tackle real world ramifications of having superheroes, and putting out films about a team of only villains or superheroes fighting one another is, in my opinion, a great way to accomplish this by taking tried and true comic book concepts that haven't really been adapted yet and trying them out. However, batman v superman is also DC's last shot at this for a while. If this movie flops, this approach is over, and I don't think the public is going to give a shit about DC for a long, long time. DC is already way less recognizable and trusted than marvel by the non-comic reading public, and I think the batman versus superman concept is one of the only things that can actually make people excited for one of their properties. If this fails, the rest of their film slate is doomed. If this fails, public opinion on superhero films will continue to fall. If this fails, the genre is going to have a very difficult recovery. 

But I am pretty optimistic. Chris Terrio of Argo fame screenwriting, Zack Snyder, the king of adapting comics faithfully, and of kickass effects, directing, pitch perfect casting (not sure about Gal Gadot but I don't know how anyone is against Eisenberg. Looks to be playing it arrogant and smart, which is fucking perfect) and a lot of hype. This could be the big one for DC. Or it could be the last nail in the coffin.

tl;dr: if this movie is shit we may be fucked

Will a good enough story in Batman v Superman make Man of Steel a better film in retrospect?,"We know that this film will deal with Superman's battle with Zod destroying half of Metropolis, and there will likely be other intrinsic tie ins with MoS's plot in the new movie. What I'm wondering is, could revelations that we're given in BvS actually make MoS better as a film? 

I definitely didn't like the flashback elements throughout most of the film, but with an ongoing story and franchise could it actually make more sense? Another major complaint I have is with the color palettes used in MoS, but what if, say, each movie in the franchise has it's own distinct color palettes? BvS is clearly colored much differently than the first movie (that alone makes me more excited for it). But imagine if the first new Batman film is grey in the Batman scenes, and brighter in the Bruce Wayne scenes, the next Superman movie is a brighter blue or red along with a Superman that isn't so brooding, and so forth. They probably won't do that, but I think it'd be cool and make the first movie's tone actually make more sense. 

I haven't seen the movie since it was in theaters, so I don't remember it that well, but I think it was a pretty well made movie at the very least.

Possible idea for where Kryptonite comes from in BvS,"So i don't really read any leaks or anything for Batman V Superman because I don't want to spoil the movie for myself, i'm not even watching any more trailers for it after the last one there but in it I saw Kryptonite.  I was thinking a good way to introduce this would be to have Kryptonite actually come from inside the earth.  What if Zod's machine that began terraforming Earth into a new Krypton did actually begin to work deep down in the earth and now bits of Kryptonite are starting to come to the surface slowly.

Superman v. Batman,"With the approaching movie, I wanted to see what people thought.  More specifically, how the hell does Batman beat Superman?  Are they going to make Superman a lot weaker to make it a fair fight?  Or make him dumb to even it out so he falls into plans?  Or will they have Batman power up ridiculously?  Or will it just be a ""lol kryptonite"" situation?

I feel like the disparity between the power levels of these characters is immense and it would make for a terrible fight, yet here we are, about to have a blockbuster based around the two fighting.  How will this go down as a good fight?  It seems like a toddler and an adult fighting and the adult just being like ""oh no, you got me haha"".

Deciphering the newspaper article in the BvS Comic-Con Trailer.,"I've been obsessively watching the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Comic-Con trailer ever since it came out, even doing a frame-by-frame analysis, and today I've decided to actively try and decipher the newspaper article that we can see Bruce Wayne [holding in the trailer](https://youtu.be/0WWzgGyAH6Y?t=55). 

I haven't gotten all that far, but I thought it'd be fun to share what I do have - and maybe some of you have found a lot more than me. I'd love to hear about it, if so, and if not, it might be fun if any of you would like to try and crack this thing with me. After all, we're all obsessed with this stuff here, are we not?

This is what I have so far. From the third column, two lines from below (right between the D and I of DIE).

*It is clear that the city will need several years to rebuild what was lost, and longer to heal the deep emotional and physical scars. Both Wayne Enterprises and Lexcorp have (...) and donating material to the cleanup efforts. Up to this point, there is over 12 million dollars allocated to the Rebuild Metropolis Fund.

I have a theory for the upcoming Batman v Superman movie,"I just watched the comic con panel for Batman v superman and Zack Snyder said some pretty interesting things. He said the suit resembling the one from DKR is not for an offensive strategy but more for ""self preservation"" and ""wasting time for something else"". I think in the film Batman hates superman after the destruction he caused in metropolis and he wants him gone. Batman only sees superman as a weapon of mass destruction and not someone who can benefit mankind. So, Batman temporarily teams up with lex Luthor to take down superman, which is why he is ""wasting time"" so they can set up supes for a trap.",batman,4,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/3dggu6/i_have_a_theory_for_the_upcoming_batman_v/,,Joeshmo04,3dggu6,/r/batman/comments/3dggu6/i_have_a_theory_for_the_upcoming_batman_v/,http://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/3dggu6/i_have_a_theory_for_the_upcoming_batman_v/,3,2015-07-16

Also assuming that Superman's power arrival as set things in motion (like mentioned in the Suicide Squad trailer about certain members having certain powers), I'm gonna make the leap/stretch that his arrival could potentially bring Todd back from the dead, or some other character in the universe will inadvertently resurrect Todd (maybe when Enchantress gains/trains her powers?). 

Knowing from the comics that Todd is an anti-hero known to flit back and forth between hero and villain, is it possible we could see him joining the Suicide Squad in a future film? It would be cool to see and it would make a great side plot for Batman, whom we know is going to be a constant thorn in the Squad's side. Todd's superhero/villain ego, Red Hood, would be a dynamic addition to the Squad and I could see a lot potentially happening over his addition.

Or am I just being too far fetched against the DC comics lore?

Theory about Lex Luthor in Batman v Superman,"I've noticed that Lex Luthor hasn't received that much attention after the release of the comic-con trailer. I read an interesting theory on batman-news.com on what he could be up to in the film. 
""Ever since¬†Man of Steel¬†came out, we knew that General Zod‚Äôs body (and head) were in the train station after that controversial neck snap scene. We also knew that there were a lot of Zod‚Äôs ships and technology laying around and that not all of them were destroyed. Somebody like Lex could take the technology and the DNA and make armor or vehicles‚Ä¶or a creature. The longstanding rumor has been that Luthor would make Doomsday from General Zod, so now that he has his head (and his body)""

Suicide Squad will most likely be R rated,"If you examine the trailer, there is a shot of Harleen before she was ""Harley Quinn"" and it shows her strapped down to a table and the Joker is touching her face. This is clearly a part of the torture scene with his gonna hurt you really really bad quote. Think about it, the whole trailer is just so dark and has a completely different vibe than Batman v Superman. There are also SATANISM signs in the trailer. What?! I'm not sure if parents would want their kids to see a movie with references to Satanism. Even if the movie does get an R rating, Will Smith is in it. This a clever decision marketing-wise because he is a huge A-lister and once people see he's in a movie, they will go see it. I predict Suicide Squad will make about 400 million or more at the box office. So what do you think? Will it be a hard R or will they just get away with a PG-13 rating with some disturbing and intense scenes?",DC_Cinematic,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/3dh2i8/suicide_squad_will_most_likely_be_r_rated/,,[deleted],3dh2i8,/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/3dh2i8/suicide_squad_will_most_likely_be_r_rated/,http://www.reddit.com/r/DC_Cinematic/comments/3dh2i8/suicide_squad_will_most_likely_be_r_rated/,9,2015-07-16

Who else loves the movie master figures? Other questions inside!,"Hey! So like the title says, I'm wondering who else loves the movie master figures?   

I love them so much! I try to collect them all (I still don't have all of The Dark Knight one's) and I'm getting super excited for the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice figures! I keep thinking of the one's they might do and it's just so exciting.  

Here's some questions for you - 

1) - So, do you like the movie master figures?  
2) - What figures do you want to see for Batman v Superman?  
3) - What figure do you have right now, that's your favorite?  
4) - What figures do you wish they did, but didn't?  

For me, I would love to see a Lex Luthor figure, Alfred, Aquaman, Doomsday (If he is even in the movie, but you never know), and definitely others.  
I would love if they had made a Talia Al Ghul figure for The Dark Knight Rises, a Lois Lane one for Man of Steel, and probably others I can't remember right now.  

Can't wait to read what you all have to say!

[x-post from DC Comics] So...Apparently Grant Morrison has a problem with Wonder Woman,"Original Source - [Screenrant](http://screenrant.com/grant-morrison-gal-gadot-wonder-woman-movie/) (It's a full article, but if you feel you got the gist of it, my observations follow.

&gt;Obviously, much of the attention for Zack Snyder‚Äôs Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has been on the eponymous superheroes, who will finally clash in live action form when the comic book movie hits theaters next spring. However, as the subtitle would suggest, Snyder‚Äôs latest project is serving as a foundation for several elements of the blossoming Justice League shared movie universe that will arrive in theaters over the next few years.

&gt;Dawn of Justice will mark the live-action cinematic debut for Diana Prince, a.k.a. Wonder Woman, who is being brought to life by Gal Gadot. The character‚Äôs involvement in the movie is largely a mystery, as she‚Äôs hardly been present in marketing materials thus far. Outside of a couple of still images, and just brief glimpses in the most recent trailer, you‚Äôd be hard pressed to know Wonder Woman is in this film at all.


&gt;Little is known about Diana‚Äôs role in the proceedings, but Gadot‚Äôs portrayal already has one high-profile individual concerned. That would be famed comics writer Grant Morrison, who worked on the graphic novel ‚ÄúWonder Woman: Earth One‚Äù to reintroduce modern readers to the character. According to him (via Nerdist), what was shown in the latest preview goes against Wonder Woman creator William Marston‚Äôs intention for the DC Comics icon:

&gt;‚Äú[The warrior woman thing is] not what [Wonder Woman creator] William Marston wanted, that‚Äôs not what he wanted at all! His original concept for Wonder Woman was an answer to comics that he thought were filled with images of blood-curdling masculinity, and you see the latest shots of Gal Gadot in the costume, and it‚Äôs all sword and shield and her snarling at the camera. Marston‚Äôs Diana was a doctor, a healer, a scientist‚Ä¶.‚Äù

&gt;Unless Morrison has seen more of the finished film, it sounds like he‚Äôs rushing to judgment a bit with this quote. Yes, a majority of Gadot‚Äôs screen time in the Comic-Con trailer is dedicated to showing Wonder Woman in action, but we have no idea what her character will actually be like in the finished product. Diana is one of Batman v Superman‚Äòs wild cards right now, as she was even absent from the official synopsis that was released a while back. All we know is she‚Äôs the supposed ‚Äúgateway drug‚Äù to the rest of the Justice League, but that could mean any number of things.

&gt;Of course, one can understand Morrison‚Äôs initial concern, as he has a great deal of admiration for the character and wants to see her done justice on the big screen. But if everything falls into place, the WB/DC filmmakers will have plenty of time to develop Wonder Woman in interesting ways. Not only will she factor into the two Justice League films, but she‚Äôll also have her own solo movie in June 2017 ‚Äì one directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster), who seems likely to spend equal time exploring the Diana and Wonder Woman sides of her persona. Gadot‚Äôs Diana could well be a doctor or scientist at times, but she is still an Amazonian warrior, after all.

&gt;And even if you disagree with Morrison‚Äôs early evaluation of movie Wonder Woman, his comments do raise an interesting thought. Diana was one of the few (only?) characters featured in the trailer to not say any dialogue, which raises the question of how meaty her part will be. Comic book movies are no stranger to being overstuffed with players, so hopefully Wonder Woman‚Äôs inclusion adds some value to Batman v Superman and isn‚Äôt something merely tacked on for the sake of a few Easter eggs. That would be a waste for such a beloved character‚Äôs feature film debut.


Now...It actually leaves me conflicted. On one hand, Grant Morrison is one of the DC stable that I tend to trust quite implicitly; he tends to be quite versed in characters (whether that be Dredd, batman or Superman), so I would *assume* that he's fairly well versed when it comes to women - he's a strong supporter of strong female protagonists in comics, and I often find myself in agreement with him. I would even go so far as to assume that he's probably seen at least *some* footage of Dawn of Justice simply from being around the DC board room.

The problem is when it comes to his opinion of Marston - any comic book fan would have at least dipped their toes into the world of Wonder Woman, Marston's views on sexuality, feminism and BDSM and how this all plays into Diana herself - my opinion though is that Diana has evolved beyond simply being the maiden of might of the 50's, and has an infinitely more developed storyline; my *hope* is that DoJ and her solo film utilises more of the *latter* source material as opposed to the former - I can't help but feel that using a tone that identified with Marston's Wonder Woman would make any appearance of her almost a parody of herself, and even painful to watch.

Of course...For me, a Wonder Woman solo film is a no brainer; we keep being told that a female superhero is a tough call, that it would be difficult to sell a story that appeals to both men and women; I entirely disagree, and I think that but using a combination of greek mythology, history and lore could make something that is truly stand out in the DC universe - think 300, with elements of Beowulf. OK, not a great example. Think 300 but Clash of the Titans (and also good). For me, I think Wonder Woman has begun to transcend simple ideals of feminism, and I think any film with her should recognise that.

I'm sorry about the ramble - I'm concerned.",comicbookmovies,4,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookmovies/comments/3dkkds/xpost_from_dc_comics_soapparently_grant_morrison/,,Atrocitusrex,3dkkds,/r/comicbookmovies/comments/3dkkds/xpost_from_dc_comics_soapparently_grant_morrison/,http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbookmovies/comments/3dkkds/xpost_from_dc_comics_soapparently_grant_morrison/,8,2015-07-17
